ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 



Adoption of Recommendations and Statement Regarding Administrative Practice and Procedure
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Administrative Conference of the United States.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) adopted two recommendations and one formal statement
at its Fiftieth Plenary Session. The recommendations concern the use of audited self-regulation as a regulatory
technique and procedures for civil forfeiture of property or other assets. The statement presents the views of the
Conference on the Social Security Administration's proposal to reengineer the disability benefits process. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Administrative Conference of the United States was established by the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C.
591-596. The Conference studies the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures
used by federal agencies in carrying out administrative programs, and makes recommendations for improvements to
the agencies, collectively or individually, and to the President, Congress, and the Judicial Conference of the United
States (5 U.S.C. 594(1)). At its Fiftieth Plenary Session, held June 16, 1994, the Assembly of the Administrative
Conference of the United States adopted two recommendations and a formal statement. 



Recommendation 94-1, The Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique, suggests that when certain
prerequisites and safeguards are present, Congress and federal agencies should consider the possibility of delegating
regulatory power to a private self-regulatory organization. The recommendation emphasizes the necessity of ensuring
the effectiveness and the fairness of the process, and identifies standards for determining whether such a delegation
may be appropriate. 

Recommendation 94-2, Reforming the Government's Procedure for Civil Forfeiture, suggests improvements
in this process. The United States Government has in recent years made increasing use of its power to confiscate the
property or assets of persons involved in illegal activities through civil forfeitures. Notice of an impending administrative
forfeiture is sent to the last known address of the owner and is published in newspapers. This system has been criticized
as unduly expensive and ineffective. The recommendation suggests that the establishment of a centrally maintained
Civil Forfeiture Registry, which would be published and made widely available, would not only provide better and
more reliable notice, it would provide a better overview of the entire forfeiture process, thus improving public
and congressional oversight. The recommendation also proposes that Congress impose a statutory 60-day time limit
on the agency to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture Registry and to send written notice of a seizure to the last known
address of the owner or interest holder in the property. 

Statement No. 17, Comments on the Social Security Administration's Proposal on Reengineering the SSA Disability
Process, constitutes the formal comments from the Administrative Conference to the Social Security Administration
on SSA's proposal. The Conference generally supported the proposed changes to SSA's procedures, which would reduce
the number of administrative stages from four to two, while offering claimants increased opportunity for face-to-face
interaction with agency staff. 

The full texts of the recommendation and statement are set out in the Appendix below. The recommendations will be transmitted
to the affected agencies and to appropriate committees of the United States Congress. The Administrative Conference
has advisory powers only, and the decision on whether to implement the recommendations must be made by the affected
agencies or by Congress. 

Recommendations and statements of the Administrative Conference are published in full text in the 

Federal Register.

 In past years Conference recommendations and statements of continuing interest were also published in full text
in the Code of Federal Regulations (1 CFR Parts 305 and 310). Budget constraints have required a suspension of this
practice in 1994. However, a complete listing of past recommendations and statements is published in the Code of Federal
Regulations. Copies of all past Conference 
recommendations and statements, and the research reports on which they are based, may be obtained from the Office
of the Chairman of the Administrative Conference. Requests for single copies of such documents will be filled without
charge to the extent that supplies on hand permit (see 1 CFR  304.2). 

The transcript of the Plenary Session is available for public inspection at the Conference's offices at Suite 500,
2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC.

Appendix Recommendations of the Administrative Conference of the United States



The following recommendations were adopted by the Assembly of the Administrative Conference on June 16, 1994: 



Recommendation 94-1, The Use of Audited Self-Regulation as a Regulatory Technique



Audited self-regulation is defined as congressional or agency delegation of power to a private self-regulatory
organization to implement and enforce laws or agency regulations with respect to the regulated entities, with powers
of independent action and review retained by the agency. This self-regulatory 
organization is often an association of regulated entities formed for the explicit purpose of self-regulation.
Audited self-regulation is an alternative for Congress to consider in legislating any regulatory program. Properly
implemented and monitored, a program of audited self-regulation may effectively advance the statutory objectives
consistent with the public interest and the interests of the regulated entities. 

In certain circumstances, this approach may result in better regulation because the agency's statute and rules are
supplemented and enforced by those entities directly involved in the regulated activity, which may have more detailed
knowledge of the operational or technical aspects of that activity. The regulatory program also may be more effective
because it can be tailored to the individual industry or group. In addition, the agency's regulatory enforcement
costs may be reduced by this approach, although such cost 
reductions should be considered only if they can be achieved without eroding the effectiveness of enforcement.

On the other hand, audited self-regulation may present the significant risks of uneven enforcement, capture of the
regulators by the regulated industry, and creating barriers to entry or competition. Where the 
potential for institutional self-interest is too great, self-regulation is undesirable. Other risks can be lessened
by requiring the self-regulatory organization to establish and follow procedures similar to those that would 
be applicable if the self-regulatory organization were an agency.
 For these procedures to work, effective interest groups must exist, and must have access to the agency, to raise concerns
about the conduct of the self-regulatory organization. And of course, the agency itself must vigilantly oversee
the activities of the self-regulatory organization and of the regulated entities themselves. 





A survey of agency experience with audited self-regulation
 reveals several common elements typically present in effective programs: (1) Industry members are organized, expert,
and motivated to comply; (2) the regulatory program requires individualized application of clear rules which can
be objectively applied; and (3) the agency itself has sufficient expertise to audit the self-regulatory activity
effectively. The survey also 
revealed that audited self-regulation programs that were terminated or not implemented lacked at least one of these
elements. 





In those cases where the prerequisites and safeguards discussed above are present, Congress and the agencies should
consider audited self-regulation as a regulatory technique.
 





Recommendation



1. Congress and agencies should consider audited self-regulation as a regulatory technique when designing, revising,
or reevaluating regulatory programs, but only where it can be effective, as specified in Paragraph 2 below, and only
where it can operate fairly, as specified in Paragraph 3 below. Audited self-regulation is defined as congressional
or agency delegation of power to a private self-regulatory organization to implement and enforce laws or agency regulations
with respect to the regulated entities, with powers of independent action and review retained by the agency. 

2. 

Effectiveness.

 Audited self-regulation can be effective if it meets the following requirements. 

a. The substantive standards, whether imposed by statute, regulation, or otherwise, are clearly stated and are capable
of objective application, even if judgments must be made in applying them. 

b. A self-regulatory organization with the ability and incentive to implement these substantive standards in cooperation
with the agency exists or can be created. 

i. 

Ability. 

The organization must have the expertise, experience, authority, and commitment to design, implement, and evaluate
effective compliance measures. It must also, by itself or in combination with other self-regulatory organizations,
have jurisdiction over all regulated entities. 

ii. 

Incentive. 

The organization must be motivated to undertake effective and fair self-regulation consistent with the public interest,
as that interest has been articulated by Congress and the agency. This motivation can be provided by, among other things:
(A) the members' common incentives; (B) effective monitoring by groups that may be harmed by noncompliance; (C) potential
legal liability of the self-regulated entities or the self-regulatory organization; or (D) the potential for direct
government regulation. 

c. The agency responsible for implementation and oversight must have the ability and incentive to implement the substantive
standards through a self-regulatory program. 

i. 

Ability. 

The agency must have (A) statutory authority, including at least the powers specified in Paragraph 2(d) below; (B)
sufficient substantive expertise; (C) knowledge of organizational behavior and internal control procedures of
the self-regulatory organization and its members; and (D) 
sufficient resources, including effective auditing capability to monitor compliance. 

ii. 

Incentive. 

The agency must have the incentive to implement the self-regulatory program effectively. Effective implementation
requires that the agency be committed to achieving the objectives of the statutory scheme through the self-regulatory
program. It also requires that the agency consider the rights and needs of the intended beneficiaries of the regulatory
program, who may be harmed by noncompliance, as well as the rights and needs of the regulated entities. 

d. The self-regulatory program is expressly authorized by legislation that includes: 

i. an explicit statement of the scope of permitted delegation to the self-regulatory organization; 

ii. authority for the agency (A) independently to enforce the law, agency regulations, and rules of the self-regulatory
organization relevant to the program; (B) to enforce the organic requirements of the self-regulatory organization
against the organization, and require that the organization in turn enforce its own rules against its members; (C)
to review all rules and enforcement actions of the self-regulatory organization relevant to the program; and (D)
to amend, repeal or supplement the rules of the self-regulatory organization or require the self-regulatory organization
to do so; and 

iii. a requirement that the agency, in promulgating its own rules or reviewing the rules of the self-regulatory organization,
examine the effects of those rules on competition. 

3. 

Fairness.

 Audited self-regulation can operate fairly only if the procedures of the self-regulatory organization ensure that
the decisionmaker is properly informed and unbiased. Procedures for adjudication and for establishing rules of
general applicability should conform generally to those that would be followed if the proceeding were conducted
by the agency. In addition to the agency's plenary review authority referred to in Paragraph 2(d)(ii)(C), the agency
should provide parties with a right of appeal. 

4. 

Access to records and proceedings of the self-regulatory organization.

 Congress and the agency should provide public access to records of the self-regulatory organization relating to
the organization's regulatory activities, to the extent such records would be available under the Freedom of Information
Act if the self-regulatory organization were an agency. Congress and the agency also should consider whether to require
any nonadjudicatory proceeding of the organization to be open to the public. 

5. 

Alternative dispute resolution.

 The rules of the self-regulatory organization should provide for use of informal and consensual procedures to resolve
disputes where appropriate.
 





Recommendation 94-2, Reforming the Government's Procedure for Civil Forfeiture 



The United States Government has in recent years made increasing use of its power to confiscate the property or assets
of persons involved in illegal activities through the civil forfeiture process. 

The law classifies forfeitures as criminal or civil according to the procedure by which the government perfects its
title in the confiscated property. Criminal forfeiture follows as a consequence of criminal 

conviction 

of the property owner. The government cannot obtain clear title until a post-trial proceeding is held. Civil forfeiture
is accomplished by civil proceedings, 

in rem, 

against the property itself. Civil forfeiture has numerous advantages over criminal forfeiture in that the property
itself is the ``defendant'' in the suit, and the property may be forfeited even if the owner is dead or has fled the United
States. 

 Over a hundred statutes authorize civil forfeiture, with most involving drug, racketeering, money laundering,
or immigration violation.

<TEXT>
 

A civil forfeiture begins with a ``seizure'' of a privately-owned property by the investigative/prosecutorial
government agency. Constitutionally, the agency must meet the probable cause test showing that there are reasonable
grounds for belief that the property has been used in the commission, or constitutes proceeds, of the crime. 

Civil forfeiture proceedings are of two types. Congress has provided for 

administrative

 forfeiture in cases where the property is cash, the value of the property is under $500,000 or is a boat, plane or car
used to carry or store drugs, or if the seizure goes uncontested. Notice of an impending administrative forfeiture
is sent to the last known address of the owner and is published in newspapers. 

A 

Judicial

 forfeiture proceeding is required when a claimant contests the seizure, when the property seized is real estate,
and when the value of the seized property (other than cash) is over $500,000. If the case proceeds, it does so in federal
district court where there is a right to a jury trial. 

This recommendation addresses a few procedural issues regarding civil forfeiture.
 Many other issues, both procedural and substantive, have been raised by courts and by critics of the forfeiture process.
 There is a fundamental issue about the fairness and effectiveness of the entire administrative civil seizure/forfeiture
process. It currently involves an extremely informal administrative process and, for the small proportion 
of judicial forfeiture cases that are taken that far, a trial in the federal district court. 






After forfeiture, an owner may petition for remission (return) or mitigation (partial return) of the property. Of
course, in many instances, especially those involving cash, no one claims ownership. According to federal common
law, the authority to grant remission or mitigation is totally at the discretion of the seizing agency. A decision
on the merits for remission or mitigation is non-reviewable by the judiciary.






Notice. The current system of using newspaper notices of the proposed forfeiture action along with a letter to the
last known address of the owner has been criticized as unduly expensive
 and ineffective. The 
establishment of a centrally maintained Civil Forfeiture Registry, which would be published and made widely available,
would not only provide better and more reliable notice, it would provide a better overview of the entire forfeiture
process, thus improving public and congressional oversight.





Time Limits. At present, federal statutes provide no time limit on the agency to provide notice to the owner of the seized
property. Unlike the requirements imposed on a person contesting the seizure to file a claim to the property, deadlines
have not been similarly imposed on the agency within which it must commence a forfeiture action in district court.
Current Department of Justice policy is to send a notice of seizure to each person known to have an ownership or possessory
interest in the seized article within 60 days of the seizure. The notice triggers the running of the time specified
by the enabling statute (usually 30 days) within which a person may file a claim to the property (thus converting an
administrative forfeiture into a judicial one). 

Congress should provide a statutory 60-day time limit on the agency to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture Registry
and to send written notice of a seizure to the last known address of the owner or interest holder in the property. Granting
extensions or waivers of the 60-day notice requirement should be within the discretion of a federal judge or magistrate,
upon a showing by the government of good cause. Failure to meet the filing time limit (absent a waiver or extension)
should result in a return of the property pending further forfeiture proceeding. 



Recommendation



1. Congress should provide for the establishment of a Civil Forfeiture Registry, centrally maintained, kept current,
and made widely available by the Department of Justice, in lieu of the current requirements to publish notices in specific
locations or specific media. The Department of Justice should then maintain the Civil Forfeiture Registry to provide
a well-known and continuing place for notifying owners of seized property about proposed forfeitures. 

2. Congress should modify the forfeiture laws to require the government to publish notice in the Civil Forfeiture
Registry and mail specific notice to the last known address of each person known to have an ownership or possessory
interest in the seized article within 60-days following seizure, recognizing that extensions or waivers are available
with appropriate safeguards against abuse. If the seizing agency fails to provide notice in the Civil Forfeiture
Registry (absent good cause) or to the last known address of the party from whom the property was seized within the time
limits, and no waiver or extension was granted, the seized article should be returned to the party pending further
forfeiture proceedings. 



Statement of the Administrative Conference of the United States



The following formal statement was adopted by the Assembly of the Administrative Conference on June 16, 1994: 



Statement No. 17 Comments on the Social Security Administration's Proposal on Reengineering the SSA Disability
Process

In April 1994, the Disability Process Reengineering Team of the U.S. Social Security Administration issued a proposal
on Disability Process Redesign (Redesign Proposal or Proposal). The SSA has asked for comments on this Proposal.
This Statement constitutes the official comments of the Administrative Conference. 
In general, the Conference supports most of the procedural changes that the Reengineering Team has proposed. Many
of these changes have been recommended by the Conference as part of its past recommendations. In this Statement, the
Conference presents its views concerning the Disability Process Redesign Proposal in light of these recommendations.
This Statement does not address those aspects of the Proposal that relate to disability decision methodology.






I. Background 


A. The Redesign Proposal 


The Reengineering Team has made a series of significant proposals to change the way that disability claims are decided.
The Proposal eliminates two of the current four administrative stages of the process, and assigns responsibility
for developing the record to a claim manager at the initial stage and to an ``adjudication officer'' at the appeal stage.
It retains the use of an administrative law judge for the appeal stage. 


B. Past Administrative Conference Recommendations 


The Administrative Conference has undertaken a series of studies over the last 15 years that address aspects of the
procedures relating to the processing of claims for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. This series
of recommendations has centered at least once on each of the many steps in the process as it currently exists. The focus
of many of these recommendations has been to improve the quality of decisionmaking by making sure that as much of the
necessary information is in the record as early in the process as possible. 
In 1978, the Conference issued Recommendation 78-2, 

Procedures for Determining Social Security Disability Claims

,
 which primarily addressed the administrative appeal stage of Social Security disability 
benefit adjudications. It recommended the continued use of ALJs, and made suggestions concerning the development
of the evidentiary hearing record, including recommendations that ALJs take more care in questioning claimants,
seek to collect as much evidence prior to the hearing as possible, make greater use of prehearing interviews, and make
better use of treating physicians as sources of information. 





In 1986, the Conference issued a recommendation on the use of nonattorney representatives in agency proceedings.
Recommendation 86-1, 

Nonlawyer Assistance and Representation

,
 urged all agencies with ``mass justice'' programs, like the Social Security disability program, to encourage the
use of nonlawyer representatives. 




In 1987, the Conference issued two recommendations relating to the disability program. Recommendation 87-6,


State-Level Determinations in Social Security Disability Cases

,
 addressed the first level of disability benefit determination and review. Recommendation 87-7, 

A New Role for the Social Security Appeals Council

,
 addressed the organization and function of the Appeals Council. Recommendation 87-6 was based on early results
from demonstration projects involving the state-level disability determination process. It recommended additional
experimentation with face-to-face procedures. Recommendation 87-7 suggested wide-ranging and substantial
changes in the working of the Appeals Council, including that it move away from its historical function as a case review
panel. The recommendation suggested that the caseload be significantly limited, and that the Appeals Council focus
on important issues on which it could issue precedential opinions. 





In 1989, the Conference issued two further recommendations affecting the disability program. Recommendation 89-10,


Improved Use of Medical Personnel in Social Security Disability Determinations

,
 addressed a variety of issues involving medical decisionmaking in disability claim determinations. It proposed
enhancement of the role of medical decisionmakers, increased effort to develop medical evidence in the record, and
improved training of the medical staff on legal and program issues. It recommended use of optional face-to-face interviews
and elimination of the reconsideration step. It also recommended that claimants be informed of deficiencies in the
medical evidence prior to the issuance of an initial determination, and that the opinion of a claimant's treating
physician be given the weight required by court decisions and SSA rules. Recommendation 89-8, 

Agency Practices and Procedures for the Indexing and Public Availability of Adjudicatory Decisions

,
 recommended that agencies index and make publicly available adjudicatory decisions of their highest level tribunals,
and further urged agencies that do not treat decisions as precedential to reexamine that policy. This general recommendation
would apply to the SSA. 






Recommendation 90-4, 

Social Security Disability Program Appeals Process: Supplementary Recommendations

,
 issued in 1990, made suggestions about several different aspects of the appeals process, aimed at improving the record
for decision. It recommended enhancement of information provided in decision documents, increased use of prehearing
conferences in cases where claimants are represented, greater use of subpoenas by ALJs, and a closing of the record
after the ALJ hearing, subject to limited opportunity to reopen based on new information. 





In 1991, the Conference addressed the representative payee program for disability benefits. Recommendation 91-3,


The Social Security Representative Payee Program

,
 addressed a number of procedural issues raised by that program. Among the recommendations was that the opportunity
for face-to-face meetings be provided. 





II. Discussion


As discussed more fully below, the Conference supports most of the Redesign Proposal's changes in the process for
adjudicating disability claims. This Statement will address issues categorized by the step in the process to which
they apply.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. Initial Decision 



1. Role of Disability Claim Manager 


The proposal would assign full responsibility for claim development and initial decisionmaking to a disability
claim manager. It also stresses the need to develop the record for decision as completely as possible at this stage.
The Conference has consistently encouraged the development of as complete a record as possible, as early in the process
as possible. Assigning that responsibility to a single well-trained person is consistent with the Conference's
recommendations. 
The Conference suggests that claim development practices be undertaken consistent with Conference Recommendation
89-10, which emphasizes the importance of full and complete factual development of disability claims, in particular
the medical aspects of such claims. Recommendation 89-10 also supports the current team approach to disability
decisionmaking, and suggests an enhanced role for medical personnel in both claim development and disability determination.
As discussed in more detail below, the Redesign Proposal retains a role for medical personnel as consultants to claim
managers. The Conference recommends that claim managers be directed to consult with medical sources regularly on
medical matters. 
The Proposal would allow third parties to help develop the information necessary to decide a claim. This concept is
a reasonable one, so long as the claim manager retains ultimate responsibility for developing an adequate record
and for making the decision on benefits based on the record. 


2. Role of Medical Personnel as Consultants 


The Redesign Proposal suggests that claim managers may use medical consultants for advice on medical issues. The
Conference, in Recommendation 89-10, suggested that the evaluation of medical evidence and decisions on medical
issues should be made by a medical professional (physician or psychologist), who should also have responsibility
for developing such evidence in the record. This recommendation was based on the two-member team approach currently
in use at the state Disability Determination Service level. The Conference continues to believe that medically-trained
personnel should have an important role in the decisionmaking process on medical evidence. Although the Proposal
does state that disability claim managers will call on the services of medical consultants, it contemplates that
the final decision on all matters, including the resolution of disputed medical issues, would rest with the claim
manager. The Conference continues to stress the need to ensure that adequate consultation with medical experts takes
place. 
Appropriate guidelines for such consultation should be developed.
 The Conference also recommends the establishment of guidelines that set priorities for the use by claim managers
of treating physicians, examining physicians, and nonexamining physicians, including specialists. 





The Conference supports the aspects of the Proposal designed to improve the quality of evidence provided by medical
sources for disability adjudications. Many of these improvements and proposals track suggestions included in Recommendation
89-10. For example, the Conference has recommended that physicians be adequately compensated for their work,
and that all contacts be documented routinely in writing and included in the record. 


3. Predenial Notice With Opportunity for Face-to-Face Interview 


The Conference supports instituting the opportunity for a face-to-face interview between the claim manager and
the claimant at the initial stage.
 Such an opportunity will not only provide the claim manager with relevant information and the chance to ask for and
get information efficiently, but it should also give claimants more confidence in the fairness of the process, by
giving them an opportunity to be heard. This may have the effect of reducing appeals, even when benefits are denied,
because the process will be seen to have increased legitimacy. 





The Conference also supports the Redesign Proposal's concept of a predenial notice. The Conference has long supported
the idea that claimants should be made aware of the deficiencies in their applications, and provided the opportunity
to correct them.
 Such steps are likely to lead to more accurate early decisionmaking. 





4. Issuance of Full ``Statement of the Claim'' Decisions 


The Conference supports the issuance of full decisions on disability benefit claims. The proposed contents for ``Statement
of the Claim'' decisions are consistent with those the Conference recommended in Recommendation 90-4. Providing
sufficient information to claimants helps them make informed decisions about future action. 


B. Elimination of the Reconsideration Step 


The Conference has also previously recommended that the reconsideration stage be eliminated if the claimant has
an opportunity for face-to-face contact with the decisionmaker at the initial stage.
 The Reengineering Team's proposal to provide such opportunity and to eliminate the redundancy of reconsideration
is an important and positive step. 





C. The Administrative Appeals Process 


1. Use of Prehearing22 Officer to Prepare Claim for Appeals 


The Conference has long supported the concept of developing the record for an appeal as early in the process as possible.
 Thus, the approach of designating someone to prepare the claim for appeal is one the Conference supports. The Conference
also supports the idea that claims be granted based on evidence in the record without a hearing.
 







The Conference also recommends that prehearing officers not be required to be attorneys, although knowledge of the
legal system and of applicable law would appear to be relevant qualifications. 


2. Use of Prehearing Conferences and Stipulations 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Conference supports the use of prehearing conferences and stipulations, which could streamline the hearing
process by narrowing issues and ensuring that the necessary evidence will be available at the hearing. In some cases,
a prehearing conference may obviate the need for a hearing. It is our understanding, based on discussions with the
Redesign Team, that the Proposal would limit prehearing conferences to cases where claimants are represented. This
is consistent with Conference recommendations.






3. Consultation With Medical Sources in Appeals 


The Conference believes that improved case development will result from the special responsibilities given to disability
claim managers at the initial decisionmaking level and to prehearing officers at the administrative hearing level.
At the same time, the Conference supports retaining authority for administrative law judges to consult with medical
sources, as needed. The Conference believes that, in doing so, ALJs should follow practices similar to those set out
in Recommendation 89-10.






4. Retention of De Novo Hearing With an Administrative Law Judge 


The Conference supports the proposed role for prehearing officers in developing the record as a way to improve the
effectiveness of ALJ decisionmaking. The Conference's recommendations, however, have been predicated on the presumption
that an ALJ would have the ultimate decisionmaking responsibility. Although others may be available to assist, the
ALJ must retain the responsibility for the content and quality of his or her decisions. 



5. Role of the Appeals Council 


The Conference has previously recommended that the Appeals Council role in the disability process be limited.
 The Conference believes that, in reviewing cases, the Council should focus on cases raising precedential questions.
The Conference supports the Proposal's idea of having the Appeals Council also review cases on a random basis, looking
at both grants and denials. The Conference also believes that the Appeals Council should have a role in providing guidance
to decisionmakers at all stages in the claims process, through the use of precedent and interpretive guidelines concerning
adjudicatory principles and decisional standards. 





D. Other Issues 


1. Training 


The Conference supports proposals to enhance training of all staff involved in processing and adjudicating disability
benefit claims.
 





2. Representatives 


The Conference has recommended that claimants be provided information about sources of representation, both attorneys
and nonattorneys.
 It also has suggested that appropriate standards be adopted concerning proper practice, and that nonattorney representatives
be encouraged.
 The Redesign Proposal contains similar types of suggestions. 






3. Precedent 


The Proposal calls for a single presentation of all substantive policies used for determination of eligibility for
benefits. This is consistent with a number of Conference recommendations that SSA make more use of agency guidance
in disability benefits cases.
 The Conference also recommends use of precedent and clear agency statements of policy to encourage uniform outcomes
among similar cases. The Appeals Council could undertake, as one of its functions, the review of ALJ determinations
for use as precedent. 





4. Reopening the Record 



The Proposal implies that the record will be closed at the ALJ level. We support the idea that the record should close
following the ALJ hearing, at a time set by the ALJ, and suggest that this be made explicit. 

The Proposal is silent on the availability of any opportunity to reopen the record following the ALJ hearing. While
the Conference does not generally encourage such reopenings, SSA should consider offering a limited opportunity
to reopen the record in appropriate cases, consistent with Recommendation 90-4(4), (5).

introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. 



Pursuant to these regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received and is reviewing the following
applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the environment:

Cancellation of a revised supplement to a final environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On January 22, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare a revised draft supplement to the final environmental impact statement
(EIS) for the Early Winters Alpine Winter Sports Study on the Okanogan National Forest was published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 2158). Because there is no longer any party proposing development of this alpine winter sport site and, subsequently,
no need for a land exchange in the project area, the Forest Service has decided to cancel this revised supplemental
EIS. The data developed and collected from the environmental and the land exchange analyses, as directed by Public
Law 101-560, is completed and will be made a part of the public record.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of finding of no significant impact.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality
regulations (40 CFR part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Regulations (7 CFR part 650); the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared
for the Moxee Watershed Project, Yakima County, Washington.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicated that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national adverse impacts to the environment. As a result of these findings, Lynn A. Brown, State
Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement is not needed
for this project.


The project purpose is to improve the water quality of the Yakima River. The major practice proposed is the conversion
of surface irrigation to drip irrigation on approximately 5,000 acres. This practice will virtually eliminate tailwater
from these fields therefore eliminating irrigation induced erosion which has contributed to poor water quality
in the Yakima River.
The other proposed conservation practices include: irrigation water management, nutrient management, and pesticide
management.
The North Yakima Conservation District will be sponsors of the proposed project. They will encourage development
and installation of conservation plans on all eligible land within the watershed. They will provide leadership through
an aggressive information and education program to encourage the application of land treatment measures necessary
for the success of this plan.
The Notice of a Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Frank R. Easter, Assistant State Conservationist (Programs).
No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Test in the International Personal Property Program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to provide advance information concerning a test of a new code of service to move international
household goods (HHG) shipments under the MTMC international through Government Bill of Lading Program (ITGBL).
MTMC is proposing to test a new code of service, (Code 3), for ITGBL HHG shipments moving between CONUS and Korea, Japan,
and Okinawa, effective with the international summer (IS95) cycle, 1 April 1995. Carrier single factor rate (SFR)
submissions for Code 3 service will include all charges and the performance services currently in the Code 4 rate except
ocean freight charges. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) over-ocean routing rates will be used for the ocean segment.
The terms, conditions, and rules, contained in the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation will apply.
Certain provisions will be added to the MTMC ITGBL rate solicitation to authorize use of the MSC ocean rates by approved
freight forwarders and will provide conditions for forwarder participation. The IS95 solicitation is scheduled
to be distributed to industry in mid October, to be effective 1 April 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

MTMC proposes testing a new code of service (Code 3) for international containerized HHG shipments moving between
CONUS and Korea, Japan, and Okinawa. Department of Defense-approved ITGBL carriers having Code 4 approval to transport
HHG shipments to/from Korea, Japan, and Okinawa, will be automatically, unless otherwise requested, approved to
participate in the test. ITGBL carrier participation and/or rate submission, is optional. The transportation SFR
for Code 3 shipments will include all services in Item 432 of the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation
except over-ocean transportation charges. MSC rates published in the MSC Container Agreement and Rate Guide will
be used for the ocean segment. Code 3 service will be in addition to the other established codes of service, such as Codes
4 and 5. Movement of these shipments will be predicted on the policy, administrative requirements, terms, conditions,
and rules, contained in the International Personal Property Rate Solicitation, the MSC Container Agreement and
Rate Guide, and are subject to the following requirements.



a. Operational Procedures



Code 3 service is defined as the movement of HHG in Type II MTMC-approved containers whereby a carrier provides origin
services, linehaul service from origin residence to a commercial ocean terminal, ocean transportation (using MSC
negotiated rates to a commercial port of discharge), linehaul to the destination residence, and destination services.

The information outlines below applies to the movement of Code 3 shipments.

<PARENT> FR940830-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



1. Authority to Use MSC Rates. 

The MSC Worldwide Container Agreement contains authority for MTMC approved ITGBL carriers to use MSC negotiated
ocean rates. Section C-5 of the Worldwide Agreement defines the Government as the U.S. Government, its agents,
and contractors. The ocean carrier is obligated in accordance with Sections C-4 and C-6 of the MSC Worldwide
Container Agreement to transport cargo tendered by the Government. The ocean carrier will perform services in accordance
with MSC contracts upon proper ordering by an authorized ITBBL carrier. 



2. Ordering Activity Designation. 

MTMC, as the Administrative Contracting Officer for MSC will designate ITGBL carriers with accepted Code 3 rates
on file, as ordering activities of the Government. As an ordering activity of the Government, the ITGBL carrier will
have authority to book containers on behalf of the Government within the limits of delegation and subject to Government
oversight. Ordering activity authority will allow the ITGBL carrier to utilize MSC negotiated rates. The ITGBL carrier
will be responsible for exercising its administrative authority in accordance with the delegation authority granted
by MTMC, and with the terms and conditions of the MSC container agreement with oversight by MTMC. ITGBL carriers designated
as ordering activities of the Government will sign an agreement acknowledging the terms, conditions, and responsibilities,
associated with the delegated authority. A listing reflecting those ITGBL carriers designated as ordering activities
of the Government will be provided to the MSC ocean carriers prior to the effective date of the cycle.



3. Withdrawal of Ordering Activity Authority. 

MTMC may revoke the ordering activity authority of any ITGBL carrier who fails to comply with the terms, conditions,
and responsibility associated with use of the MSC negotiated rates. This will preclude the ITGBL carrier from further
participation in Code 3 traffic for the remainder of the solicitation period and cycle. Repetitive violations of
ordering activity authority may result in removal of the ITGBL carrier from further Code 3 participation.



4. Ocean Carrier Cargo Allocations. 

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the low cost ocean carrier will be offered
75 percent of the available cargo on a given route. The remaining 25 percent of the cargo will be offered to other participating
ocean carriers. All Code 3 HHG shipments, under this test will be offered initially to the low cost ocean carrier and
included in the 75 percent cargo allocations. 



5. Ocean Container Bookings. 

MTMC will provide port information and administrative institutions to ITGBL carriers and adjust such instructions,
as required, to provide for compliance with HHG distribution requirements. ITGBL carriers will be required to adhere
to these instructions. ITGBL carriers will offer all Code 3 shipments to the ocean carrier establishing the lowest
MSC rate for the applicable route unless instructed to do otherwise by MTMC. If the shipments are declined by low cost
ocean carrier, a nonavailability statement will be issued by the ocean carrier and required to accompany the ITGBL
carriers billing to the appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Office. 



6. Container Utilization.

 ITGBL carriers participating in Code 3 traffic will be required to optimize ocean container utilization. Imposition
of utilization factors are necessary to incentivize optimal loading of containers since MSC rates are based on rates
per measurement ton utilizing 100 percent of the inside cubic capacity of the container regardless of the actual of
HHGs loaded in the container. (See paragraph a. 10.(b)). 



7. Coloading. 

To permit carriers ability to continue traditionally accepted commercial coloading practices, carriers may coload
Code 3 shipments. Code 3 shipments may only be coloaded in ocean containers with Code 3 shipments. The ITGBL carrier's
Ordering Activity will be revoked if it is found that Code 3 and Non-Code 3 shipments are coloaded. 



8. Payment of Ocean Charges. 

The ITGBL carrier who orders services from the ocean carrier on behalf of the Government is responsible for payment
of MSC ocean rates to the ocean carrier. Ocean freight charges shall be earned by the MSC ocean carrier upon delivery
of the shipment to the destination named in the shipping order in accordance with MSC's agreements and rate guides.
Payment by the ITGBL carrier shall be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice from the MSC ocean carrier
of evidence of delivery whichever occurs later. ITGBL carriers will be reimbursed for over-ocean movement costs
for Code 3 shipments tendered to the low cost ocean carrier or when a nonavailability statement is provided by the low
cost ocean carrier indicating the shipment was refused. 



9. Failure to Pay Ocean Carrier. 

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the MSC Container Agreement, the Government is responsible for payment
of ocean charges if the ITGBL carrier fails to pay the MSC ocean carrier. MSC will maintain a reserve fund for use in paying
the ocean carrier. MTMC will initiate set-off action against ITGBL carriers for ocean charges, applicable interest,
and any other costs incurred for nonpayment of ocean charges. Designation of ordering activity authority will be
revoked, and the ITGBL carrier will be precluded from further participation in Code 3 traffic. 



10. Reimbursement of Ocean Charges._

(a) The ITGBL carrier will be reimbursed for its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred by the use of MSC's
contract carriers based on the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment. The ITGBL carrier will be paid that portion of
the average ocean charges in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph a.10.(b). 

(b) The ITGBL carrier will be paid its pro rata share of the average ocean charges incurred under Code 3 shipments based
on multiplying the net hundredweight of the HHG shipment shipped with the ITGBL carrier against an MSC determined
ocean rate factor. The MSC ocean rate factor is based on dividing MSC's total ocean charges for the movement of a standard
40
' by 8
' by 8
'6
'
' dry ocean container (40
' standard container) of general cargo over a specific traffic channel by the average amount of net hundredweight
of HHG 
'cargo that can be loaded into that size container. The average net hundredweight of HHG cargo that can be loaded
into a 40
' standard container is calculated to be 130.41. That 130.41 net hundredweight is calculated by using a load
factor of 10 average size Type II containers (152A) in a 40 standard container. At 189 cubic feet each, these 10 average
Type II containers will hold 13,041 reduced to a hundredweight factor, divided into the MSC calculated per 40
' standard container rate for a given movement shall be the applicable ocean freight reimbursement factor.
This MSC ocean rate factor is then multiplied against the net hundredweight of the ITGBL carrier's shipment over that
channel and the ITGBL carrier is paid the resulting amount. The predetermined ocean freight reimbursement factor
for each Code 3 channel shall be computed by MSC and provided to the applicable paying office.


(c) The ITGBL carrier will bill the appropriate finance and accounting office responsible for payment of transportation
charges for Code 3 shipments. Over-ocean charges will be identified as a separate line item charge on the public Voucher
for Transportation Charges, SF-1113. An MSC Over-Ocean Charge Item will be included in Chapter V of the International
Personal Property Rate Solicitation. This item number must be reflected on the SF-1113 with the over-ocean
charge. All billings must be supported by appropriate documents identified in the Tender of Service, Figure A-8,
of the Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (PTMR), DOD 4500.34R, with the following exceptions; the
shipping order must be submitted in lieu of billing document number 8, commercial ocean bill of lading, and a copy of
the nonavailability statement must be submitted, in order to justify payment, for those instances where the low MSC
ocean carrier refused the shipment.

<DOCTITLE>Intent to Prepare Draft Restoration Plan and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, Commencement Bay Restoration
Plan, Pierce County, WA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD.




JOINT LEAD AGENCIES: 

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (U.S. Department of Commerce), Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S.
Department of the Interior).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4370d (NEPA), the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announce their intent
to prepare a draft Restoration Plan (RP) and a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Commencement
Bay Natural Resource Damage Assessment (CB/NRDA). NOAA and the Service will be joint lead agencies for this RP/EIS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The CB/NRDA is being conducted by Federal and State agencies and tribal governments identified as Natural Resource
Trustees for the Commencement Bay environment pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601, 

et seq.

 (CERCLA), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701-2761 (OPA), and other applicable law. The Trustees will
be developing a RP/EIS to help guide restoration actions associated with the CB/NRDA. The RP/EIS will develop a set
of preferred restoration alternatives and a restoration management plan and will evaluate the environmental impacts
of the proposed plan. The Programmatic EIS will also incorporate and build upon existing information developed in
the Commencement Bay Cumulative Impact Study (CG/CIS) (published 6/93) and information and policies developed
through the CB/NRDA restoration planning process. While this RP/EIS will be a document prepared under NEPA guidelines,
it is anticipated that the RP/EIS will also meet the requirements of the Washington State Environmental Policy Act,
Chapter 43.21C RCW (SEPA).

The goal of the RP/EIS is to develop a restoration management plan that will benefit the natural resources of Commencement
Bay that have been injured as a result of the release of hazardous substances or the discharge of oil. There are two objectives
associated with this goal that will help address the injured trust resources. The first is to provide within the immediate
Commencement Bay environment a diversity of sustainable habitat types using a landscape perspective to directly
benefit the injured resources. The second objective, within the larger study area, is to provide additional alternative
resource and habitat restoration or replacement opportunities, or to acquire the equivalent of the affected resources
or habitats for those injured resources that will require additional efforts to achieve or promote restoration.
Because the planning, selection, design, construction, monitoring and funding of specific restoration measures
will unfold over a period of many years, a tiered EIS process has been selected for environmental compliance.



Alternatives



A preliminary list of alternatives is being developed and will be described in initial scoping documents sent to all
agencies, organizations, and individuals on the RP/EIS mailing list, along with a listing of significant issues
identified by agencies and public comment. The scoping document will include a brief discussion regarding the basis
for the study, information concerning the alternative areas evaluated for restoration, restoration alternative
strategies, and the programmatic nature of the study at each of the alternative areas. This information would be supplemented
with graphics delineating the areas of interest and alternative configurations.



EIS Content



The draft RP/EIS will document restoration planning at a programmatic level consistent with the results of scoping.
Restoration planning will focus upon the ``key resources'' identified through the CG/NRDA process as having been
injured due to releases of hazardous substances or discharges of oil. Beginning with the information developed through
the CB/NRDA restoration planning process and the CB/CIS, the draft RP/EIS will identify habitat types and functions
significant for important life stages of one or more groups of key resources or of representative individual key resource
species.

The RP/EIS will effectively serve as a menu of restoration alternatives to function as a framework for managing the
Commencement Bay NRDA Restoration Program.

The Alternative section will be based on the following:




_Alternatives (includes discussion and establishment of the baseline condition, and not action).
_Types of restoration.
_Alternative sites (characteristics/constraints).
_Alternative restoration scenarios (putting alternative types together with alternative sites).

<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The RP/EIS will also include other elements and address other concerns as needed to complete a fully responsive NEPA
and SEPA document. The format recommended by CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 

et seq.

 and SEPA Rules (WAC 197-11-430) will be followed as appropriate.



Cooperating Agencies



Several agencies have been identified as cooperating agencies. They are: The Puyallup Tribe of Indians, the Muckleshoot
Indian Tribe, the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Environmental Protection
Agency. The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has been designated by the lead agencies as the primary agent for preparing
the RP/EIS.



Study Area



The study area for the RP/EIS includes Commencement Bay (that portion of Puget Sound enclosed within a line extending
from Brown's Point to Point Defiance); the watershed of Commencement Bay and its main tributaries (the Puyallup/Carbon
River, the White River, Hylebos Creek, Wapato Creek, Puget Creek); and Puget Sound coastal areas adjacent to Commencement
Bay (southern Vashon and Maury Islands, Dumas Bay). Within the study area, the RP/EIS will focus on those areas that
serve as habitat for or otherwise support the natural resources of Commencement Bay potentially injured as a result
of releases of CERCLA hazardous substances and discharges of oil.



Request for Comments



Your views as to the scope and content of the environmental information needed for the RP/EIS are important to the preparation
of the study report. To be most helpful, the scoping comments should clearly describe specific environmental issues
or topics which the commenter believes the document should address. This Notice of Intent will be mailed to Federal,
state, and local agencies, organizations, groups and individuals identified during the CB/NRDA process.

Scoping meetings will be scheduled to provide the public with an opportunity to engage in discussions regarding the
RP/EIS. The times and locations of the scoping meetings will be announced at a later date. Notices will be sent to all
agencies, organizations, and individuals on the RP/EIS mailing list.

The lead agencies expect to complete preparation of the draft RP/EIS and have review copies of it available by March
1995.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of deadline for submission of institutional agreement for participation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice establishes the deadline for submission of the ``Institutional Agreement For Participation In the Federal
Perkins Loan Program Expanded Lending Option (ELO)'' (ELO Participation Agreement) by those eligible institutions
that elect to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO in the 1994-95 award year (the period from July
1, 1994 through June 30, 1995). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Perkins Loan Program provides low-interest loans to financially needy students attending institutions
of higher education to help them pay their educational costs. The ELO is available for the 1994-95 award year
for institutions of higher education that participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program. 



To be eligible to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO for 1994-95, an institution must have a
Federal Perkins Loan cohort default rate of 15 percent or less as of 
June 30, 1993, and must have participated in the Federal Perkins Loan Program for the two previous award years (1992-93
and 1993-94). In addition, an institution must enter into a special ELO participation agreement with the Secretary.
An institution that elects to participate in the ELO must complete, sign, date and submit the ELO Participation Agreement
by the closing date to obtain approval. 

Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants will be required to increase the Institutional
Capital Contribution (ICC) to at least a dollar-for-dollar match with any portion of the 1994-95 award year
Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) received. Only new FCC received on or after July 1, 1994, would be matched at the
increased rate. Institutions would not match funds received prior to July 1, 1994, at the higher rate. Institutions
receiving no new FCC for the 1994-95 award year may still elect to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program
ELO. 

Institutions that become Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO participants may make loans to eligible students at higher
maximum annual and aggregate limits than is the case with 
nonparticipating institutions. ELO participating institutions that do not ultimately make any loans at the higher
ELO levels 
for the 1994-95 award year must still honor the ELO Participation Agreement to deposit in the Federal Perkins
Loan Program Fund an ICC at least equal to the 1994-95 award year FCC deposited into the Fund. All other administrative
procedures would remain the same as for institutions not participating in the Federal Perkins Loan Program ELO.

<DOCTITLE>Intent to Repay to the Idaho State Division of Vocational Education Funds Recovered As A Result of A Final Audit Determination
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to award grantback funds. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under section 456 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), 20 U.S.C. 1234e (1982) (in effect in August of 1988
when the final audit determination was received by the auditee), the Secretary of Education (Secretary) intends
to repay to the Idaho State Division of Vocational Education (Idaho), under a grantback arrangement, an amount equal
to 75 percent of the principal amount of funds recovered by the U.S. Department of Education (Department) as a result
of the final audit determination in this matter. The Department's recovery of funds followed a settlement reached
between the parties under which Idaho refunded a total of $115,000 in principal to the Department in full resolution
of the Department's final audit determination. This notice describes Idaho's plan for the use of the repaid funds
and the terms and conditions under which the Secretary intends to make those funds available. This notice invites
comments on the proposed grantback. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
A. Background 


Under a settlement agreement between the Department and Idaho, the Department recovered $115,000 from Idaho in full
resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Idaho's State Division of Vocational Education, covering fiscal
years (FYs) 1983 through 1985. 
The Department's original claim of $376,538 was contained in a final letter of determination issued by the Assistant
Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education on August 8, 1988. The claim arose from findings related to Idaho's administration
of its vocational education program under provisions of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, 20 U.S.C. 2301, 

et seq. 

(1982) (VEA). In the August 8, 1991 letter, the Assistant Secretary determined that Idaho had violated the prohibition
against supplanting State and local funds with Federal funds awarded under the VEA. The supplanting prohibition
was contained in section 106(a)(6) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2306 (a)(6))(1982), in effect at the time. The Assistant Secretary
had also determined that Idaho had improperly awarded vocational education funds to local educational agencies
(LEAs) that failed to meet the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement in section 111(b)(1) of the VEA (20 U.S.C. 2311(b)(1))(1982),
in effect at that time. 
In responding to these findings, Idaho asserted that the MOE violations resulted when it misinterpreted the VEA's
MOE requirements, using the wrong years when calculating MOE for compliance purposes. Idaho further asserted that
the supplanting violations resulted from Idaho's attempts to mitigate potential maintenance of effort problems
at the local level. The VEA requirements relating to local maintenance of effort, which were among the primary subjects
of the August 8, 1988 final letter of determination issued to Idaho, are no longer in effect. Under the current program
authority, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins II), local educational
agencies (LEAs) are not required to maintain local effort (20 U.S.C. 2463(a). 
The settlement negotiations that followed Idaho's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's August 8, 1988 determination
in this matter culminated in a settlement agreement in which Idaho agreed to repay $115,000 to the Department. The
settlement agreement was executed on September 29, 1991. On December 11, 1991, the Department received full payment
from Idaho in the amount of $115,000.

B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 


Section 456(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234e(a), the authority applicable to this grantback request, provides that whenever
the Secretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination with respect to any applicable program,
the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program and may arrange to repay to
the State or local education agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered
funds. The Secretary may enter into this grantback arrangement if the Secretary determines that_
(1) The practices and procedures of the State or local education agency that resulted in the audit determination have
been corrected, and the State or local agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the
applicable program; 
(2) The State or local agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback
arrangement, which meets the requirements of the program, and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that
was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 
(3) The use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State or local agency's
plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. 


C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 


Pursuant to section 456(a)(2) of GEPA, Idaho has applied for a grantback of $86,250, or 75 percent of the $115,000 repaid
to the Department under the settlement agreement, and has submitted a plan for use of the proposed grantback funds,
consistent with Perkins II, currently in effect. Generally, Idaho plans to purchase vocational-technical training
equipment to improve vocational-technical programs in Idaho's State system of vocational and applied technology
institutions. 
Specifically, Idaho plans to utilize the requested grantback funds totaling $86,250 to_

(1) Replace outdated equipment in the electronics program at North Idaho College, School of Vocational-Technical
Education by purchasing two Oscilloscopes ($7,000); 
(2) Purchase two Pentium Work Stations necessary for establishing an interdivisional CD ROM Instructional Lab at
Lewis-Clark State College, School of Technology ($5,625); 
(3) Purchase equipment needed by Boise State University, College of Technology, to implement an Academic Skills
Development unit at the Canyon County Center ($23,445); 
(4) Purchase updated equipment for the Licensed Practical Nurse and Welding programs at the College of Southern Idaho
School of Vocational-Technical Education ($12,500); 
(5) Purchase equipment for establishing an integrated learning experience laboratory at Idaho State University,
School of Applied Technology ($22,680); and 
(6) Purchase an Eberline HBM-1 Hand/Foot counter to be used in the Radiation Safety program at Eastern Idaho
Technical College ($15,000). 
The postsecondary institutions for which Idaho plans to purchase equipment with the grantback funds will participate
with comprehensive high schools in the various regions in which the institutions are located throughout the State
to deliver Tech-Prep programs and coordinate initiatives for future delivery of youth apprenticeship training.
As is indicated in Idaho's grantback plan, the additional equipment Idaho plans to purchase will serve to advance
the quality of programs delivered by, and coordinated through, the postsecondary State system, resulting in Statewide
benefit to vocational education, and maximizing the impact of the grantback funds. 
Idaho's plan further indicates that these equipment purchases are intended to improve vocational-technical programs
by maintaining high-quality State programs with state-of-the-art training stations. These training stations
will be of critical importance in advancing the development of Idaho's workforce. Laboratories in the postsecondary
vocational-technical education system will provide preparatory training essential for new entrants into highly
skilled occupations. In addition, industry upgrade and retraining of employees will be provided on the campuses
of Idaho's postsecondary system of technical institutions.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
A. Background 


Under a Settlement Agreement negotiated between the Department and Iowa, the Department recovered $127,600 from
Iowa in full resolution of all claims arising from an audit of Iowa's State Department of Education, covering fiscal
year (FY) 1987. 
The Department's original claim of $338,128 was contained in a final letter of determination issues by the Assistant
Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education (Assistant Secretary) on September 29, 1989. The claim arose from findings
related to Iowa's allocation of vocational education program payroll expenditures under provisions of the Carl
D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 2301, 

et seq. 

(1988) (Perkins I). In the September 29, 1989, letter the Assistant Secretary determined that Iowa had violated the
Federal requirements that salaries of employees chargeable to more than one program o other cost objectives be supported
by appropriate time distribution records. The Federal requirements are derived from Office of Management and Budget
Circular No. A-87, Attachment B. 
The settlement negotiations which followed Iowa's appeal of the Assistant Secretary's September 29, 1989, determination
in this matter culminated in a tentative Settlement Agreement being reached between the parties in which Iowa agreed
to repay $127,600 to the Department. The Settlement Agreement was executed on February 5, 1991. On February 20, 1991,
the Department received full payment from Iowa in the amount of $127,600. 


B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 


Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following a
final audit determination, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for the program
and may arrange to repay to the State or local agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent
of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this grantback arrangement if the Secretary determines that:

(1) The practices and procedures of the State or local agency that resulted in the audit determination have been corrected,
and the State or local agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable program;

(2) The State or local agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback
arrangement which meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that
was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 
(3) The use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State or local agency's
plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. 


C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 


Pursuant to section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, Iowa has applied for a grantback of $95,700_75 percent of the $127,600 repaid
to the Department_and has submitted a plan for use of the proposed grantback funds, consistent with the Carl D. Perkins
Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 (Perkins II). Iowa plans to utilize the requested grantback
funds, totaling $95,700, to purchase computer equipment, software, and printers to be used to design new systems
and improve existing systems of administering Perkins II, including: (1) Reviewing local applications; (2) monitoring
and evaluating program effectiveness; (3) providing technical assistance to grant recipients; (4) ensuring compliance
with all applicable Federal laws, including required services and activities for individuals who are members of
special populations; and (5) supporting the activities of technical committees established under 34 C.F.R.  403.12(b)(1).
Iowa's plan further indicates that this equipment will supplement and enhance Iowa's ability to achieve the goals
and objectives of the current State plan (FYs 1995 and 1996). 
The equipment purchased with the grantback funds will permit administrative activities under Perkins II funds to
use a local area network and all personnel involved in administering the Perkins II programs will have direct access
to that network and information regarding Perkins II grant awards, recipients, and applications. The results of
the use and availability of this equipment are expected to be (1) Improved quality and compliance monitoring, and
the evaluation of program effectiveness by facilitating timely access to needed information and standardizing
report formats; (2) improved capacity for staff to provide, in a more timely manner, written responses to requests
for technical assistance and to track technical issues; (3) shared information among staff responsible for Perkins
II administration through use of an electronic mail system; (4) reduction in time spent preparing reports; and (5)
facilitation of the collection of data and statistical analysis leading to better evaluation and targeting of technical
assistance to programs and populations with the greatest needs. 


D. The Secretary's Determination 


The Secretary has carefully reviewed the plan submitted by Iowa. Based upon that review and a review of other information,
the Secretary has determined that the conditions under section 459 of GEPA have been met. This determination is based
upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is not accurate or complete,
the Secretary is not precluded from taking appropriate administrative action. In finding that the conditions of
section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending audit recommendations
or final audit determinations.

 Department of Energy (DOE) .


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Request for Comments on Least Cost Energy Strategy Technology Assumptions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the Secretary of Energy to prepare a least-cost energy plan a resource and technology
inventory of the least-cost energy strategy. The inventory (1) provides a description of each current and anticipated
primary energy input available to the U.S. economy, (2) describes the system for electricity generation and distribution,
and (3) lists available and anticipated energy technologies that are sufficiently defined so as to permit measurement
or estimation of their cost and effectiveness over the period from the present to the year 2015. 


This notice summarizes work in progress and invites public comment on the appropriate content for the energy resource
and technology inventory. We are particularly interested in suggestions for expansion of the list of efficient end-use
technologies expected to be available by the year 2010, and their cost and performance parameters. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background 
II. Content of the Energy Resource and Technology Inventory 
III. Alternative Least-Cost Concepts 
IV. Least-Cost Energy Modeling 
V. Next Steps 


I. Background 


Section 1602 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) requires the Department to provide a Least-Cost Energy Strategy
(LCES) to accompany the National Energy Policy Plan (NEPP) it submits pursuant to the legislation that established
the Department. Implicitly, EPAct recognizes that the LCES and the NEPP are distinct, reflecting in part the fact
that least-cost modeling exercises may fail to account for important real-world considerations that may enter into
energy policy formulation. Notwithstanding this distinction, the LCES can be an important source of insights for
use in developing energy policy. It can also provide important insights into other issues facing the Department,
such as strategic planning, the identification of research and development priorities, long-term climate mitigation
policy, and sustainable development initiatives, by identifying energy-related technologies that have the largest
leverage on attainment of social objectives related to the nexus of energy and economic growth.

The least-cost strategy will provide a list of policy options that, when implemented, could meet the goals and reflect
the priorities outlined in Section 1602 of EPAct. The least-cost strategy will call upon available and anticipated
resources and technologies to satisfy final energy demands at minimum long-run cost, subject to these goals and priorities.
Section 1602(a) lists the following goals: 
 Stabilization and eventual reduction in the generation of greenhouse gases 
 An increase in the efficiency of the Nation's total energy use by 30 percent over 1988 levels by 2010 
 An increase in the percentage of energy derived from renewable resources by 75 percent over 1988 levels by the
year 2005
 A reduction in the nation's oil consumption from the 1990 level of approximately 40 percent of total energy
use to 35 percent by the year 2005.
 In addition, Section 1602(d) lists the following energy production, utilization, and energy conservation
priorities: 
 Implement standards for more efficient use of fossil fuels; 
 Increase the energy efficiency of existing technologies; 
 Encourage technologies, including clean coal technologies, that generate lower levels of greenhouse gases;

 Promote the use of renewable energy resources, including solar, geothermal, and sustainable biomass, hydropower,
and wind power; 
 Affect the development and consumption of energy and energy efficiency resources and electricity through
tax policy; 
 Encourage investment in energy efficient equipment and technologies; and 
 Encourage the development of energy technologies, such as advanced nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, that
produce energy without greenhouse gases as a byproduct, and encourage the deployment of nuclear electric generating
capacity. 


II. Content of the Energy Resources and Technology Inventory 


Section 1602(b) of EPAct requires an inventory of energy resources and technology. Conservation technologies,
which reduce the amount of energy required to provide a given energy service, are considered as energy technologies
for purposes of this inventory. 
As part of the inventory, known and anticipated primary energy inputs will be inventoried. These include coal, oil
and gas (both domestic and imported), renewable sources (including diverse solar forms, biomass, wind and ocean
energy, hydro, geothermal, and municipal waste methane), nuclear, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels and coal gases.

Summaries of cost and performance parameters for specified technologies in the existing information base are available
upon request. This technology information is structured in a format suitable for least-cost modeling purposes.
For example, an existing electricity conversion technology, a coal combined cycle plant fueled with bituminous
coal, might be described as follows (parameter values are illustrative): 


 

Some technologies included in the inventory, such as the power plant example presented above, are cohesive single
engineering processes. In other cases, a technology in the inventory will reflect an aggregation of engineering
innovations, reflecting our inability to separately model each individual device. For example, a future vehicle
technology might embody several innovations such as ultra light-weight construction, low rolling resistance tires,
hybrid propulsion with automatic engine shut-off, and regenerative braking. 
Suggestions and comments are invited on both the addition of categories for the Energy Resource and Technology Inventory
and for the nomination of specific technologies to be included. To be considered for inclusion, a technology must
be sufficiently concrete that parameters for its cost, performance and applicability to the U.S. economy are discernible.

Respondents are invited to suggest either single technologies or logical aggregates of technologies, as in the examples
above, so long as the performance parameters can be described in terms similar to those in the example provided above.
Respondents are requested to provide performance parameters in a standard format (Appendix A) for technologies
that they nominate for the technology inventory, but may supplement this minimum requirement with additional information.

III. Least-Cost Concepts 



The term ``least-cost'' is open to various interpretations. Depending on how the term is defined, a wide variety of
energy strategies might be categorized as meeting a least-cost criterion. It is our intent to explore strategies
consistent with a variety of ``least-cost'' concepts reflecting alternative treatments of issues including, but
not limited to, private versus social cost minimization, environmental impacts, and the role of non-modeled attributes
and institutional factors. 


Private and Social Cost Minimization


It is widely accepted that private and social costs may fail to coincide unless all markets are perfectly competitive.
Energy-related markets provide many instances where the assumption of competition may be called into question.
For example, pricing in electricity markets, which are generally subject to economic regulation at the state level,
are based on average, not marginal, costs. Least-cost decisions based on the prices actually paid by electricity
users may differ from least-cost decisions based on marginal costs. Capital markets provide another example of possible
departures from perfect competition. Capital costs may differ significantly from the social opportunity cost of
investment, and vary widely across and within groups of decisionmakers. Projects that minimize costs using social
discount rates may fail to do so at discount rates reflecting the opportunity cost of capital faced by decisionmakers
in the market. 

DOE plans to consider a wide range of cases that reflect the differences between social and private cost minimization,
and consider how each affects least-cost choices. 


Environmental Impacts


Environmental impacts can also enter into the definition of a ``least cost'' energy strategy. For example, in a case
where two technologies that differ widely in energy efficiency can be used to provide the same energy service, purchasers
will often ignore the social costs of environmental impacts that may be associated with higher levels of energy use.
Theory and regulatory practice in some states suggests that this issue can be addressed by incorporating a ``shadow
price'' for environmental impacts in the least-cost objective function. The least-cost strategy will consider
alternative approaches to addressing the impact of recognizing environmental costs on least-cost choices. 



Role of Non-Modeled Attributes and Institutional Factors


No model can adequately capture the full detail of all influences on energy-related decisions. For example, decisions
regarding personal transportation technologies may involve issues such as safety, performance, and room, as well
as tradeoffs between acquisition cost and fuel cost. Institutional factors, such as the divorce between ownership
and tenancy in many commercial buildings, can also have an important influence on energy-related decisions. Ignoring
the range of attributes that enter into consumer decisions or institutional factors could lead to ``apples to oranges''
cost comparisons that do not compare alternative approaches to providing the same service. On the other hand, adoption
of a pure ``revealed preference'' approach, in which the fact that a particular technology is used in the market is
prima facie evidence of its least-cost nature, is both tautological and inconsistent with the spirit of the least-cost
strategy exercise. Given the unsuitability of the two extremes, we intend to explore a range of intermediate cases.


The public is invited to comment on these issues, as well as others that may bear on the interpretation or definition
of the ``least-cost'' concept. 


IV. Least-Cost Modeling 



The methods selected for developing the least cost energy plan include use of the optimization model known as MARKAL-MACRO
described in ``MARKAL-MACRO: A linked model for energy-economy analysis,'' BNL-47161, Brookhaven
National Laboratory, February 1992. Copies of this report are available by request from the Office of Economic Analysis
and Competition (202) 586-4767. 

MARKAL-MACRO links the MARKAL model that is used to determine least-cost provision of fixed end-use energy
service demands with the substitution opportunities between energy services and other productive inputs in MACRO.
MARKAL is an optimization model that minimizes the cost of providing its target level of energy services drawing on
the available set technology and resources. Information from the energy resource and technology inventory is directly
reflected in the MARKAL data structure, so that changes in the parameters for technologies already represented or
the inclusion of new technologies may significantly influence the modeling results. 

In MACRO the inputs of capital, labor and energy services are substitutes for each other under an assumption of diminishing
marginal returns. With the link between MARKAL and MACRO, rising energy costs can change the composition of energy
supply, of energy technologies and of energy investments (through MARKAL), and may also change the balance among
energy services, labor and capital input decisions, and affect future output levels (via the MACRO link).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE)
will conduct a workshop to discuss issues related to the Office's draft strategic plan. A notice of availability for
public comment on the draft strategic plan was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 14, 1994. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The draft strategic plan sets forth EE's goals, objectives, and strategies for program implementation. EE will use
this draft document as part of a comprehensive planning process involving stakeholders and oriented toward careful
identification and thorough analysis of strategic issues. The outcome of the effort will be a final version of the
strategic plan and a five-year program plan. 


The draft strategic plan is divided into four sections: overview, mission and vision, goals and objectives, and EE
strategy. The EE goals and objectives are aligned with those expressed in the Department of Energy's strategic plan,


Fueling a Competitive Economy. 

The strategy section addresses EE's technology, market, and organizational strategies. A series of short appendices
is also included in the draft strategic plan: situation analysis, description of EE stakeholder categories, description
of EE sectors' individualized missions, and evolution of EE's strategic planning process. 
As part of its strategic planning process, EE is sponsoring the development of ten issue papers that analyze driving
forces and trends and present options for EE's objectives and strategies vis-a-vis sustainable development, pollution
prevention, electric utility restructuring, natural gas utilization, and other issues. Participation in the workshop
discussion is by invitation, and limited to individuals who have been actively involved in the analysis and review
of these issues on behalf of EE. 
The purpose of the workshop is to provide feedback to EE on whether its draft strategic plan adequately addresses needs
identified in issues analyses. Workshop participants will review the goals, objectives and strategies in the draft
strategic plan to see if they are consistent with the issues analyses. Anticipated products from the workshop include
options for revised or new goals and objectives; technology, market, and organizational strategies that better
reflect the insights gained in the issues analyses; and ideas for near-term activities designed to set an immediate
course for progress on each issue. 
The workshop will be structured to elicit individual views, not to reach consensus. Members of the general public
are invited to observe the workshop, and submit written comments on the draft strategic plan by the previously noticed
September 30 deadline. The views expressed at the meetings will be considered in revising the strategic plan.

 Notice of Proposed Implementation of Special Refund Procedures.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement
of $100,697.87, plus accrued interest, in refined petroleum product violation amounts obtained by the DOE pursuant
to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order issued to Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay), Case No. LEF-0074. The OHA has
tentatively determined that the funds obtained from Beacon Bay, plus accrued interest, will be distributed to customers
who purchased gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
to eligible claimants $100,697.87, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial
Order. In the Remedial Order, the DOE found that, during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay
had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum
price regulations.



The OHA has tentatively determined to distribute the funds obtained from Beacon Bay in two stages. In the first stage,
we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay who may have been injured by overcharges.
The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section IV of the Proposed
Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the number
of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Beacon Bay.

If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance
with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07.
Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be provided prior to the acceptance
of claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting
parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding

Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy



Implementation of Special Refund Procedures





Name of Firm: 

Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc.



Date of Filing: 

July 20, 1993.



Case Number: 

LEF-0074.

On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to distribute the
funds which Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order.
Beacon Bay has remitted $100,697.87 pursuant to the order, to which $3,131.82 in interest has accrued as of July 31,
1994. In accordance with the provisions of the procedural regulations at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (subpart V), the
ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects
of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan
to distribute these funds.



I. Background



During the period relevant to this proceeding, Beacon Bay operated 11 retail service stations in Southern California.
The ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Beacon Bay on July 29, 1980. The PRO alleged that, during the period
August 1, 1979, through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling
price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The DOE amended the PRO and issued a Final Remedial Order
on June 21, 1982, after considering Beacon Bay's objections to the PRO. 

Beacon Bay Enterprises, 

9 DOE   83,039 (1982). On August 23, 1982, Beacon Bay appealed the DOE's Final Remedial Order to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC issued a Proposed Order, on November 15, 1982, 

Beacon Bay Enterprises, 

21 FERC   62,295 (1982), and an Order, on January 25, 1983, 

Beacon Bay Enterprises, 

22 FERC   61,059 (1983) the two of which affirmed and adopted the DOE's Final Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has since
remitted $100,697.87 to the DOE, in compliance with the Remedial Order, which is now available (the Beacon Bay Remedial
Order fund) for distribution through Subpart V.

II. Jurisdiction and Authority 


The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan for the distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, see 

Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 

15 U.S.C.   4501 et seq., 

Office of Enforcement, 

9 DOE   82,508 (1981); 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE   82,597 (1981) (

Vickers

). 
We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Beacon Bay Remedial
Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth
the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. We intend to publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested
parties before taking the actions proposed in this Decision. Comments regarding the tentative distribution process
set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


III. Proposed Refund Procedures 


We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. In the
first stage, purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order may submit Applications
for Refund. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally will fall
into the following categories: (i) end-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as cooperatives; and (iii) resellers
and retailers. 
A. 

Claims Based Upon Overcharges.

 
In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline
from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order_August 1979 through March 1980. If the gasoline was
not purchased directly from Beacon Bay, the claimant must establish that the gasoline originated with Beacon Bay.
Additionally, a reseller or retailer claimant, except one who chooses to utilize the injury presumptions set forth
below, will be required to make a detailed showing that it was injured by Beacon Bay's overcharges. This showing will
generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller or retailer claimant will be required to show that it
had ``banks'' of unrecouped increased product costs in excess of the refund claimed.

1

 Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficient to establish injury, a claimant must additionally
provide evidence that market conditions precluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs
associated with the overcharges. See 

Vaqueros Energy Corp./Hutches Oil Co. Inc.,

 11 DOE   85,070 at 88,105 (1983). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration that a firm suffered a competitive
disadvantage as a result of its purchases from Beacon Bay. See 

National Helium Co./Atlantic Richfield Corp.,

 11 DOE   85,257 (1984), 

aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. 

v. 

DOE, 

618 F. Supp. 1199 (D. Del. 1985). 




Our experience also indicates that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund
process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient
manner possible. See, 

e.g., Marathon Petroleum Co., 

14 DOE   85,269 (1986) (

Marathon

). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R.
205.282(e). Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 
1. Calculation of Refunds. First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of
Beacon Bay's sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Order. In accordance with this presumption,
refunds are made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis.

2

 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally
required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 




Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of the Remedial Order fund is equal to the number
of gallons purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount.
In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.0690. We derived this figure by dividing the amount of the Remedial
Order fund, $100,697.87, by 1,460,321 gallons, the volume of gasoline which Beacon Bay sold from August 1, 1979, through
March 31, 1980. A claimant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable
share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest.

3

 




In addition to the volumetric presumption, we also propose to adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for
claimants in each category listed below. 
2. End-Users. 
In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we propose to adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer
of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges
resolved by the Remedial Order. See, 

e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,

 12 DOE   85,069 at 88,209 (1984) (

TOGCO

). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls
during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price
increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices
of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. 

Id.

 We therefore propose that the end-users of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay need only document their purchase volumes
from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured
by the overcharges.

<TEXT>
 

3. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. 
We further propose that, in order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services
are regulated by a governmental agency, 

i.e. 

a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost savings to its
member-purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, sold
to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will pass any refund
received through to its customers or member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish
the restitution, and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group of the receipt
of the refund. See 

Marathon, 

14 DOE at 88,514-15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any
overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be
passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls
its business operations would ensure that the overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through to its
member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury.

4

 




4. Resellers and Retailers. a. Small Claims Presumption. 
We propose to adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that a firm which resold gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay and
requests a small refund was injured by the overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a reseller or retailer
seeking a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond
documentation of the volume of gasoline it purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order.
See 

TOGCO,

 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering
the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claims the expense might possibly exceed
the potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive
injured parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption is desirable
in that it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner.

5

 




b. Mid-Level Claim Presumption. 
In addition, a reseller or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding interest,
may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share.

6

 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced
some injury as a result of the overcharges. See 

Marathon,

 14 DOE at 88,515. In some prior special refund proceedings, we have performed detailed analyses in order to determine
product-specific levels of injury. See, 

e.g., Getty Oil Co.,

 15 DOE   85,064 (1986). However, in 

Gulf Oil Corp., 

16 DOE   85,381 at 88,737 (1987), we determined that based upon the available data, it was more accurate and efficient
to adopt a single presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all mid-level claimants, regardless of the refined
product that they purchased, based upon the results of our analyses in prior proceedings. We believe that approach
generally to be sound, and we therefore propose to adopt a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level
claimants in this proceeding. Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation
of its purchase volumes of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the Remedial Order period in order to be eligible to receive
a refund of 40 percent of its total allocable share or $5,000, whichever is greater.

c. Spot Purchasers. We propose to adopt a rebuttable presumption that a reseller or retailer that made only spot purchases
from Beacon Bay did not suffer injury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spot purchasers
generally had considerable discretion as to the timing and location of their purchases, and therefore would not have
made spot market purchases from a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through the full amount of the
firm's selling price to their own customers. 

See, e.g., Vaqueros, 

8 DOE at 85,396-97. Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specific and detailed evidence to rebut the
spot purchaser presumption and to establish the extent to which it was injured as a result of its spot purchases from
Beacon Bay.

B. 

Refund Applications Filed by Representatives. 

In addition, we propose to adopt the following procedures relating to refund applications filed on behalf of applicants
by ``representatives,'' including refund filing services, consulting firms, accountants, and attorneys. See


Texaco Inc., 

20 DOE  85,147 (1990). Each such filing service shall, contemporaneously with its first filing in the Beacon
Bay proceeding, submit a statement indicating its qualifications for representing refund applicants and containing
a detailed description of the solicitation practices and application procedures that it has used and plans to use.

9

 This statement should contain the following information:

10

 






(1) A description of the procedures used to solicit refund applications in the Beacon Bay proceeding and copies of
any solicitation materials mailed to prospective Beacon Bay applicants; 
(2) A description of how the filing service obtains authorization from its clients to act as their representative,
including copies of any type of authorization form signed by refund applicants; 
(3) A description of how the filing service obtains and verifies the information contained in refund applications;

(4) A description of the procedures used to forward refunds to its clients; 
(5) A description of the procedures used to prevent and check for duplicate filings. 
Upon receipt of this information, we may suggest alteration of a filing service's procedures if they do not conform
to the procedural requirements of 10 C.F.R. Part 205 and this proceeding. 
Second, we will require strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10 C.F.R.  205.283,
particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant.

Third, in any case where an application has been signed and dated before the issuance of the final Decision and Order
in this proceeding, we will require a certification statement, signed and dated by the applicant after the date of
the issuance of the final Decision and Order. This certification should state that the applicant has not filed and
will not file any other Application for Refund in the Beacon Bay proceeding and that, after having been provided a copy
of the final Decision and Order, it still authorizes that filing service to represent it. 
Fourth, we will require from each representative a statement certifying that it maintains a separate escrow account
at a bank or other financial institution for the deposit of all refunds received on behalf of applicants, and that its
normal business practice is to deposit all Subpart V refund checks in that account within two business days of receipt
and to disburse refunds to applicants within 30 calendar days thereafter. Unless such certification is received
by the OHA, all refund checks approved will be made payable solely to the applicant. Representatives who have not previously
submitted an escrow certification form to the OHA may obtain a copy of the appropriate form by contacting: 



Marcia B. Carlson, HG-13, Chief, Docket & Publications Branch, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department
of Energy, Washington, D.C. 20585.



Finally, the OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications
submitted by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in the final Decision and Order in this
proceeding. 
C. 

Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage. 


We propose that any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided be distributed in accordance with
the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C.   4501-07.
The PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not
be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and
any funds in the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution
to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the PODRA. 


It Is Therefore Ordered That: 
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. pursuant to the Remedial Order
issued on June 21, 1982, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership; Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the proposed Cove Point LNG
Peakshaving Project



August 24, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(EA) on the liquefaction unit and recommissioning of existing facilities proposed by Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership
(Cove Point LNG) in the above-referenced docket.

The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of:

 The construction and operation of a 15.0 million cubic feet per day liquefaction unit; and

 Recommissioning of onshore facilities at Cove Point LNG's existing Cove Point LNG terminal. 

The purpose of the proposed project would be to provide up to 5,000,000 dekatherms of storage and up to 1,000,000 dekatherms
per day sendout for peak winter demand.

The EA will be placed in the public files of the FERC on August 26, 1994 and will be available for public inspection at:
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104,
Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208-1371.

Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. 

A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental
Review and Compliance Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7303, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington,
DC 20426, (202) 208-0980.

Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP94-59-000,
and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20426.

Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than September 26, 1994, to ensure consideration
prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should be sent to Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental
Project Manager, Room 7303, at the same address.

Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214).

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your comments considered.

Additional information about this project is available from Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental Review and Compliance
Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208-0980.

<DOCTITLE>High Island Offshore System; Motion to Place Suspended Tariff Sheets Into Effect</DOCTITLE>


August 24, 1994.


Take notice that on August 18, 1994, High Island Offshore System (HIOS), pursuant to Section 4 (e) of the Natural Gas
Act and  154.67 of the Commission's Regulations, filed to place into effect on September 1, 1994, subject to
refund, the tariff sheets reflecting a change in rates and charges that were suspended in this proceeding by the Commission's
Order of March 31, 1994.
In addition, in accordance with the Commission's May 31, 1994, order clarifying the March 31, 1994, suspension order,
HIOS moves to place into effect on September 1, 1994, the suspended tariff sheets, without refund condition, which
eliminate its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism.
On March 1, 1994, HIOS filed revised tariff sheets with the Commission that provided for a general increase in the rates
for HIOS' jurisdictional transportation services. In such filing, HIOS also included tariff sheets which eliminated
its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism. On March 31, 1994, the Commission issued an order that, among other
things, accepted HIOS' tariff sheets and suspended them for five months, or until September 1, 1994. As to the tariff
sheets which eliminated HIOS' Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism, the Commission provided in its March
31, 1994, suspension that they could go into effect on September 1, 1994, subject to refund and hearing. However, in
its May 31, 1994, ``Order Clarifying Previous Order and Denying Rehearing'' the Commission clarified that the tariff
sheets which eliminated the Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism could go into effect on September 1, 1994,
without refund condition and without being subject to a hearing.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before August 31, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Public Participation Policy



Public Participation



Public participation is open, ongoing, two-way communication, both formal and informal, between the Department
of Energy and its stakeholders. This steady, interactive communication enables each party to learn about and better
understand the views and positions of the other. The Department recognizes the many benefits to be derived from public
participation, for both stakeholders and DOE. Public participation provides a means for the Department to gather
the most diverse collection of opinions, perspectives, and values from the broadest spectrum of the public, enabling
the Department to make better, more informed decisions. Public participation benefits stakeholders by creating
an opportunity to provide input and influence decisions.



Policy



Public participation is a fundamental component in program operations, planning activities, and decision-making
within the Department. The public is entitled to play a role in Departmental decision-making.



Purpose



This policy is intended to ensure that public participation is an integral and effective part of Departmental activities
and that decisions are made with the benefit of important public perspectives. This policy provides a mechanism for
bringing a broad range of diverse stakeholder viewpoints and values early into the Department's decision-making
process. This early involvement enables the Department to make more informed decisions, improve quality through
collaborative efforts, and build mutual understanding and trust between the Department and the public it serves.




Scope



This policy is designed to function as a general framework within which all Department programs shall operate. While
it applies to all levels of DOE, its intent is development and implementation of effective public participation programs
at each site. In conjunction with its stakeholders and field manager, each site shall develop and implement a public
participation program that promotes openness and two-way communication and is tailored to meet specific program,
site, and stakeholder needs. This policy is not intended to affect legal requirements imposed by law, regulation,
or contractual agreement; neither does it modify any legal rights available to the public under current law.



Definitions



Under this policy, the Department actively seeks, considers, and incorporates or otherwise responds in a timely
manner to the views of its stakeholders thereby providing them an opportunity to influence decisions. Stakeholders
are defined as those individuals and groups in the public and private sectors who are interested in and/or affected
by the Department's activities and decisions. Public participation is defined as open, ongoing two-way communication,
both formal and informal, within the DOE Complex and between the Department and its stakeholders. This communication
will vary widely in nature and scope and may include, but is not limited to, informal conversations, scheduled meetings
and workshops, legally required hearings, and Federal-State-local-Tribal agreements. 



Goals



The goals of the Department's Public Participation Policy are:

I. The Department actively seeks and considers public input, and incorporates or otherwise responds to the views
of its stakeholders in making its decisions. 

II. The public is informed in a timely manner about and empowered to participate in the Department's decision-making
processes, which are open, understandable, and consistently followed. Access points for public input are clearly
defined from the earliest stages of a decision process and provide adequate time for stakeholders to participate.

III. Credible, effective public participation processes are consistently incorporated into the Department's
program operations, planning activities, and decision-making processes, at headquarters and in the field. Every
employee within the DOE Complex shares responsibility to promote, practice, and improve public participation.




Core Values



Though program-specific public participation activities may vary throughout the DOE Complex, each program will
be characterized by the following core values:



Accessibility: 

Known avenues to Department leaders who are available, approachable, and open to the public. 



Accountability: 

Responsibility to the public for its decisions and a willingness to provide explanations for the rationales behind
its decisions.



Accuracy: 

Commitment to the truth.



Communication: 

Open, two-way exchange of information, knowledge, and perspectives between the Department and its stakeholders.



Consistency: 

Stakeholder interactions marked by regularity and continuity.



Fairness: 

Objectivity and freedom from favor toward any side.



Honesty: 

Commitment to fairness, trustworthiness, and straightforwardness.



Innovation: 

Introduction of new ideas, methods, and approaches.



Openness: 

Ready accessibility and a willingness to listen to, consider, and respond to stakeholders.



Peer review: 

Reexamination of key issues and decisions by internal and external peers.

Respect: 

Consideration and deference in the treatment of stakeholders.


Responsiveness: 

Timely and empathetic consideration of and response to the needs, wants, and concerns of stakeholders.


Scientific Credibility: 

Commitment to the pursuit of sound, dependable, leading edge science.


Sincerity: 

Openness, frankness, and truthfulness in all stakeholder communications.


Time/Timeliness: 

Adequate amount of time for stakeholders to participate in Department decision-making processes. Timely responses
to stakeholder input and requests. Timely Departmental decision-making processes supported but not hindered or
delayed by public participation.


Accountability


Senior departmental, program, and field managers are accountable for assuring that public participation activities
meet the goals of this policy and the needs of stakeholders; are fully coordinated; and reflect Departmental principles
and values. Managers are responsible for implementing plans that assure that public participation needs for their
programs or projects are identified and satisfied in the decision-making process. Public Participation is a performance
element for these managers.


Guidance On Implementation of the Department's Public Participation Policy


Public participation must be a fundamental component of the Department's program operations, planning activities,
and decision-making. The business of the Department must be open to the full view and input of those whom it serves,
consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and contracts.
To ensure that we operate in this manner, the Department's Public Participation Policy was developed by a cross-cutting
team that included field representatives. This policy marks a clear break with past practice by challenging the Department
and its contractors to perform to a new standard of openness and service.
Witin this policy framework, each site will develop its own public participation program and plan in consultation
with stakeholders and with the concurrence of appropriate Headquarters program offices. In achieving the goals
of public participation, managers are responsible for:
 identifying, planning, funding, supporting, and implementing the appropriate level and scope of public
participation activities in their programs;
 ensuring that public participation principles, values, and processes are fully understood and practiced
within their programs and at their sites;
 providing necessary human, information, systems, and financial resources; and,
 ensuring that their staff receive basic communication and public participation training, and where appropriate,
advanced public participation training.
To promote teamwork, share the benefits of experience and innovation at individual sites, and avoid unreasonable
demands on site personnel or stakeholders, program and staff offices will coordinate public participation activities
through the Office of Public and Consumer Affairs at Headquarters or with its counterpart in the field. This coordination
in no way limits or dilutes field managers' authority to implement effective public participation programs or program
managers' responsibility to plan, fund, and support appropriate levels of public participation in their programs.
The effectiveness with which each site/program implements the Department's Public Participation Policy will be
assessed annually, and these assessments must include the views and recommendations of stakeholders. Stakeholders
will also be invited to participate in the processes used to develop critieria and measures for judging effectiveness.
The Director of Public and Consumer Affairs will evaluate these annual assessments and recommend changes to improve
the effectiveness of the Department's public participation efforts.
While public participation processes must be tailored to meet specific site, program, and stakeholder needs, the
following broad guidance provides a framework to assist management in implementing this policy Department-wide.
Using the following critical policy elements and implementing actions as a guide, Headquarters and Field Elements
should consult with stakeholders to develop appropriate public participation programs and activities.


Critical Policy Elements


I


The Department recognizes that honesty and forthrightness in dealing with stakeholders, and consistent, credible,
quality performance are the bases upon which to build public understanding and trust.


Implementing Actions:


 Department officials will be open, honest, and accurate in their public statements and accountable for diligent
follow-up and timely results from the commitment they make.
 Department officials will engage in an open and on-going communication process and consistently listen and
respond to suggestions made by the public. The Department will incorporate public input into its decisions where
appropriate and feasible and will provide feedback to the public on its reasoning.
 Department officials will recognize and reward leadership and results in the area of public participation.


II


Departmental program development, planning, and decision-making processes will be clearly defined, with regular,
easily identified access points for public input.


Implementing actions:


 Senior management will ensure that Department personnel, other Federal, State, and local officials, Tribes,
and other stakeholders are appropriately integrated into their planning activities and decision-making processes.

<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Stakeholders and field managers will determine and identify pre-decisional access points for public input.



III



Headquarters, field offices, laboratories, and facilities will operate as an integrated team in planning local
and national public participation programs by combining resources, sharing information, and coordinating activities.



Implementing actions:

 Headquarters Elements will coordinate their planning of public participation activities with the Office
of Public and Consumer Affairs and with affected sites, including the site Public Affairs/ External Relations director.
 Field managers, as those closest to affected communities and stakeholders, will facilitate accommodation
between local and national interests.




IV

ACTION: 

Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection
and its expected cost and burden; where appropriate, it includes the actual data collection instrument.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Office of Water





Title: 

Facility and Well Inventory Information for the UIC Program. (EPA ICR No:370.12) this ICR requests approval of an
amendment to an existing information collection activity.



Abstract: 

EPA will reinstate the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form which will be used by all 36 Primacy States and each of
the ten Regions to collect and maintain inventory information for each newly permitted and rule-authorized injection
well within its jurisdiction. Under Section 1445 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), persons subject to the Underground
Injection Control (UIC) program must: ``establish and maintain such records, make such reports, conduct such monitoring,
and provide such information as the Administrator may reasonably require by regulation to assist her in establishing
regulations under this title * * *.'' The specific UIC program requirements applicable to reinstating
the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form are codified at 40 CFR part 144_Underground Injection Control Program,
and 40 CFR part 145_State UIC Program Requirements.

The Inventory of Injection Wells information is entered on a one page form that has six areas of information: the first
five sections are concerned with facility identifier information such as name and location, facility ID number,
transaction type, geographical coordinates, and legal contact person. The sixth form area gathers information
on well class and type, number of wells and operational status.

Regional and Headquarters' staff will use the inventory information collected from this form to make decisions on
resources and funding for State and Regional UIC programs, levels of enforcement activity, and strategic and policy
issues related to UIC program objectives. Primacy States (where primary enforcement responsibility is vested in
States that have EPA-approved UIC programs) will also use the injection well and facility information to target field
inspections and enforcement activity and to track well performance. In addition, Primacy States and Regions can
use the summary reports they supply to EPA Headquarters to evaluate their own program activities, such as the number
and operating characteristics of injection wells within their jurisdiction.

Information on this form is completed by the Primacy State or the Region, using information available either from
inspection reports, the facility's permit file, or (in instances where the facility is rule authorized) from its
existing inventory file. The UIC well operator is 

not 

required to submit any additional information as a result of this information collection request, and therefore,
will not incur any of the burden. The existing UIC Program ICR, which is approved by OMB through March, 1995, (OMB

#

 2040-0042) includes the burden and cost incurred by well operators complying with 40 CFR 144.26 and applying
for either permits or rule-authorized status. This ICR under review details only the information and burden required
as a result of reinstating the ``Inventory of Injection Wells'' form.

Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average approximately
one half hour per response per year. This includes time for reading the instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the needed data and completing the inventory form.

Respondents: 36 Primacy States_SIC 951 (government environmental protection agencies).

Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent: 813.

Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 14,600 hours.

Frequency of Collection: annually.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (Mail Code: 2136), 401 M Street,

Notice of Intent to Award A Grant with Time Constraints


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award
of a grant with time constraints to the American Drug Development, Inc. (ADD). The purpose of the grant is to provide
the orphan drug, Sodium Phenylbutyrate, to children with three urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamyl phosphate
synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and argininosuccinic acid synthetase) which, if not treated, are
fatal to the patient. Competition is limited to ADD because ADD is the entity currently able to manufacture and supply
Sodium Phenylbutyrate for the treatment of these disorders. ADD is also in the process of compiling documentation
which will be submitted to FDA for approval of a new drug application (NDA) for Sodium Phenylbutyrate. Until the NDA
is approved, this drug is not available to patients by any other means other than through a grant to ADD.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award of a grant with time constraints
to ADD, Baltimore, MD. FDA's authority to enter into grants for the development of drugs for rare diseases and conditions
is set out in Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee). FDA's research program is described in the Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance No. 93.103. Before entering into grants, FDA carefully considers the benefits that
such grants will provide to the public.


ADD's application will undergo a peer review in accordance with the Public Health Service policies and procedures
governing the review of grant applications with time constraints.


I. Background 


For the past 8 years, FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development (OPD) has funded a clinical research grant for the
treatment of urea cycle disorders with Sodium Phenylbutyrate. This grant expires September 30, 1994. Due to the life-threatening
nature of urea cycle disorders, it is necessary to have a 3-month supply of the drug on hand in case possible problems
in the purity and/or availability of the drug arise. For this reason, more drugs must be ordered by September 15, 1994,
to ensure an adequate drug supply. ADD is able to immediately manufacture and supply the drug for the treatment of these
disorders.


II. Mechanism of Support


A. Award Instrument


Support will be in the form of a grant. In 1994, the FDA estimate for this grant award is $ 750,000 (final amount will be
negotiated). The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that govern the research grant programs of
the Public Health Service (PHS), including the provision of 42 CFR part 52, 45 CFR part 74, and the PHS grants policy
statement.


B. Length of Support


The length of support may be for 24 months with no possibility of additional noncompetitive support. 


III. Reasons for Award With Time Constraints


FDA believes that there is a compelling need to award a grant to ADD based on time constraints because these urea cycle
disorders are fatal if untreated. Also, FDA believes that ADD is uniquely qualified to fulfill the objectives of the
proposed grant because it is able to immediately manufacture and supply Sodium Phenylbutyrate.


IV. Reporting Requirements


Program progress reports and financial status reports will be required annually, based on the date of award. These
reports will be due within 30 days after the end of the budget period. A final program progress report and financial
status report will be due 90 days after expiration of the project period of the grant.


V. Smoke-Free Workplace


PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people.

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Effexor

 

</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Effexor

 

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.



A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
 
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Effexor

 

 (venlafaxine hydrochloride). Effexor

 

 is indicated for the treatment of depression. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received
a patent term restoration application for Effexor

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,535,186) from American Home Products Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994,
FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Effexor

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the products's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Effexor

 

 is 2,959 days. Of this time, 1,981 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 978
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: November 23, 1985. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that November 23, 1985, was the date the investigational
new drug application (IND) became effective. 2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:

 April 26, 1991. The applicant claims June 18, 1991, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Effexor

 

 (NDA 20-151) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that NDA 20-151 was initailly submitted
on April 26, 1991.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: December 28, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-151 was approved on December 28, 1993.

This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the
applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition
must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

therapy, including high-dose cisplatin. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received
a patent term restoration application for Kytril

TM

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,886,808) from Beecham Group p.l.c., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994, FDA advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the
approval of Kytril

TM

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Kytril

TM

 is 1,996 days. Of this time, 1,371 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 625
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
 
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective:

 July 14, 1988. The applicant claims July 9, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became
effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was July 14, 1988, which was 30 days after FDA's
receipt of the IND.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:

 April 14, 1992. The applicant claims April 10, 1992, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Kytril

TM

 (NDA 20-239) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that the NDA was initially submitted on
April 14, 1992. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: December 29, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-239 was approved on December 29, 1993.

This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 382 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Lipidil

 

</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Lipidil

 

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Lipidil

 

 (fenofibrate). Lipidil

 

 is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride
levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who are at risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined
dietary effort to control them. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term
restoration application for Lipidil

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,739,101) from Fournier Innovation et Synergie, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested
FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 19,
1994, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Lipidil

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Lipidil

 

 is 4,501 days. Of this time, 1,003 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 3,498
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: September 6, 1981. The applicant claims August 16, 1981, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was September 6, 1981, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: June 4, 1984. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that June 4, 1984, was the date the new drug application (NDA)
for Lipidil

 

 (NDA 19-304) was initially submitted.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: December 31, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 19-304 was approved on December 31, 1993.

This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 2 years and 256 days of
patent term extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions

FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Livostin

 

 (levocabastine hydrochloride). Livostin

 

 is indicated for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Subsequent
to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Livostin

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,369,184) from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's

FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Livostin

 

 is 2,779 days. Of this time, 2,000 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 779
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
 
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: April 4, 1986. The applicant claims April 5, 1986, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became

receipt of the IND.

2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual

 is 1,940 days. Of this time, 1,316 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 624
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective: 

September 8, 1988. Applicant claims September 7, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was September 8, 1988, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:

 April 15, 1992. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that April 15, 1992, was the date the new drug application (NDA)
for Risperdal

 

 (NDA 20-272) was initially submitted.
3. 

The date the application was approved:

 December 29, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-272 was approved on December 29, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 683 days of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the
applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition
must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Zosyn

 

</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Zosyn

 

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Zosyn

 

 (tazobactam sodium and piperacillin sodium). Zosyn

 

 is indicated as for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe infections caused by piperacillin resistant,
piperacillin/tazobactam susceptible, 

b

-lactamase producing strains of the designated microorganisms in certain specified conditions. Subsequent to
this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Zosyn

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,562,073) from Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 19, 1994,
FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Zosyn

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Zosyn

 

 is 1,819 days. Of this time, 1,038 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 781
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: October 31, 1988. The applicant claims July 10, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
for Zosyn

 

 (IND 31,705) became effective. However, IND 31,705 was received on June 14, 1988, and it was placed on clinical hold
on July 1, 1988. It was removed from clinical hold on October 31, 1988, making the IND effective date October 31, 1988.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 507 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: September 3, 1991. The applicant claims August 30, 1991, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Zosyn

 

 (NDA 50-684) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that NDA 50-684 was submitted on
September 3, 1991. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: October 22, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 50-684 was approved on October 22, 1993. 
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,358 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Final Funding Preferences for Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final funding preferences for fiscal year
(FY) 1994 for the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program authorized under the authority of section
737 of the Public Health Service Act (the Act), title VII, Part B, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension
Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 



Purpose 



The SDS program is a program of grants to health professions and nursing schools for the purpose of assisting such schools
in providing scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who are enrolled (or accepted for enrollment)
as full-time students in the schools, as well as to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing
a career in health professions. 



Statutory Preference 



The law requires that in providing SDS scholarships, the school give preference to students who are from disadvantaged
backgrounds and for whom the cost of attending an SDS school would constitute a severe financial hardship. Severe
financial hardship will be determined by the school in accordance with standard need analysis procedures prescribed
by the Department of Education for its Federal student aid programs. 



Final Funding Preference 



A proposed funding preference was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 20, 1994, at 59 FR 31643, for public comment. Three comments were received during the 30-day comment period
which were in support of the proposed funding preference. One commentor called attention to congressional report
language which directs the Department to give highest priority, among allied health applicants, to dental hygiene
programs. 

In accord with the Congress' directive, the final funding preference will be revised as follows: 

For fiscal year 1994, among allied health schools or programs, preference will be given to the following baccalaureate
and graduate programs: dental hygiene, medical laboratory technology, occupational therapy, physical therapy
and radiologic technology. The priority for dental hygiene will be implemented by taking the total funds allocated
to the allied health disciplines in the initial allocation and recalculating this part of the allocation. Dental
hygiene schools will receive double credit for their disadvantaged enrollments in the reallocation of the allied
health funds. 



Additional Information 



Programmatic questions should be directed to: Mr. Bruce Baggett, Chief, Student and Institutional Support Branch,
Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn
Building, Room 8-34, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857, Telephone: (301) 443-4776, FAX:
(301) 594-6911.

The 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 

Number for the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students program is 93.925. This program is not subject to the provisions
of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented through 45 CFR part 100).


This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 108 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act as amended by Public Law 100-713 and 102-573, authorized
the IHS Loan Repayment Program and provide in pertinent part as follows:




The Secretary, acting through the Service, shall establish a program to be known as the Indian Health Service Loan
Repayment Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Loan Repayment Program'') in order to assure an adequate supply
of trained health professionals necessary to maintain accreditation of, and provide health care services to Indians
through, Indian health programs.
``Health Professional'' means family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, geriatric medicine, obstetrics
and gynecology, podiatric medicine, nursing, public health nursing, dentistry, psychiatry, osteopathy, optometry,
pharmacy, psychology, public health, social work, marriage and family therapy, chiropractic medicine, environmental
health and engineering and allied health professionals.




Osteopathic physicians (D.O.) may be funded regardless of specialty, provided that the IHS has a need for that specialty.
Allopathic physicians (M.D.) may be funded only if they are board certified/eligible in family medicine, internal
medicine, pediatrics, geriatric medicine, obstetrics and gynecology and psychiatry.
For the purposes of this program, the term ``Indian health program'' is defined in Section 108(a)(2)(A), as follows:




. . . any health program or facility funded, in whole or in part, by the IHS for the benefit of American
Indians and Alaska Natives and administered:


a. Directly by the service; or
b. By any Indian tribe or tribal or Indian organization pursuant to a contract under:
(1) The Indian Self-Determination Act; or
(2) Section 23 of the Act of April 30, 1908, (25 U.S.C. 47), popularly known as the Buy Indian Act; or
(3) By an urban Indian organization pursuant to Title V of this act.




Applicants may sign contractual agreements with the Secretary for 2 years. The IHS will repay all or a portion of the
applicant's health professionals educational loans (undergraduate and graduate) for tuition expenses and reasonable
educational and living expenses in amounts up to $30,000 per year for each year of contracted service to be made in annual
payments to the participant for the purpose of repaying his/her outstanding health professions educational loans.
Repayment of health professions educations loans will be made to the participant within 120 days after the participant's
entry on duty has been confirmed by the IHS. The Secretary must approve the contract before the disbursement of loan
repayments can be made to the participant.

Participants will be required to fulfill their contract service agreements through full-time clinical practice
at an Indian health program site determined by the Secretary. Loan repayment sites are characterized by physical,
cultural, and professional isolation, and have histories of frequent staff turnover. All Indian health program
sites are annually prioritized by discipline, based on need or vacancy by the Agency. 

All health professionals will receive up to $30,000 per year, regardless of their length of contract. Where payments
under the Loan Repayment Program result in an increase in Federal income tax liability, the IHS will pay up to 31 percent
of the participant's total loan repayments to the Internal Revenue Service on the participant's behalf for all or
part of the increased tax liability of the participant. 

Pursuant to Section 108(b), to be eligible to participate in the Loan Repayment Program an individual must: 

(1) A. Be enrolled: (i) In a course of study or program in an accredited institution, as determined by the Secretary,
within any state and be scheduled to complete such course of study in the same year such individual applies to participate
in the Loan Repayment Program. (The term ``State'' includes, in addition to the several States, only the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, The Virgin Islands,
Guam, America Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of
Palau); or 

(ii) In an approved graduate training program in a health profession; or 

B. Have a degree in a health profession and a license to practice; and 

(2) A. be eligible for, or hold an appointment as a Commissioned Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public
Health Service, or 

B. Be eligible for selection for civilian service in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service; or 

C. Meet the professional standards for civil service employment in the IHS; or 


D. Be employed in an Indian health program without service obligation; and 

(3) Submit to the Secretary an application and contract to the Loan Repayment Program; and 

(4) Sign and submit to the Secretary, a written contract agreeing to accept repayment of educational loans and to serve
for the applicable period of obligated service in a priority site as determined by the Secretary; and 

(5) Sign an affidavit attesting to the fact that they have been informed of the relative merits of the U.S. Public Health
Service Commissioned Corps and the Civil Service as employment options. 

Upon approval of the applicant for participation in the Loan Repayment Program, the applicant will receive confirmation
of his/her loan repayment award and the duty site at which he/she will serve his/her loan repayment obligation. 

The IHS has identified the positions in each Indian health program for which there is a need or vacancy and ranked those
positions in order of priority by developing discipline specific prioritized lists of sites. Ranking criteria for
these sites include the following: 

 Historically critical shortages caused by frequent staff turnover 

 Current unmatched vacancies in a Health Profession Discipline 

 Projected Vacancies in a Health Profession Discipline 

 Ensuring that the staffing needs of Indian health programs administered by an Indian tribe or tribal or health organization
receive consideration on an equal basis with programs that are administered directly by the Service; and 

 Giving priority to vacancies in Indian health programs that have a need for health professionals to provide health
care services as a result of individuals having breached Loan Repayment Program contracts entered into under this
section.

<TEXT>
 

Consistent with this priority ranking, in determining which applications to approve and which contracts to accept,
the IHS will give priority to applications made by American Indians and Alaska Natives and to individuals recruited
through the efforts of Indian tribes or tribal or Indian organizations.
 With respect to priorities among the various health professions, the statute requires that of the total amount
appropriated for Fiscal Year 1995 for loan repayment contracts, not less than 25 percent be provided to applicants
who are nurses, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives and not less than 10 percent be provided to applicants who are
mental health professionals (other than nurses, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives). This requirement does
not apply if the number of applications from these two groups, respectively, is not sufficient to meet the requirement.
 Subject to the above statutory priority for nurses and mental health practitioners, the IHS will give priority
in funding among health professionals to physicians in the following priority specialties: anesthesiology, emergency
room medicine, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology/otorhinolaryngology,
psychiatry and radiology.
The following factors are equal in weight when applied, and are applied when all other criteria are equal and a selection
must be made between applicants. One or all of the following factors may be applicable to an applicant, and the applicant
who has the most of these factors, all other criteria equal, would be selected.
 An applicant's length of current employment in the IHS, tribal or urban program.
 Availability for service earlier than other applicants (first come, first served); and
 Date the individual's application was received.
Any individual who enters this program and satisfactorily completes his or her obligated period of service may apply
to extend the contract on a year-by-year basis as determined by the IHS, at the maximum amount of up to $30,000 per year
and additional 31 percent for Federal Withholding. If funds are available, the maximum amount will be funded in this
manner and will not exceed the total of the individual's outstanding eligible health professions educational loans.
Any individual who owes an obligation for health professional service to the Federal Government or to a State or other
entity under an agreement with such State or other entity is not eligible for the Loan Repayment Program unless such
an obligation will be completely satisfied prior to the beginning of service under this program in the year that an
application is made for this program.
This program is not subject to review under Executive Order 12372.
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 13.164.

Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of funds and request for applications.




* It is important to note that applications are invited based on the funding levels proposed in the President's
budget for fiscal year 1995. However, this RFA is being announced prior to an appropriation of funds in order to allow
applicants sufficient time to establish collaboration and coordination and prepare applications. Solicitation
of applications in advance of an appropriation will also enable the award of appropriated grant funds in the most expeditious
manner and allow prompt implementation and evaluation of promising employment intervention programs for adults
with severe mental illnesses. 

All applicants should understand, however, that final appropriation action will be necessary in order for CMHS to
fund any applications. 

Questions regarding the status of the appropriation of funds should be directed to the program official listed under
Contacts for Additional Information in this notice.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) announces the availability of demonstration grants to document the
effectiveness of programs designed to enhance competitive employment for adults with severe mental illnesses.
Funds will be awarded through the Community Support Program (CSP) of the Division of Demonstration Programs of CMHS.
This request for applications (RFA) solicits applications for two types of awards:


Demonstration Sites and a Coordinating Center.


This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: the enhancement of competitive employment
for adults with severe mental illnesses. A collaborative, multisite approach is essential to test the effectiveness
of different employment interventions and synthesize the intervention results. Because of the complexity of the
program, requiring substantial programmatic involvement of CMHS staff to facilitate communication and coordination
across projects, the cooperative agreement mechanism is being used.
This notice consists of three parts:


Part I 

covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to the Community
Support Program: Cooperative Agreements for Employment Intervention Demonstration Program.


Part II 

describes the target population, the issue, and the programmatic goal and discusses eligibility, availability
of funds, period of support and the receipt date for applications.


Part III 

describes special requirements of the program, the application process, the review and award criteria and lists
contacts for additional information.


Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies


Cooperative agreements awarded under this RFA are authorized under Section 520A of the Public Health Service Act,
as amended (42 U.S.C. 290bb-32).
Federal regulations at Title 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92, generic requirements concerning the administration of grants,
are applicable to these awards.
Grants must be administered in accordance with the 

PHS Grants Policy Statement 

dated April 1, 1994 (DHHS Publication No. (OASH) 94-50,000 (Rev)). This policy statement is effective for all
grants with budget periods beginning on or after April 1, 1994. It also reflects policies with earlier effective dates.
This document supersedes the PHS Grants Policy Statement dated October 1, 1990, as updated September 1, 1991.
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 93.125.


Reporting Requirements: 

Interim and final progress reports and financial status reports will be required and specified to awardees in accord
with PHS Grants Policy requirements.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of 

Healthy People 2000

1

, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This RFA, ``Employment Intervention Demonstration Program,''
is related to the objectives set forth in Chapter 6, Mental Health and Mental Disorders, in 

Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives.

 




Part II_Target Population, Issue and the Programmatic Goal and Project Requirements and Activities, Eligibility
and Application Receipt Date




Purpose:

 The goal of this RFA is the generation of knowledge about effective approaches for enhancing competitive employment
for adults with severe mental illnesses through support for the implementation and evaluation of promising employment
intervention programs. Applications are being solicited for Demonstration Sites to conduct a multisite, cooperative
study of employment interventions to enhance competitive employment. Applications are also being sought for a Coordinating
Center to provide overall coordination and data management and to carry out the common protocol which will be developed.



Target Population:

 The population of concern for CSP grants includes individuals 18 years and older with severe mental illnesses (including,
but not limited to, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, mood disorders, and severe personality disorders)
that substantially interfere with a person's ability to carry out such primary aspects of daily living as self-care,
household management, interpersonal relationships, and work or school. 


Statement of Issue:

 Rehabilitation is an essential component of care for adults with severe mental illnesses. In order to enhance independent
living as fully as possible, rehabilitation services need to include appropriate vocational rehabilitation, which
may include: assessment of potential for employment, training, job placement, continuing support, and reasonable
accommodations at the work site. In addition to providing remuneration and social contacts, employment may promote
improvements in self esteem, independence, community integration, and self-management of illness. People with
psychiatric disabilities are the second largest group of applicants for vocational rehabilitation services and
have the lowest rate of success. Even with high client motivation and the support of families, rates of employment
for this population are very low, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent. 
Special attention should be focused on persons from ethnic minority communities who are over-represented in the
adult severe mental illness population. With involvement of these community members at each stage of design, implementation
and evaluation, culturally competent interventions can be successful. 


Program Goal:

 This demonstration program addresses a priority mental health need: competitive employment in integrated settings
for adults with severe mental illnesses. Competitive employment is defined as a paid position which is open to anyone
and pays at least minimum wages. Employment may include positions in a mental health system as long as the positions
are not restricted to adults with diagnoses of severe mental illnesses. On-site and/or off-site long-term supports
may be utilized. Because there is a need for systematically bringing together information concerning employment
intervention programs, CMHS is initiating this program to determine the effectiveness of interventions. Findings
concerning the most effective approaches and the associated direct costs are needed by policy makers and program
planners. 
This program of study is focussed on employment interventions which will lead to competitive employment. The goal
of the intervention, which may include vocational training and environmental accommodations, must be competitive
employment in mainstream (not sheltered) work environments. Outcome measures may include, but are not limited to,
days of paid employment within a specified time interval, level of social and occupational functioning, and consumer
and employer satisfaction.

2

 Effective employment interventions are an integral part of a community support system and, therefore, are expected
to be integrated with other services as appropriate.

The goals of this program address the themes of the Secretary of HHS: fostering independence through empowering people
served; preventing future problems; and improving services to customers through modern management approaches.

Demonstration Site applicants will develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention with the goal of improving
competitive employment. This multisite, cooperative agreement will also develop a common study protocol. After
grantees are selected for funding, grantees and CMHS staff will identify issues and study questions which can be examined
by utilizing the data elements in common across the Demonstration Sites. The utilization of agreed-upon measures
which are in common across Demonstration Sites provides the opportunity to compare intervention effects for different
populations in different geographic locations, thereby enhancing the generalizability of results, and allows
for statistical analyses that assess the effects of multiple factors on employment status outcomes. 
Progress in employment is often characterized by episodes of productive employment followed by unemployment. Therefore,
a long-term perspective is needed to appropriately assess outcomes of an intervention. Successful applicants for
this program of study will include data collection over a period of at least 2 years, and a longer time interval for data
collection is encouraged. 
The primary goal of this RFA is the determination of the effectiveness of interventions. However, information on
costs will be valuable in informing policy decisions for resource allocations. Effectiveness is defined as the improvement
of positive outcomes and the reduction of adverse outcomes, regardless of costs. An important component in studying
the value of an intervention is the determination of the costs of the intervention. Because this is an initial exploration
of costs, the focus will be limited to actual direct expenditures for employment intervention programs and employment
site activities. Costs unique to the evaluation component will not be included in the analyses. Cost information
from this demonstration program may provide the basis for future studies of cost effectiveness that would likely
be expanded to incorporate financial costs, indirect costs, and lost-opportunity costs. 


Structure and Phases of the MultiSite Program: 

The study will involve the cooperation of personnel from (1) a Coordinating Center, (2) the Demonstration Sites,
and (3) the CMHS staff. 
Awards will be made for a project period of up to 5 years. For planning and budgeting purposes, the study can be envisioned
as proceeding in the following three phases.

 

Phase I: Development of a collaborative study plan (common protocol); development, refinement, and pilot testing
of common methodological procedures and instruments (baseline and outcome); training in the common field procedures;
examination of validity of proposed instruments and development of a centralized database and coordinating structure,
intervention start up (months 1-6); 
Phase II: Full implementation of service programs, identification and enrollment of clients; ongoing data collection
and evaluation activities; interim data analyses (months 6-30); 
Phase III: Phase-down of intervention programs; end enrollment of clients in the study; complete follow-up data
collection for enrolled clients; conduct data analyses and produce reports and publications (months 30-60).

 



Role of Demonstration Sites: 

Each Demonstration Site grantee, in collaboration with the Federal staff and the Coordinating Center, will have
responsibility at their own site for service program planning and implementation, client enrollment and follow
up, data collection, preliminary and final data analysis and interpretation, quality control, and preparation
of reports and publications. In addition, each Demonstration Site grantee will participate in the development and
activities of the common protocol including providing data to the Coordinating Center. 


Role of the Coordinating Center: 

For the common protocol which will be developed in the planning phase, the Coordinating Center will provide overall
study coordination, including data management and analysis, training in common procedures, distribution of common
materials to all study sites, monitoring of data quality and analysis of cost data collected by the Demonstration
Sites. The Coordinating Center will also coordinate the pilot testing of the common core instruments, as agreed upon
in the planning phase. CMHS staff will work with and monitor the Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center will
develop and maintain a common data repository, containing those data elements collected by each Demonstration Site
which will be used in the common protocol. 


Role of CMHS Staff: 

CMHS staff will be active participants in all aspects of the cooperative agreements and will serve as collaborators
with project directors from the Demonstration Sites and the Coordinating Center. CMHS staff have overall responsibility
for monitoring the conduct and progress of this program and will make recommendations regarding continuance of the
program. CMHS staff will provide substantial input, in collaboration with the grantees, both in the planning and
conduct of this program. 


Role of the Steering Committee: 

The Steering Committee will be composed of the project director of the Coordinating Center, the project directors
from each of the Demonstration Sites, and CMHS staff. In addition, for Demonstration Sites where the State mental
health authority is not the direct applicant, the State mental health authority will be invited to be a participant
as a voting member of the committee. 
All participating grantees will agree to abide by the common protocol study design and policy recommendations developed
by the Steering Committee and any required CMHS approvals set forth in the terms and conditions of this cooperative
agreement.

Eligibility:

 Eligible applicants include States, political subdivisions of states and nonprofit private agencies. Therefore,
State mental health authorities, as well as one or more of public organizations in a State, such as units of State and
local governments, and nonprofit organizations such as community-based organizations, universities, colleges
and hospitals may be direct applicants. 
Entities may apply for either and/or both types of awards (Demonstration Site and/or Coordination Center). 


Availability of Funds:

 It is estimated that approximately $2.3 million will be available to support approximately four to five awards to
Demonstration Sites and a Coordinating Center under this RFA in FY 95. For each of the 5 years, an average of approximately
$300,000 per year will be available for the Coordinating Center and an average of $400,000 to $500,000 for each of the
Demonstration Sites for each year. It is anticipated that in years one and five, funding of the Coordinating Center
will be higher than in years two through four. Funding for Demonstration Sites will be lower in years one and five, and
higher in years two through four. Actual funding levels will depend upon the availability of appropriated funds.




(

Note:

 CMHS is required by the Public Health Service Act to make available 15 percent of the funds appropriated under Section
520A for projects in rural areas.)

 



Period of Support:

 Support may be requested for a period of up to 5 years. Annual awards will be made subject to continued availability
of funds and progress achieved.

programs in its award decision-making process. (Please see Award Criteria section.) A list of Federal programs that
applicants may coordinate with is included in the Application kit.


Single State Agency Coordination:

 Coordination with the Single State Agency (SSA) for mental health is encouraged to ensure communication, reduce
duplication, and facilitate continuity. Therefore applicants who are not State mental health authorities must
include a copy of a letter sent to the SSA briefly describing the grant application. A list of SSAs can be found in the
grant application kit. If the target population falls within the jurisdiction of more than one State, all representative
SSAs should be involved.


Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372):

 Applications submitted in response to this announcement are subject to the intergovernmental review requirements
of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for
State and local government review of applications for Federal financial assistance. Applicants (other than federally
recognized Indian Tribal Authorities) should contact the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible
to alert them to the prospective application(s) and to receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For
proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State.
A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit. The SPOC should send any State process recommendations
to the following address: Barbara Silver, PhD, Acting Director, Office of Extramural Policy and Review, Center for
Mental Health Services, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 18C-07, Rockville, MD 20857, Attn: SPOC.
The due date for State process recommendations is 

no later than 60 days

Public Health System Reporting Requirements:

 This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. 



Promoting Nonuse of Tobacco:

 Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for
the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National
Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths
per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged
exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. 

Consistent with its mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people, it is the
policy of PHS to strongly encourage all recipients of the PHS grants to provide a smoke-free work place and promote
the nonuse of tobacco products. It is also the policy of PHS to encourage those recipients which already have a smoke-free
work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products to continue such practices. Particular attention should be
given to avoiding exposure to secondary smoke by pregnant women and children. Additionally, CMHS strongly encourages
all cooperative agreement applicants to implement policies and activities that promote the nonuse of tobacco products
by clients/patients as a goal of treatment. 



Application Procedures:

 Completely separate applications must be submitted for Demonstration Sites and for the Coordinating Center. 

All applicants must use application form PHS 5161-1 (Rev. 7/92), which contains Standard Form 424 (face page).
Grant application kits (including form PHS 5161-1 with Standard Form 424, complete application procedures,
and accompanying guidance materials for the narrative approved under OMB No. 0937-0189) may be obtained from:
Community Support Program, Center for Mental Health Services, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 11C-22, Rockville,
MD 20857, 301/443-3653.



Applicants must submit:

 (1) an original copy signed by the authorized official of the applicant organization, with the appropriate appendices;
and (2) two additional, legible copies of the application and all appendices to the Division of Research Grants, NIH.
Center for Mental Health Services Programs, Division of Research Grants, NIH, Westwood Building, Room 240, 5333
Westbard Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland 20892*.







Review Process:

 Applications submitted in response to this RFA will be reviewed for technical merit in accordance with established
PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants. 

Applications that are accepted for review will be assigned to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of
non-Federal experts. Notification of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the
initial review. In addition, the IRG recommendations on technical merit of applications will undergo a second level
of review by the appropriate advisory council whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical
merit. Applications may be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation
for approval. 

Review Criteria for Demonstration Site Applications: The points noted in the parentheses for each criterion indicate
the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign to that criterion. These points will be used to calculate a raw
score for each application. The raw score will be converted to the official priority score.

<DOCTITLE>Temporary Travel Restrictions for the Fly Creek Area of Colorado.</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Little Snake Resource Area, Bureau of Land Management, DOI.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Order of area, road and trail use restriction.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This order closes certain public lands to motorized vehicle use in the Fly Creek planning area in the Little Snake Resource
Area, Craig District, with two exceptions: (1) Snowmobiles and (2) motorized vehicles (excluding All-Terrain Vehicles
[ATVs] and motorcycles) on the designated route adjacent to Fly Creek. This order modifies the existing Off-Highway
Vehicle (OHV) use ``Open'' designation on approximately 12,180 acres of public land in this area. This order is issued
under the authority of 43 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 8364.1 and 43 CFR 8341.2(a) as a temporary measure while
the off-highway vehicle (OHV) management portion of the Little Snake Resource Area, Resource Management Plan is
reviewed and modified as needed to address public issues, concerns and needs, as well as resource uses, development,
impacts and protection.



All motorized vehicle use, with the exception of snowmobiles, will be limited to the designated route along Fly Creek
on BLM public lands. In addition, the operation of ATVs, motorcylces and similar types of vehicles will be prohibited
on the designated route. Authorized motor vehicle access on the designated route will terminate on BLM public land,
approximately 2.5 miles south of Routt County Road 

#

129, in T. 12 N., R. 88 W., Section 30, S1/2S1/2. Motorized vehicle use by the public will not be allowed on the designated
route until construction and mitigation is adequate to accommodate this use.

The route and terminus will be marked with appropriate signing. The restrictions apply to all users except those listed
as exempt under supplementary information herewithin.

This order affects public lands in Moffat County thus described:

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Current OHV use designations for public lands in the area, established in the Little Snake Resource Area Resource
Management Plan, 1989, allow motorized vehicle use on and off the roads and trails year round. State and local agencies
and neighboring landowners expressed concerns that the new Colorado Division of Wildlife's Grieve Conservation
Easement would open the Fly Creek area to motorized traffic (consistent with the current RMP travel management designation)
and cause unacceptable impacts to natural resources, especially wildlife and soils.


The affected public lands include identified soil erosion hazard and important high quality big game habitat. The
public lands are neighbored by private lands and in many places the boundaries are not marked or otherwise identified,
thus creating potential trespass situations. The area also contains several grazing allotments which at times require
motorized vehicle access by the permittee for maintenance of range facilities.



Given due consideration of the concerns expressed by the public and the potential impacts of unrestricted motorized
vehicle use, a modification of existing OHV use designations is necessary to adequately protect natural resources
on public land, minimize conflicts with other uses, prevent trespass problems, and ensure public safety until the
off-highway vehicle management portion of the little Snake Resource Area Resource Management Plan is reviewed and
if necessary modified. Provisions will be made to allow for necessary motorized travel on the public lands for administrative
purposes and to facilitate non-motorized public access, snowmobiles and travel on designated routes on public lands
in the Fly Creek area.
Public information, including detailed maps of the restricted area, roads and trails will be posted at the access
sites and available in the Resource Area Office and District Office at the addresses shown below.
Persons who are exempt from the restrictions contained in this notice include:
1. Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, emergency and law enforcement activities.
2. BLM employees engaged in official duties.
3. Persons or agencies holding a valid permit or right-of-way on or across the restricted public land for access to
private land, for purposes related to the access of private land on said easement only.
4. Persons or agencies holding a special use permit or right-of-way accessing public lands for purposes consistent
with the permit.
5. Grazing permittees authorized during the permitted grazing season for grazing related purposes provided such
motorized use is limited to existing roads and trails and subject to any additional conditions in the grazing permit.
Any motorized use before or after the permitted grazing season necessary for maintenance and operation of range facilities
shall require advance approval by the authorized officer specifically authorizing such use and subject to whatever
restrictions are deemed necessary.




PENALTIES: 

Violations of this restriction order are punishable by fines not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed
12 months.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Lodging a Joint Stipulation of Settlement Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, and 42 U.S.C. 6973(d), notice is hereby given that on August 24,
1994, a proposed joint stipulation of settlement in 

United States 

v. 

Dale Valentine, et al.,

 Civil Action No. 93CV1005J, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.
The complaint filed by the United States on February 19, 1993, seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties under Section
7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6973. The complaint alleges that an abandoned
oil reprocessing facility near Glenrock, Wyoming, commonly known as Powder River Crude Processors or Big Muddy Oil
Processors (the ``Site''), may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment.
The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations of administrative orders issued by EPA
under Section 7003 of RCRA for a cleanup of the Site.
Under the stipulation, one of the ten defendants named in the action, Richard Wallace, will pay a civil penalty of $30,000
to the United States for violations of the administrative order issued by EPA to him on October 3, 1991. The stipulation
provides that the penalty claim alleged in the Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice, and all other claims alleged
in the Complaint, which include the claims for injunctive relief, will be dismissed without prejudice. This settlement
is based in part on information provided to the United States by Defendant Wallace indicating that his financial ability
to pay a civil penalty is limited. Five other defendants in this action are performing work pursuant to a consent decree
entered by the Court on June 21, 1994, designed to address conditions at the Site which may present an imminent and substantial
endangerment to health or the environment.
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed stipulation of settlement. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General
of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington,
DC 20044, and should refer to 

United States

 v. 

Dale Valentine, et al.,

 DOJ Ref. 

#

90-7-1-692.
The proposed stipulation may be examined at the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Wyoming, 3rd
Floor, Federal Building, 111 South Wolcott, Casper, Wyoming 82601; the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, Region 8, 999 18th Street_Suite 500, Denver, Colo. 80202-2466; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120
``G'' Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 624-0892. A copy of the proposed stipulation may be
obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G Street NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005. In

Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 16(b) through (h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the Central District of California in 

United States of America 

v. 

California SunCare, Inc., 

Civil Action No. 94-5522. The Complaint in this case alleged that California SunCare, Inc. engaged in a combination
and conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, to fix the resale prices of indoor tanning
products sold by California SunCare to dealers throughout the United States. The proposed Final Judgment enjoins
the defendant from entering into or maintaining, any agreement, understanding, combination or conspiracy with
any of its dealers or potential dealers to fix the resale price of indoor tanning products. The proposed Final Judgment
further enjoins the defendant for a period of five years from the date of entry of the final judgment from directly or
indirectly announcing to the public or to any present or potential dealer of its indoor tanning products that defendant
has or is adopting, promulgating, suggesting, announcing or establishing any resale pricing policy for indoor tanning
products that provides that: (1) defendant will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above defendant's suggested
resale price, and/or (2) defendant will terminate any dealer for pricing below defendant's suggested resale price.
Finally, the defendant is also enjoined for a period of five years from the date of entry of the final judgment from (1)
threatening any dealer with termination or terminating any dealer for pricing below the defendant's suggested resale
price, and (2) discussing with any present or potential dealer any decision regarding termination of any other dealer

United States of America, Plaintiff, 

v. 

California Suncare, Inc., Defendant. 

Civil Action No. 94-5522ABC; Competitive Impact Statement.

The United States of America, pursuant to Section 2 of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA''), 15 U.S.C.
 16(b), submits this Competitive Impact Statement in connection with the proposed Final Judgment submitted
for entry in this civil antitrust proceeding.



I



Nature And Purpose Of The Proceeding



On August 12, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C.  4, alleging that the defendant California SunCare, Inc. (``California SunCare'') engaged in a combination
and conspiracy, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, to fix the price of indoor tanning products
sold by California SunCare to dealers throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that, in furtherance of
this conspiracy, California SunCare:

(a) established and communicated to dealers a minimum resale price for indoor tanning products from California SunCare;
and

(b) obtained agreements from dealers to maintain the minimum price as a condition of receiving and continuing to receive
indoor tanning products from California SunCare.

The complaint also alleges that as a result of the combination and conspiracy, prices of indoor tanning products have
been fixed and maintained, and competition in sales of indoor tanning products has been restrained.

The complaint alleges that the combination and conspiracy is illegal, and seeks to enjoin California SunCare from
continuing or renewing the alleged combination or conspiracy and from engaging in any combination or conspiracy
or adopting any practice or plan having a similar purpose or effect.

The United States and California SunCare have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance
with the APPA, unless the United States withdraws its consent.

The Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction
over the matter for possible further proceedings to construe, modify or enforce the Judgment, or to punish violations
of any of its provisions.




II



Description Of Practices Giving Rise To The Alleged Violation Of The Antitrust Laws



California SunCare, a California corporation, is a leading seller of indoor tanning products in the United States.
Indoor tanning products sold by California SunCare are manufactured in California by California SunCare. California
SunCare sells indoor tanning products to dealers which sell them to indoor tanning salons, which in turn sell them
to consumers. Each year, California SunCare publishes a resale price schedule stating the price at which California
SunCare believes its products should be resold by dealers to salons.

During the period from November 1992 through April 1994, California SunCare confronted several dealers who were
selling California SunCare products at a discount. The discounts included new customer discounts, discounts for
trade association members, and free product after a certain number of bonus points had been earned on previous purchases.
California SunCare obtained agreements from these dealers to maintain California SunCare's announced resale prices
on indoor tanning products.

In April, 1994, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice began an investigation into California SunCare's
pricing policy.

III


Explanation Of The Proposed Final Judgment




The parties have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court at any time after compliance
with the APPA. The proposed Final Judgment states that it shall not constitute an admission by either party with respect
to any issue of fact or law.

The proposed Final Judgment enjoins any direct or indirect continuation or renewal of the type of conspiracy alleged
in the complaint. Specifically, Section IV enjoins and restrains the defendant from entering into, adhering to,
maintaining, furthering, enforcing or claiming any right under any contract, agreement, understanding, plan or
program with any dealer to fix, stabilize, or maintain the resale prices at which indoor tanning products sold or distributed
by the defendant may be sold or offered for sale in the United States by any dealer.

The proposed Final Judgment not only bars California SunCare's Unlawful practices, but also contains additional
provisions that are remedial in nature. Section IV provides that the defendant is prohibited for five years from announcing
to the public or to any present or potential dealer of its indoor tanning products that defendant has or is adopting,
promulgating, suggesting, announcing or establishing any resale pricing policy for indoor tanning products that
provides that: (1) defendant will sell only to a dealer that prices at or above defendant's suggested resale price,
and/or (2) defendant will terminate any dealer for pricing below defendant's suggested resale price.

Additionally, the defendant is prohibited for a period of five years from the date of entry of the final judgment from
(1) threatening any dealer with termination or terminating any dealer for pricing below the defendant's suggested
resale price, and (2) discussing with any present or potential dealer any decision regarding termination of any other
dealer for any reason directly or indirectly related to the latter dealer's pricing below defendant's suggested
resale price.

Section V of the proposed Final Judgment is designed to ensure that California SunCare's dealers are aware of the limitations
imposed on it by the Final Judgment. Section V requires the defendant to send notices and copies of the Judgment to each
dealer who purchased indoor tanning products from the defendant in 1992, 1993 or 1994. In addition, the defendant
is required to send notices and copies of the Judgment to every other dealer who purchases indoor tanning products
from California SunCare within ten years of the date of entry of the proposed Final Judgment.

Section VI requires the defendant to set up an antitrust compliance program. The defendant is also required to furnish
a copy of the Judgment to each of its officers and directors and each of its non-clerical employees, representatives,
or agents with supervisory or direct responsibility for the sale or advertising of indoor tanning products in the
United States.

In addition, the proposed Final Judgment provides methods for determining and securing the defendant's compliance
with its terms. Section VIII provides that, upon request of the Department of Justice, the defendant shall submit
written reports, under oath, with respect to any of the matters contained in the Judgment. Additionally, the Department
of Justice is permitted to inspect and copy all books and records and to interview officers, directors, employees
and agents of the defendant.

Section IX makes the Judgment effective for ten years from the date of its entry.

<PARENT> FR940830-2-00056 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section XI of the proposed Final Judgment states that entry of the Judgment is in the public interest. Under the provisions
of the APPA, entry of the proposed Final Judgment is conditional upon a determination by the Court that the proposed
Final Judgment is in the public interest.
The Government believes that the proposed Final Judgment is fully adequate to prevent the continuation or recurrence
of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act alleged in the Complaint, and that disposition of this proceeding without
further litigation is appropriate and in the public interest.


IV


Remedies Available To Potential Private Litigants


Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct
prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered,
as well as costs and reasonable attorney fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist
the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.
 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has no 

prima facie

 effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against the defendant.


V


Procedures Available for Modification of The Proposed Final Judgment


The United States and the defendant have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after
compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent.
The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which
any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who
wants to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the 

Federal Register

. The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to the
comments. The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the 

Federal Register

.
Written comments should be submitted to: Marvin N. Price, Jr., Midwest Office, Antitrust Division, United States
Department of Justice, Suite 600, 209 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
Under Section X of the proposed Judgment, the Court will retain jurisdiction over this matter for the purpose of enabling
any of the parties to apply to the Court for such further orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate for
the construction, implementation, modification, or enforcement of the Judgment, or for the punishment of any violations
of the Judgment.


VI


Alternative To The Proposed Final Judgment


The only alternative to the proposed Final Judgment considered by the Government was a full trial on the merits and
on relief. Such litigation would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted because the proposed
Final Judgment provides appropriate relief against the violations alleged in the complaint.


VII


Determinative Materials And Documents


No materials or documents were determinative in formulating the proposed Final Judgment. Consequently, the Government

In the United States District Court for the District of Delaware


United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc., Defendant; Filed August 15, 1994; Civ.
No. 94-208


Comments Relating to Proposed Final Judgment and Response of United States to Comments


Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h), the
United States hereby files comments it has received relating to the proposed Final Judgment in this civil antitrust
proceeding, and herein responds to those comments.
This action commenced on April 21, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that an anticompetitive
practice of defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS'') constituted a tying arrangement that was per
se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, and that constituted a means whereby EPS unlawfully
had maintained a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions
of the State of Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
 2. The United States simultaneously filed a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement and a
Stipulation signed by the parties consenting to entry of the Final Judgment.
The sixty-day waiting period provided for by 15 U.S.C.  16(b) for submission of public comments expired on July
11, 1994. The United States received comments from Cash Station, Inc. (``Cash Station''), Chemical Banking Corporation
(``Chemical Bank''), Citicorp Credit Services, Inc. (``Citicorp''), William R. Kennedy, Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
(``Meridian''), Midwest Payment Systems, Inc. (``MPS''), Money Station, Inc. (``Money Station''), and The New
York Switch Corporation (``NYCE''). The United States also received an anonymous comment. The United States responds
herein to these comments.


I. Stored Value Cards


The subject raised most often by the comments was the treatment of stored value cards under the proposed Final Judgment.
Stored value cards are designed to accept a ``deposit'' of funds, which are then drawn down by transfer to other parties
in transactions. The card effectively replaces cash in these transactions. The most common use of stored value cards
today is in public transit, most notably in the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in the San Francisco area and the Washington,
DC Metro system. Rather than paying separately for each ride, a customer purchases a card for a certain amount, that
amount is ``deposited in'' the card, and the cost of each subsequent ride is deducted from the value in the card. The
passenger may add value to the card with additional ``deposits.'' Libraries also commonly sell stored valued cards
for use in their copying machines.

The banking industry expects that stored value cards will be used in many other types of transactions in the foreseeable
future. Pilot projects are under way for use of stored value cards with merchants, in vending machines, and at laundromats.
While the stored value cards in use today are often paper with a magnetic stripe, these cards are generally expected
to be made of more durable material and function through an internal integrated circuit, or ``chip,'' and are often
referred to as ``smart cards.''

The comments dealing with this subject suggested that EPS could unlawfully maintain its monopoly in access to regional
ATM networks, or extend its geographic scope, through regulations on the stored value feature of hybrid ATM/stored
value cards issued by members of its ATM network.These commenters suggested that the proposed Final Judgment could
contain various restrictions on the ability of EPS to issue such regulations.






Section IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits EPS from restricting the branding of ATMs with the marks of networks
in addition to MAC, and likewise enjoins EPS from restricting the branding of ATM cards with the marks of multiple networks
by banks in certain states. A later clause in Section IV.H provides that, ``notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant
* * * may restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with
a stored value function.''

The effect of this clause is to exclude the branding of the stored value function from the injunction against restrictions
on multiple branding of cards. EPS may, within the limits of antitrust and other applicable laws, restrict the branding
of ``stand-alone'' stored value cards (cards having no ATM functions) and the stored value function of ``hybrid''
ATM/stored value cards. EPS may not, however, restrict the branding of stand-alone ATM cards or the ATM functions
of hybrid cards, nor may EPS defeat the injunction against restrictions on dual branding by converting ATM functions
to integrated circuit technology.
 The clause is necessary since in its absence paragraph IV.H could be interpreted to enjoin EPS from restricting the
branding of both the stored value function and the ATM functions of hybrid cards.





Any other construction would lead to results not intended by the proposed Final Judgment. As discussed in the Competitive
Impact Statement, the goal of Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment is to ensure that MAC member depository
institutions can participate in non-MAC ATM networks in practice as well as in theory. To that end, EPS must permit
a member's ATM cards to function in the other networks in which that member participates; EPS cannot block these cards
from functioning in multiple networks. In general, cardholders are aware of such multiple network functionality
primarily because their ATM cards carry the brands of the relevant networks. If the clause were interpreted to allow
EPS to restrict the branding of both the stored value and the ATM features of hybrid ATM/stored value cards, the result
would be that these hybrid cards would function as ATM cards in another network (as required by the proposed Final Judgment)
but would carry no brand for that network. Cardholders would thus be unaware of their ability to access this network,
and would not use the card for that purpose. This result_cards with ``hidden'' functionalty_was not intended by either
party to the proposed Final Judgment.

The United States is not aware of any current multiple branding restrictions on stand-alone stored value cards or
the stored value function of hybrid ATM/stored value cards in the MAC network. Nothing in the proposed Final Judgment,
or any other document filed by the United States in this action, should be interpreted as evidencing a conclusion by
the United States that such restrictions would or would not be a violation of the antitrust laws. Contrary to the observation
in a comment filed by Chemical Bank, the proposed Final Judgment does not give EPS the ``right'' to issue such regulations;
rather, EPS continues to be bound by the antitrust laws and any other applicable laws. If such regulations are issued
and prove to be an antitrust violation, they can and would be challenged at the appropriate time.



II. POS Issues



Comments filed by MPS, Money Station and an anonymous source argued that the proposed Final Judgment should apply
to access to point-of-sale (``POS'') network services as well as access to regional ATM network services.
 As previously noted, the investigation conducted by the United States concluded that EPS had unlawfully maintained
a monopoly in access to regional ATM network services in certain geographic areas. It did not determine whether EPS
had market power in POS services, or whether the conduct of EPS in relation to its POS network business constituted
an antitrust violation.





As explained more fully in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, MAC has maintained its monopoly in access
to regional ATM network services in part by preventing the use of third party processors by its member depository institutions.
It is the understanding of the United States that EPS does not forbid the use of third party processors in its POS network.
 Moreover, although the comments noted that EPS was a significant supplier of POS network services and suggested that
it might exercise its strength in this area to maintain its monopoly in access to ATM network services, none of the comments
indicated that EPS was taking any action of this type.
 Nevertheless, the proposed Final Judgment does not, as argued by Money Station, leave EPS ``free'' to place restrictions
on the use of POS services by MAC members. Rather, EPS is bound by the antitrust laws and other applicable laws. If the
conduct of EPS in the provision of POS network services constitutes an antitrust violation, it can and would be challenged
at the appropriate time.

III. Voidability of Contracts



Cash Station expressed concern that the proposed Final Judgment does not make clear that ATM processing and authorization
processing contracts between EPS and its members are voidable by the members.

Paragraph IV.A of the proposed Final Judgment states in relevant part:




Defendent shall not maintain or enforce any * * * contract * * * pursuant to which defendant
requires any depository institution to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant; that
prohibits or purports to prohibit a depository institution from obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing
from any third party processor; or that conditions MAC membership or availability of MAC or any successor branded
ATM network access on any depository institution's obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant
or not obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor.




This provision makes void any contracts containing such clauses. Paragraph IV.I of the proposed Final Judgment permits
EPS to enter into new contracts with any customers, including those whose contracts have become void under the terms
of Paragraph IV.A, provided that it supplies a copy of the Final Judgment to those customers and the new contracts conform
to the terms of the Final Judgment.



Cash Station also expressed concern that unless EPS were required to explicitly notify those customers whose contracts
were voided by the proposed Final Judgment it would continue to reap the benefits of these contracts until they expired.
Notification is provided for in the proposed Final Judgment, which requires EPS to provide a copy of the Final Judgment
to all of its customers. In addition, third party processors and competing regional ATM networks will be highly likely
to bring this fact to the attention of potential customers.



IV. Gateways



MPS suggested that the proposed Final Judgment should require EPS to establish ``gateways'' with other regional
ATM networks.
 The United States considered this issue in the course of its investigation and concluded that ensuring that MAC members
would be permitted to use third party processors would be a simpler and more efficient type of injunctive relief to
remove the barriers to entry of competing networks, since access to other networks will be offered by these third party
processors.





V. Non-bank ATM Deployers



An anonymous comment stated that the proposed Final Judgment did not clearly apply to ATM deployers other than depository
institutions. Paragraph II.H clearly states that ``depository institution'' for purposes of the proposed Final
Judgment includes all MAC members who deploy ATMs. The proposed Final Judgment therefore applies to all MAC members,
whether or not depository institutions.




VI. Technical, Financial and Operating Rules



Paragraph IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to provide qualified third party processors access to
the MAC network. Because a ``qualified'' third party processor is defined in part as one which meets the defendant's
existing technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors, an anonymous
comment argued that the United States should undertake a comprehensive review of the existing criteria and each change
to the criteria.

The terms of the proposed Final Judgment render such a detailed review unnecessary. The paragraph in question makes
clear that these criteria are the same for both third party processors and intercept processors.
 As discussed in the Competitive Impact Statement, the United States has concluded that EPS has a strong incentive
to deal fairly with its intercept processors, and requiring equal treatment of third party processors and intercept
processors should therefore assure that third party processors are also dealt with fairly.





While a subsequent clause allows EPS to establish additional technical criteria for third party processors, the
clause states that additional technical criteria may only concern the transaction information to be transmitted
and the communication and data format. Moreover, the additional criteria may not discriminate between third party
processors and intercept processors.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00108 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00057 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The comment lists several possible methods by which third party processors could be treated unfairly by EPS, such
as delays in the payment of moneys owed, unnecessary mandatory training sessions, and late notification of network
technical changes. Because the proposed Final Judgment requires that third party processors and intercept processors
have equal access to the network, any such discriminatory treatment would violate the proposed Final Judgment. Additional
restrictions are unnecessary.



VII. Pricing Structure



An anonymous comment discussed the EPS pricing structure for third party processors and suggested several changes
to that structure for incorporation into the Final Judgment. One section of this comment alleged that EPS rules require
third party processors seeking access to the MAC network to be ``sponsored'' by a MAC member depository institution,
and that the third party processor is often charged a fee by the MAC member for this sponsorship. Such a sponsorship
requirement would violate paragraph IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment, which requires that third party processors
be offered access to the MAC network equal in type and quality to that offered to intercept processors.

The comment also stated that the charge paid by third party processors in most ATM networks consists of a combination
of a charge from the network and a charge from the card-issuing bank, and that this latter charge is paid by the network
to the card-issuing bank.
 The comment alleged that this ``bundling'' of fees is anticompetitive, apparently arguing that this conduct constitutes
a tying violation. However, a traditional element of tying violations is that the products are actually separate;
in other words, that they can be or have been bought or sold separately. The comment itself suggests that all ATM networks
currently charge in this manner. Moreover, to the knowledge of the United States, EPS is not currently engaged in such
conduct since, as discussed in the Complaint and Competitive Impact Statement, EPS essentially has no third party
processors in its network. If EPS chooses to institute such a pricing policy it can then be determined if the policy
violates the proposed Final Judgment or antitrust laws.





Finally, the comment argues that the proposed Final Judgment should order EPS to distribute MAC price lists as a method
of ``policing'' the non-discrimination clause. However, there is no reason to believe either that EPS will violate
the proposed Final Judgment by offering discriminatory pricing or that it would be able to keep such a blatant violation
confidential. In addition, the proposed Final Judgment permits the United States to issue inquiries to EPS which
would easily determine its pricing arrangements. It is therefore not necessary to order publication of price lists.



VIII. Subswitching



Money Station argued that by permitting EPS to charge for subswitching of transactions, the proposed Final Judgment
interferes with the ability of third party processors to access the network. ``Subswitching'' refers to the switching
of transactions between members of the same regional network without accessing that network, and therefore without
paying its switch fees. Generally this is done by passing the transaction through a third party processor that provides
ATM processing for both members. Many regional ATM networks, although not all, have rules against subswitching.
These networks argue that cardholders, who make the ultimate decision about which ATM to access, choose a particular
ATM based upon their expectation that the transaction will be routed over a common regional ATM network, known to the
cardholder by the brand logo on the ATM and the card. Permitting subswitching in this view merely allows third party
processors to ``free ride'' on the advertising efforts of the common network.

Paragraph IV.G.2 of the proposed Final Judgment permits EPS to charge a royalty on subswitching equal to the price
EPS would charge for a switched transaction. As Money Station notes, this would likely discourage subswitching since
the third party processor would also charge a fee for its services. Nevertheless, this will not discourage entry by
third party processors. As described in the Complaint, third party processors have not been successful in entering
MAC's geographic region because MAC members have been unable to purchase their ATM processing services. The proposed
Final Judgment ensures that MAC members will be able to use third party processors. Inability to offer subswitching
does not appear to be a substantial barrier to entry. Moreover, third party processors wishing to offer the ability
to switch transactions can simply become a network by ``branding'' their services; in other words, putting their
brand logos on cards and ATMs. The third party processor would then become a competing regional ATM network to which
EPS, according to paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment, may not restrict access.

IX. Definition of ``Restrict''



Money Station suggests that the term ``restrict'' as used in paragraph IV.H and certain other clauses of the proposed
Final Judgment is not sufficiently defined. It was not necessary to define this term since the phrase used was ``restrict
in any manner.'' This broad prohibition on restrictions is all that is necessary; if any restriction is imposed, it
will violate the proposed Final Judgment.



X. Conclusion



Pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  16(e), the proposed Final Judgment cannot be entered unless the Court determines that
it is in the public interest. The focus of this determination is whether the relief provided by the proposed Final Judgment
is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. 

United States v. Bechtel Corp

., 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)  62,430 (N.D. Cal. 1979), 

aff'd.

 648 F.2d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied 

454 U.S. 1083 (1982). After careful consideration of the comments, the United States continues to believe that the
proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint and therefore that
entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.

After the comments and the response of the United States have been published in the 

Federal Register

, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  16(d), the United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment.

Comments on The Proposed Final Judgment


US v. 

EPS


When a shared network obtains market dominance, it can preclude use of it by other parties (financial institutions
or third party processors) by explicit exclusions or by more insidious means, generally pricing. These issues are
clearly recognized by the proposed Final Judgment, and language in section IV establishes what the ``prohibited
conduct'' would be on the part of MAC. The judgment goes on to say that MAC ``shall not restrict in any manner, directly
or indirectly, the ability. . .to obtain ATM processing or authorization for access to the MAC or any
successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant from any qualified third party processor.'' Generally, equal
access shall be provided to qualified third party processors on equal terms as those extended to intercept processors,
including aggregation of transactions. Reciprocity of processing, including pricing and terms, is also contemplated.
Defendant is also ordered to offer volume discounts to all, on substantially equal terms, and the judgment also permits
MAC to offer transaction switching at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not be greater than the price for switched
transactions. This last stipulation may need a bit of clarification for the Final Judgment to have its intended effect,
however, and that is the substance of this comment.
Banks and other financial institutions have ``joined forces'' in many, widely different combinations to offer electronic
banking services to their customers since the advent of ATM's and other electronic terminals. Generally speaking,
these combinations are formed for (1) marketing purposes, (2) particular geographic areas, (3) brand identification
that differentiates services available to particular sets of customers, and (4) cost efficiencies that result from
larger transaction bases (economies of scale). Whatever the reason, there now exists a diverse tapestry of electronic
banking associations across the United States, but in some areas, a monopolistic enterprise threatens the existence
of many smaller networks. Such is the case with MAC and its ATM network.
Open access is available, but only from a technological point of view. Financial institutions and third party processors
are essentially forced to join the dominant network to provide the greatest access possible to retail customers.
There would be no problem if the dominant network would change only for transactions (without surcharge or royalty)
based on volume of transactions presented. Then the user of the subordinate network would be paying for the marketing
benefits of its smaller network and only for the use of the ``electronic highway'' provided by the dominant network.
In fact, the brand identity of the dominant network serves no purpose to an otherwise ``unbranded'' user. Moreover,
no one would argue that the choice to join MAC should be made by weighing the advantages of its brand (with all the consequent
marketing and service differentials) against an alternative brand, but MAC's current pricing structure places
a punitive burden on third party processors and financial institutions and forces membership in the network, requiring
MAC identification, thus hastening the demise of subordinate networks and eliminating choice between different
providers of service.
Just recently the Quest Network of Kentucky sent a letter to its participants indicating that its viability had been
re-assessed, with the outcome that the Quest brand would be discontinued in favor of MAC by June 1, 1995 (letter attached).
The only reason for this change was the layering of pricing to participants in the Quest Network caused by the brand
identity of MAC on its members who were also members of the Quest Network.
A simple solution to this issue would be the ability of subordinate networks to use the dominant network for transaction
switching, paying a competitive and nondiscriminatory price for that use, but without the requirement of brand identification
(and subsequent terms and pricing) of membership in the dominant network. Reciprocity should also be a requirement,
such that if the dominant network desired the ability to use the subordinate network's transaction switching service,
it, too, would have to provide full, complete and nondiscriminatory access to its network without mandating membership
and brand identity by the dominant network members. In essence, ``open access'' should be the rule without ``branding''
each network with the other's identity in an area where there is clear dominance by one network over others. This is
the case in Illinois where four (4) networks act cooperatively to permit universal access to any cardholder in that
state without requiring any one network member (or third party processor) to join any other network. Pricing is based
solely upon the number of transactions processed.
The concept of ``ubiquity and convenience'' can only be accomplished by a truly open environment where individual
institutions, processors or networks can have access to the dominant electronic banking network, which in this case
is MAC, and where MAC members can enjoy the same reciprocity at the subordinate network terminals.
It is not clear what effect the proposed Final Judgment will have on point of sale (POS) services. Although MAC may or
may not be practicing the exact same ``anti-competitive'' conduct in the POS area as in the ATM area, certain barriers
do exist which discourage competition. For example, although MAC seems to allow member financial institutions to
use third party processors to provide POS services to such financial institution's sponsored merchants, the costs
of such an option are prohibitive. MAC charges a $25,000 ``Processor Initialization Fee'' to such a third party processor
(MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees attached). The MAC Point of Sale Schedule of Fees states that this fee is for test
time and certification, but the $25,000 only includes 20 hours of test time and there is a charge of $250 per hour for
test time which exceeds the 20 hours. This set-up or establishment fee is plainly excessive in relation to the $100
per hour, $1,000 maximum third party processor set-up fee set forth in the proposed Final Judgment. In addition, MAC
charges third party POS processors $1,000 per month for the first communications port, $2,000 per month for each additional
communications port and a $300 per month ``Processor Residency Fee''. Given the importance and dramatic rise in POS
transactions over the years, failure to explicitly include POS antitrust stipulations in the proposed Final Judgment
could have a devastating effect on competition in the POS area.
Finally, there is a curious exclusion of ``access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored
value function'' from branding restrictions in Section IV(H). If these cards should be issued by a MAC member, and
their use might include the necessity to utilize transaction switching services of MAC from a terminal other than
a MAC terminal, should they not also be included in the philosophy that says there can be no brand restriction by MAC?
It is recognized that use of these unique types of cards may involve ``off-line'' transactions throughout some period,
but the settlement and switching of settlement transactions may necessitate the same unrestricted access to the
network that magnetically striped cards would employ in an ``on-line'' mode. As an example, if a cardholder in an ``electronic
benefits'' (EBT) processing area that utilizes ``smart card'' technology is able to withdraw a certain amount of
cash from ATM's as part of the benefit distribution process, and that cardholder uses an ATM belonging to a network
or processed by a third party processor other than MAC, the network or processor should be able to switch settlement
transactions through MAC (paying the standard switching fee) without paying an excessive royalty or finding it necessary
to become a member of MAC in order to complete the transaction.

MEMORANDUM


Date: June 22, 1994
To: All Quest Network Participants
From: Mike McEvoy, President, Transaction Services Company
Subject: Future Direction of the Quest Network



On May 10, 1993, the Quest Network sent a memorandum to your organization that outlined our commitment to continue
providing Quest-branded services to financial institutions throughout this market area. Since that communication
a year ago, several major announcements and changes have occurred which has resulted in a re-assessment of the ongoing
viability of the Quest Network and the services offered under the Quest brand.
Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (EPS) is a Delaware corporation currently owned by four bank holding companies:
Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; CoreStates Financial Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; KeyCorp,
Albany, New York (successor to Society Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio); and PNC Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
These four bank holding companies have consolidated their various ATM/POS networks (MAC, Owl, Jubilee, Tri-Net
and Green Machine) into EPS under the MAC brand name. EPS has also announced plans to add two additional equity owners:
Mellon Bank Corporation and National City Corporation. Locally and regionally, the affiliates of PNC Bank, Bank
One, and National City Bank will actively participate in the MAC network and will be converting their cardholder base
and ATM terminals to the MAC brand. Liberty National Bank, which is being acquired by Banc One Corporation, has also
joined and will likewise actively participate in the MAC network. Liberty will be converting their cardholder base
and ATM terminals to the MAC brand, and will be re-marketing MAC access to other financial institutions throughout
the region.
These developments will cause a majority of the ATM and POS transactions currently processed by the Quest Network
to be converted to the MAC brand. It is difficult to develop a reasonable long-term business case for the continuation
of the Quest Network and its Quest brand when a significant portion of the transaction processing business will be
directed to the MAC network.
The owners of the Quest Network believe that the time to begin an orderly transition from the Quest brand is at hand.
The Quest Network will offer transition assistance to each of its participants, if requested, and has begun to develop
a plan to assist those participants wishing to convert to the MAC network. The Quest Network will also assist participants
that wish to convert to another network, if requested. This transition period will begin in July 1994 and will conclude
by June 1995. The Quest Network, therefore, does not expect to operate beyond June 1, 1995.
We appreciate your past loyalty, support and participation in the Quest Network and pledge to work with you and your
processors to effect a timely transition with minimal disruption to your financial institution and your customers.
If you have questions, please feel free to contact any of the owners of the Quest Network regarding any aspect of this
announcement.

Mr. Richard Rosen,


Chief, Communications and Finance Section, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW.,
room 8104, Washington, DC 20001.




Re: United States of America v. Electronic Payment Service, Inc., U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware,
Civ. No. 94-208




In response to the invitation extended on page 24712 of the May 12, 1994 edition of the Federal Register (59 FR 24712),
Cash Station, Inc. comments on the proposed Final Judgment filed in the proceeding named above.

Cash Station, Inc. operates a regional automated teller machine (``ATM'') and point-of-sale terminal (``POS'')
network, and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.

Our comments are as follows:



1. Paragraph IV.H_Branding Restrictions



Paragraph IV.H of the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to permit MAC members to display multiple network marks
on ATMs and ATM cards, stating that ``Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer
that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs * * *
[and] shall not prohibit any institution ATM card issuer located in [specified states] * * * from issuing
cards that display multiple ATM logos.'' Despite that restriction, EPS is permitted to ``restrict the branding of
access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function.''

Assuming that it is appropriate to limit EPS's ability to restrict co-branding in connection with the ``MAC'' logo,
the exclusion of stored value cards from this limitation creates a significant loophole for EPS.

First, as drafted in the proposed Final Judgment, the stored value card exception appears to allow EPS to retain its
prohibition on co-branding simply by causing all of its debit cards to be reissued on card stock that has, in addition
to the magnetic stripe found on the cards currently issued, and integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function. We expect that many of EPS's smart cards will be multipurpose cards that bear both the traditional magnetic
strip technology found on today's on-line debit cards and an integrated computer chip with a stored value function.
Assuming that it is appropriate to provide relief on the branding restrictions in the case of the stored value cards
(see below), Paragraph IV.H. should specify that such relief applies only to cards that function solely through use
of the computer chip and do not also function as a traditional debit card using existing magnetic strip technology.
Otherwise, the benefits sought to be obtained under Paragraph IV.H. may be illusory.

Second, again assuming the EPS is entitled to some relief with respect to its stored value card, we question whether
EPS should be allowed to further the market power enjoyed by the ``MAC'' ATM brand by suing that brand to identify the
store value card technology. In other words, if EPS is allowed to avoid the effects of the Final Judgment in connection
with an ancillary product, should it not also be precluded from promoting the ancillary product with the brand that
is central to the Final Judgment?

Finally, it is not clear why any protection is appropriate in the case of EPS's stored value card product. It is our understanding
that EPS did not invent the chip card technology but is simply applying existing technology.



2. Paragraph IV.I._Voidability of Existing Processing Contracts.



The proposed Final Judgment does not clearly indicate that the contracts entered into illegally by EPS for ATM processing
and authorization processing are voidable at any time by the financial institutions. Paragraph IV.A of the proposed
Final Judgment states that EPS ``shall not maintain or enforce any * * * contract, agreement or arrangement''
that furthers the tying practices that are the subject of the proceeding, and Paragraph IV.I. of the proposed Final
Judgment allows EPS to sign up new customers by delivering a copy of the Final Judgment (apparently on a prospective
basis only), but nowhere is it stated affirmatively that each of EPS's existing ATM and authorization processing
customers may cancel its processing agreements with EPS at any time without penalty or that EPS must notify its customers
of their rights to terminate these agreements. If it is not made clear that the existing contracts are voidable, EPS
may enjoy the benefits of the tying arrangements through the expiration of these contracts, which may not occur for
several years.

Comments of Citicorp Credit Services, Inc., Concerning the Proposed Consent Decree in United States v. Electronic
Payments Services, Inc.



Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b), Citicorp Credit Services,
Inc. (``Citicorp'') submits these comments concerning the proposed consent decree in 

United States 

v. 

Electronic Payments Services, Inc., 

which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21, 1994, and published in
the 

Federal Register 

on May 12, 1994. Citicorp is not a member of defendant Electronic Payment Services' (``EPS'') ATM network, Money Access
Service (``MAC''). Citicorp is, however, involved in all aspects of electronic fund payments, including credit
cards, ATM cards, and, more recently, access cards containing an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function, or ``smart cards''.

The Complaint on which the consent decree is based alleges that MAC is the largest ATM network in the United States by
transaction volume; that EPS has entered into agreements with a multitude of banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
and other states; that more than ninety percent of all ATMs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware are connected
to MAC; that MAC is the ``dominant'' ATM network in those states; and that ``nearly all banks'' regard MAC as, in effect,
an essential facility for entry into the ATM business. (   14, 19, 20.) The Complaint further alleges that
EPS has used its ``monopoly power'' to exclude competitors from the ATM business in MAC's areas of dominance. ( 25.)


The proposed consent decree is intended to put an end to EPS' anticompetitive practices and thereby to increase ATM
network competition. Citicorp is concerned, however, that the proposed consent decree could be understood_or,
more likely, misunderstood_to give EPS license to engage in what may be anticompetitive conduct with respect to the
smart card business.

The source of this concern is Paragraph H of Section IV of the proposed consent decree. Among other things, that Paragraph
prohibits EPS from restricting MAC-member banks from issuing ATM cards that display multiple ATM network logos.
The Paragraph goes on to state, however, that EPS ``may restrict'' multiple branding of smart cards. The Competitive
Impact Statement asserts that permitting EPS to restrict multiple branding of smart cards will not lessen the pro-competitive
impact of the consent decree (page 16, n.10).

Citicorp understands these statements to mean only that restrictions on multiple branding of smart cards are not
prohibited by the consent decree. But the language is not clear and could be read to manifest a conclusion by the Department
of Justice that restrictions on multiple branding, and perhaps other EPS restrictions on smart cards, are not anticompetitive.
No such conclusion is warranted on this record, and the Department should make clear that it has reached no such conclusion.

It is too early to know whether future restrictions on smart card branding, or other restrictions not barred by the
proposed consent decree, would be procompetitive or anticompetitive. It is not difficult to imagine, however, how
EPS could engage in anticompetitive practices that could injure the fledgling smart card business if EPS' dominant
position in the ATM network market persists.

For example, if successful development of non-MAC smart card networks required participation of many or all of the
thousands of MAC-member banks, EPS could deal a crippling blow to competing smart card networks by prohibiting MAC-member
banks from participating in non-MAC smart card networks. Similarly, if access to the MAC ATM network were essential
to the success of competing smart cards, EPS could doom competitors by prohibiting such access.

EPS could achieve the same objectives through less direct means. EPS could impose operating rules or technical restrictions
on third-party processors that as a practical matter make it impossible for MAC-member banks' ATM machines to be accessed
by non-MAC smart cards or cards that utilize a technology different from that used for MAC smart cards.
 Such restrictions would be similar to the ATM network processing restrictions that are prohibited by the proposed
consent decree.





Restrictions on multiple smart card branding could also make it economically infeasible for banks to participate
in more than one smart card network. MAC-member banks that issue MAC smart cards would have to issue additional cards
to give their customers access to non-MAC machines and networks. The resulting additional costs could discourage
MAC-member banks from participating in other smart card networks and thereby impede the development of competing
networks.

Depending on the circumstances, any of these kinds of restrictions could reduce competition and prevent the development
of alternative, and perhaps superior, smart card technologies. The risk, in short, is that EPS could use its existing
dominant power in ATM networks and ATM processing, and the MAC-member banks' control of essential facilities, to
prevent the establishment of competing smart card networks and thereby leverage its ATM monopoly into market power
in the smart card business. If so, EPS' restrictions could injure both MAC-member banks (and their customers) and,
perhaps more important, entities (and their potential customers) that would prefer not to join MAC but rather to compete
against it.

Accordingly, Citicorp urges the Department of Justice to make clear for the Court and the public that the proposed
consent decree does not authorize EPS to impose any branding restrictions for smart cards or reflect any conclusion
by the Department about the competitive significance of any potential EPS restrictions regarding smart cards. Such
a clarification would not require any substantive changes to the proposed consent decree. Instead, the Department
could clarify the meaning of the proposed consent decree in the response to the public comments that it submits to the
Court pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b).

The development of smart card technology and networks offers enormous potential benefits to the public. Citicorp
urges the Department to keep a watchful eye in order to prevent anticompetitive conduct by EPS that could hinder the
full development of smart card technology and its applications.

Dear Mr. Rosen: I wish to state my opposition to the exception provision offered in the Consent Decree against EPS,
Inc. regarding the limited branding of Smart Cards.

Sepcifically, the exception will eventually undermine the intent of the Decree to allow for greater competition
if allowed to stand without greater clarity. EPS should not be permitted to have a privileged posture on limited branding
for cards containing an intergrated chip simply because they are heavily into its innovation. Future growth of this
technology will require greater acceptance and access considerations to wit this provision ignores. Make the better
and far more universal interpretation that branding of all types of cards is in the greater interest of competition
and eliminate this loophole provision.

Re: United States v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (EPS)







Dear Mr. Liefesbind: On behalf of Meridian Bancorp, Inc., ``Meridian,'' a bank & financial services holding
company headquartered in Reading, Pennsylvania, I would like to make the following comments to the Consent Decree
relating to the branding of electronic stored value cards (smart cards).


It is our opinion that the provision in Section IV (H) which would allow EPS to ``restrict the branding of access cards
that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with stored value function'' is contrary to the competitive provisions
being decreed in the balance of paragraph H. This exemption implies that EPS would be able to regulate the market by
mandating that it's member institutions only issue smart cards that carry the EPS brand, and that only cards that carry
the sole EPS brand would be capable of accessing accounts at an EPS certified ATM machine. An issuer that belongs to
other networks would have to issue secondary cards, at additional expenses, to allow it's customers access via non-EPA
networks.


Additionally, we would also like to point out the inconsistency in the implied assumption that a smart card is different
from an ordinary ATM card which carries a magnetic stripe. It is quite likely that both features would have to co-exist
on the same card to allow account access as well as ``refueling'' of the electronic chip at nationally branded terminals
such as CIRRUS and PLUS outside of the EPS market area.



By allowing EPS to dictate the non-branding of these cards a loophole has been created which would allow EPS to control
network access of it's member banks and restrict the competitive potential of other regional networks. We feel that
this exception should be removed from the Consent Decree and in fact specific language should indicate that smart
card and smart card technology are included within the scope of the decree.





Sincerely,

Background



Chemical is a bank holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware which participates through certain of its
subsidiary banks in many ATM networks. Chemical is also a shareholder in the New York Switch Corporation (``NYS'')
which owns, operates and controls the New York Cash Exchange ATM network (the ``NYCE Network'') and will be a shareholder
in the proposed network to be formed by the merger of the New York Switch Corporation and NENI Inc. when such network
is approved. Chemical's subsidiaries, Chemical Bank and Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A., are each a participant in
both the MAC and the NYCE networks, among other ATM networks. Through its subsidiary, Chemical Bank, Chemical is working
on projects involving the use of smart card technology and has implemented a pilot project using AT&T technology
to test various smart card applications.

Re: Comments of Money Station, Inc. on Proposed Final Judgment in United States v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc.,
Civ. No. 94-208, D. Del.



Gentlemen: Money Station, Inc. (Money Station) submits this comment pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Sections 16(b), (d), on
the proposed Final Judgment in United States vs. Electronic Payment Services, Inc.

 published on May 12, 1994, at 59 Fed. Reg. 24711 

et seq.
According to the Competitive Impact Statement published along with the proposed Final Judgment, Electronic Payment
Services, Inc. (EPS) has maintained a ``tying arrangement that is per se unlawful'' by foreclosing independent third-party
ATM processors (id.

 at 24718) as ``has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access'' (

id.

) in numerous states, including ``substantial portions of the state of Ohio'' (

id

). The proposed Final Judgment is intended to advance the public interest in both a direct and an indirect way. The intended
direct benefit is to increase competition in the market for ATM processing services by eliminating the tying arrangement.
The intended indirect benefit is to increase competition in the market for regional ATM access by making it possible
for banks to join multiple ATM networks through third-party ATM processors.
Money Station operates an ATM network principally located in Ohio, but which also has participants located in Kentucky,
Indiana and West Virginia (where EPS is also alleged to have monopoly power) with ATM machines that bear the Money Station
trademark and are linked to the Money Station network. Money Station represents exactly the kind of potential and
actual competition that the Government looks to as a means of making the market for regional ATM access more competitive
in the geographic areas where MAC is currently the ubiquitous network with market power. Consequently, Money Station
has reviewed the proposed Final Judgment carefully.
Money Station agrees with the Government that elimination of the tying arrangement, if effectively implemented,
will open up competition for ATM processing services. Money Station, however, has far less confidence that competition
in ATM processing services can overcome the ``collective action program,'' referred to in the Competitive Impact
Statement, in the market for regional ATM access. (

Id.

 at 24720.) There are genuine economic costs associated with joining more than one regional network (

e.g.,

 card issuance costs, signage costs). Unless multiple banks act simultaneously to join one or more competing networks
in addition to the ubiquitous network, no benefits can accrue to the individual bank that joins one or more such competing
networks. In other words, no bank will incur the costs to join network B in addition to the ubiquitous network A unless
network B provides sufficient ATMs and cards that the bank's transaction volume flowing through network B generates
enough income (or savings) to justify the costs associated with joining network B. That transaction volume depends
on the actions of other banks. This ``collective action'' problem is exacerbated if the ubiquitous network with market
power is able to establish any disincentives (whether technical or economic) against joining other networks.
Nevertheless, Money Station recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement challenged in the complaint in
this case, if effectively implemented, does open up competition for ATM processing services and is thus in the public
interest. Money Station further recognizes that elimination of the tying arrangement, again if effectively implemented,
is a necessary first step, even if not a totally sufficient step, in opening up the market for regional ATM access and
so, again, is in the public interest. Money Station therefore supports the proposed Final Judgment as a general matter.
To ensure, however, the effectiveness of the proposed Final Judgment, Money Station recommends that several issues
be addressed before the proposed Final Judgment is approved.

First, the same card that provides access to ATMs also usually provides access to POS devices, and virtually every
ATM network, including the networks operated by EPS and Money Station, also operates a POS network. As Money Station
reads the proposed Final Judgment, EPS is free in the future to place restrictions on members of its MAC network (which
operates both a POS and ATM network) with respect to their right to be members in other POS networks or even, possibly,
on their right to use third-party processors for their POS outlets. Such POS-related restrictions, if imposed, would
add to the entry barriers in regional ATM access already created by the ``collective action'' problem. The proposed
Final Judgment should be clarified so that access to the MAC ATM network or to the MAC POS network is not denied, impeded,
or discriminated against through pricing or other means if a financial institution elects to join a competing POS
network.






Second, the proposed Final Judgment uses the phrase ``shall not restrict in any manner'' or similar phrases several
times. For example, Section IV(H) mandates that ``Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution
ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function in multiple ATM networks.'' There is no definition of the verb ``restrict''
in the proposed Final Judgment. The proposed Final Judgment clearly does prohibit directly exclusionary contracts
and discriminatory pricing related to ATM network membership. However, it is not clear that the proposed Final Judgment
deals effectively with various other disincentives that EPS may establish that would further discourage banks from
incurring the already significant costs and risks of joining multiple networks. Although the proposed Final Judgment
does prohibit penalties imposed on or direct legal obstructions to a bank's joining a competitive network, it is not
clear that a reward for not joining to competitive network is a restriction under the proposed Final Judgment. Given
EPS's history of practices to preserve its monopoly in the regional ATM access, it seems prudent to clarify that the
phrase ``shall not restrict'' bars any practice that creates disincentives for a bank to belong to multiple networks.

Third, Section IV(G)(2) of the proposed Final Judgment appears on its face to give EPS the discretion, with respect
to transactions between depository institutions that are members of an EPS network and switched by a third-party
processor, to impose a royalty fee equal to the price of transactions switched (

i.e., 

processed) by EPS itself. Because the third-party processor must charge some fee to cover its costs in this situation,
the combination of a license fee equal to EPS's fee (referred to in this provision as ``loyalties that shall not be greater
than the price for switched transactions'') plus the third-party processor's fee will necessarily exceed EPS's
direct fee. Therefore, this provision appears to give EPS a means to continue to hamper severely third-party processors
seeking to dissipate EPS's monopoly power. This may well negate the effectiveness of the proposed Final Judgment's
intent to open up competition in the ATM processing services and, indirectly, in regional ATM access. In Money Station's
view, Section IV(G)(2) should either be revised or clarified.

Fourth, Money Station believes that skeptical scrutiny should be given to the provision in Section IV(H) that permits
EPS to ``restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value
function.'' This language is an exemption for what are known as ``smart cards'' from the requirement in Section IV(H)
that EPS cannot bar ATM card issuers that choose to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from issuing cards that
display multiple ATM network logos or from displaying multiple ATM network logos on their ATMs. Money Station believes
that this exemption could well have a powerful anti-competitive effect on the development and competitiveness of
ATM networks other than EPS. This effect would occur if EPS took the position that the exemption language applied to
access cards that contain both a normal ``mag stripe'' feature_as do most ATM cards_as well as a ``smart card'' feature.
If so, and if EPS inserted a ``smart card'' feature on an appreciable number of cards with a traditional ``mag stripe''
feature,
 the multi-branding purpose of Section IV(H)_which seeks to sustain the competitiveness of other ATM networks_would
be undermined. In addition, Money Station is concerned that as a result of this exemption, EPS will require that ATM
or POS machines that are part of EPS's network may not accept ATM or POS cards with a ``smart card'' feature other than
that utilized or approved by EPS. In this event, the pro-competitive purpose of preventing EPS from barring co-branding
of ATM machines would also be undermined. To the best of Money Station's knowledge, EPS is 

not 

a developer of ``smart card'' technology, but simply a customer of developers of that technology. Money Station thus
believes that the theory cited in support of the exemption_``that * * * restrictive branding of electronic
stored value cards will encourage innovation and competition'' in connection with such cards
_has no applicability to EPS.

Richard L. Rosen, Esquire,


Chief, Communications and Finance Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 555 4th Street, N.W._Room
8104, Washington, DC 2001.



Re: United States v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc. Civ. No. 94-208 (D.Del.).



Dear. Mr. Rosen: I am writing on behalf of The New York Switch Corporation (``NYS'') to comment on the proposed Stipulation,
Final Judgment (``the decree''), and Competitive Impact Statement in United States v. Electronic Payment Services,
Inc.

 (``EPS''), Civ. No. 94-208, as set out at 59 Fed. Reg. 24711 (May 12, 1994). NYS operates the NYCE

 

 ATM/POS network. For many years, NYCE has been foreclosed from competing against EPS' MAC

 

 network in Pennsylvania and other states where MAC has successfully established monopoly power through the very
types of exclusionary practices which are the subject of the decree. By prohibiting its members from joining NYCE
or selecting NYCE as their processor, EPS has largely succeeded in insulating itself from competition from NYCE,
as well as from other regional ATM networks and third party processors, in Pennsylvania and a number of other states.
The remedial purpose of the proposed decree is to check EPS' market power by facilitating the entry of competing regional
ATM networks and ATM processors into markets in which EPS has heretofore exercised market power through various exclusionary
practices. To that end, the decree would prohibit EPS from restricting its depository institution members from belonging
to other networks; under the decree, EPS also cannot restrict any depository institution from (i) ``displaying multiple
ATM network logos on its ATMs''; (ii) ``issuing cards that display multiple ATM network logos''; or (iii) ``enabling
ATMs to function in multiple ATM network.''
 NYS applauds the Department of Justice for bringing this action and for achieving the foregoing remedial provisions,
which NYS supports.




What concerns NYS is the ambiguity and potential for abuse of the exception permitting EPS to ``restrict the branding
of access cards 

that contain

 an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function''
 (referred to as ``smart cards''). According to the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department has concluded that
``[p]ermitting EPS to restrict the multiple branding on smart cards will not undercut the impact of the decree because
the branding of ordinary ATM cards, which are not by far more common, is not restricted.''
 In conjunction with this statement, the Department cites the contention of EPS ``that allowing restrictive in services
among firms marketing such cards.''







NYS believes that this provision, which is an exception to the general prohibitory thrust of the decree, creates a
potential loophole which EPS could interpret to perpetuate its exclusionary practices with respect to ATM cards.
For this reason, while NYS generally supports the decree, it nevertheless urges the Department to withhold its consent
unless the exception is modified or clarified as suggested below to reduce its anticompetitive potential.


I. Tunney Act Standards


As the Department well knows, the Tunney Act, under which these comments are permitted, is intended to ensure that
antitrust consent decrees serve the public interest. As the court in the recent 

Airline Tariff Publishing

 case pointed out, one of the tests for determining whether the entry of a proposed consent judgment is in the public
interest is whether the proposed decree ``effectively opens the relevant markets to competition and prevents the
recurrence of anticompetitive activity.'' 

United States v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co.,

 1993-2 Trade Cas. (CCH)   70,409 at 71,167 (D.D.C. Nov. 1, 1993, 

quoting United States v. American Del. and Del. Co.,

 552 F. Sup. 131, 153 (D.C. 1982), 

aff'd sub. mom., Maryland v. United Sates,

 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). Using language that is applicable here, the court inquired whether the proposed final judgment
``Using language that is applicable here, the court inquired whether the proposed final judgment ``prohibit[ed]
both behavior that the government receives to be a current antitrust violation 

and behavior that could enable the settling defendants to devise methods through which to engage in anti competitive
behavior.''

NYS submits that the ambiguous language of the smart-card exception (

i.e.,

 ``cards that contain'' the stored value function) could allow EPS to continue its exclusionary conduct with respect
to 

ATM cards

 simply by merging the ATM cards with smart-card functionality. The Competitive Impact Statement does not appear
to recognize the ability of EPS to take advantage of the smart-card exception to avoid the prohibitions of the decree.
Based on its knowledge of the impending market impact of smart cards, NYS strongly believes that the Department must
directly address the anticompetitive potential of this ambiguous smart-card exception.



2. The Smart Card Exception Undermines the Purposes of the Decree



EPS has established a pattern of excluding competitors by conditioning its financial institutions' membership
on their agreement not to belong to other networks and not to use the brands of those networks on their cards and ATMs.
NYS is concerned that the smart-card exception could be interpreted and exploited by EPS to subvert the general prohibitions
in the decree against ATM and ATM card branding restrictions. Through this exception, EPS would be able to convert
its ATM cards to dual-function cards and escape the prohibitions of the decree, to the detriment of NYS competition
generally.

The Department's acceptance of the smart-card exception appears to rest on two premises: one is that stored value
cards, with their computer-chip component, are so distinct from ``ordinary ATM cards'' (which rely on magnetic stripe
technology) that the exception will not significantly affect the member institutions' use of ``ordinary ATM cards''
which are the primary focus of the Complaint; the other premise appears to be that the current number of smart cards
is still relatively low compared with the number of ordinary ATM cards and that any anticompetitive consequences
of the exception will therefore be negligible. NYS disagrees with both premises.

It cannot be assumed that ``ordinary ATM cards'' and smart cards are and will remain separate, stand-alone devices.
NYS has reason to believe that the smart card being marketed by EPS to financial institutions is not, in fact, a product
separate from the ordinary ATM card but is instead a hybrid, multi-function card that contains 

both

 a computer chip with stored value functionality 

and

 a magnetic stripe with on-line debit functionality. This dual functionality in a single card is already being tested
and its use is likely to increase substantially in the near future. Moreover, as several industry publications disclose,
EPS intends to offer a multi-purpose smart card which is basically a combination ATM/stored value card. For example,
one source reports that:




Consumers will get a micro-chip smart card that also has a mag-stripe on back. The card will be available for both on-line
debit and off-line prepaid debit applications. When consumers use the card in an ATM or on-line POS application, a
terminal will read the mag-stripe and when used in an off-line prepaid application, the terminal will read and deduct
funds from the chip memory.







Nor is it correct to assume that the number of smart cards will remain relatively low. Although just emerging, smart-card
applications are expected to expand rapidly. EPS apparently intends to market its smart card aggressively to financial
institutions throughout its service area. While the Department correctly observes that the number of smart cards
is now relatively small when compared with ordinary ATM cards, EPS has made it clear that it sees the potential for significant
growth in the use of its hybrid ATM card with a computer chip.






The decree explicitly bars EPS from restricting its members' branding of ATM cards. Yet, the intention and effect
of the smart-card exception are ambiguous. It is possible that EPS would be able to prohibit all of its member banks
from placing the NYCE brand or other competing network brands
 on 

any

 card (including an ``ordinary ATM card'') simply by adding a computer chip with stored value functionality to its
cards, a modification which is neither difficult nor expensive.

If the smart-card exception could be interpreted in the manner just suggested, the potential for exclusion of competing
networks through the exception is not an imaginary concern. A recent article in the trade press has reported that Delaware
financial institutions accounting for over 90% of the state's DDA base will issue EPS smart cards.
 As the Complaint notes, the MAC network already has a monopoly position in Delaware; virtually all Delaware financial
institutions belong to MAC. Given MAC's dominance, the smart-card exception will offer MAC another vehicle for erecting
a barrier to entry into the state. If the exception means that EPS can tell its financial institution members that they
cannot put the NYCE brand on any MAC-branded cards because those cards also happen to contain an integrated computer
chip for stored value functionality, those institutions will have to issue (at considerable cost) separate cards
if they wish to offer access to NYCE. In those states where MAC already has a monopoly, it is difficult to see what possible
incentive the financial institutions would have for joining NYCE at all. 




Furthermore, the smart-card exception is ambiguous not only with respect to exclusive branding of 

cards

 but also with respect to exclusive branding of ATMs. Under the decree, EPS is barred from restricting its members'
multiple branding of ATMs and from restricting ``any depository institution ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function
in multiple ATM networks.'' NYS is concerned, however, about ambiguity in the Competitive Impact Statement, where
it says, ``EPS must permit MAC members to display multiple network marks 

on ATMs 

and ATM card, 

except for electronic stored value cards.''


 It is NYS' understanding that EPS' smart cards will be used in its existing ATMs which will be retrofitted to handle
the additional smart-card functionality. If EPS is permitted, through an evasive interpretation of the smart-card
exception, to refuse acceptance of smart cards bearing any brand other than its own at ATMs in its network the decree's
objective of facilitating competitive access by other networks to customers in states where EPS has ATM dominance
will be seriously undermined. This issue also requires clarification.





The Smart Card Exception Will Not Encourage Innovation and Competition




In the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department acknowledges the following justification for the smart-card
exception: ``allowing restrictive branding of electronic stored value cards will encourage innovation and competition
in services among firms marketing such cards.''
 In NYS' judgment, this is not correct and does not justify the smart-card exception, even if the exception is meant
to apply only to 

stand-alone

 smart cards; this reason certainly does not justify application of the exception to a 

combined 

ATM/smart card.





First, smart-card technology is not in any sense ``new'' or ``unique''; it has been deployed widely in Europe and Japan
for several years and is now being used in various applications in this country as well.






Second, EPS is not truly an ``innovator'' with respect to smart-card technology_rather, it is 

a single customer 

of the technology. The actual producers and innovators of smart-card technology are data-technology firms such
as Schlumberger, GemPlus, Microcard, IBM and AT&T. To the extent the EPS' 

application

 of the technology makes any contribution to technological innovation or development, many other entities, including
individual banks and the national credit card networks, are also actively engaged in the development of various payment-systems
applications of smart-card technology.

Most importantly, it is difficult to see how permitting EPS to restrict its member banks from putting the logos of NYCE
and other networks on their smart cards in those states where EPS has market power will encourage innovation or technological
competition. While NYS recognizes that, under certain conditions, a restriction on co-branding of a product may
stimulate interbrand competition (thereby stimulating innovation), this benefit is achievable only where the
firm imposing the restriction is in fact 

subject

 to interbrand competition. The Complaint, however, makes clear that EPS has no competition in at least five states;
in those states, EPS has the ability to lock financial institutions into use of a single smart card, thereby excluding
any competition.

In sum NYS believes that the smart-card exception will not promote innovation in the development of smart-card technology,
even if the scope of the exception is confined to smart cards only. It is certain that an ambiguous exception which would
permit evasion of the decree would not be not be justified on that basis.



Conclusion



The intent and scope of the smart-card exception contained in Paragraph IV.H of the proposed decree are ambiguous.
The exception is susceptible to an interpretation by which EPS could continue the exclusionary practices which the
decree seeks to redress simply by adding the smart-card function to its ATM cards. surely the Department did not intend
to create such a device for evasion of the decree. NYS respectfully submits that the exception should be amended to
clarify that the exception applies 

only

 to the banding of 

stand-alone, single-function

 smart cards (those with stored value functionality provided by an integrated computer chip) and 

not

 to any type of multiple-function or hybrid ATM cards (those that use magnetic stripe technology).



To repeat, NYS supports the general thrust of the proposed decree and greatly appreciates the efforts of the Department
to open the MAC network to competition. Even so, the ambiguity of the smart-card exception and the potential for circumvention
of the decree compel the submission of these comments and concerns.

In the United States District Court for the District of Delaware



United States of America Plaintiff, v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc., Defendant.



Comments on the Proposed Final Judgment, Pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  16(b)



The following comments on the proposed Final Judgment in the above-captioned action are hereby submitted, pursuant
to 15 U.S.C.  16(b). The comments are submitted on behalf of a client that does not wish its identity to be disclosed
because of its concerns that its competitors might retaliate against it were its identity known.



Background



There has been a steady shift in the credit card processing industry from processing of card transactions by financial
institutions to processing by third party, non-financial institutions. The 1993 Edition of 

Card Industry Directory: The Blue Book of the Credit and Debit Card Industry of the United States

 (Faulkner & Gray) (hereinafter, ``the 1993 

Card Industry Directory

'') reported that the merchant processing business ``has come to be dominated by firms not controlled by banks, a trend
that concerns some executives in the banking community.'' (See Exh. A.) The most recently available figures show
that non-banks have moved to the top of the credit card processing business, with 3 of the top 10 processors being institutions
that are not affiliated with depository institutions. (See Exh. B, the 1994 Edition of 

Card Industry Directory: The Blue Book of the Credit and Debit Card Industry of the United States 

(Faulkner & Gray) (hereinafter, ``the 1994 

Card Industry Directory

''), ``Top 25 Merchant Acquirers'' list, showing NaBANCO (

#

1), Card Establishment Services (

#

3) and National Data Corp. (

#

7) among the top 10 processors, with the top 10 processors commanding more than 49% of the market.)

The same trend is apparent in the point-of-sale (``POS'') debit and ATM processing markets.
 While those processing markets have traditionally been dominated by financial institutions (with EPS, the owner
of MAC, being the largest of the top 5 Electronic Funds Transfer (``EFT'')
 Processors, by a significant margin), in 1993, 2 non-financial institutions_Deluxe Data Systems and Electronic
Data Systems_were included among the top 5 EFT Processors. (See Exh. C, 1994 Edition of the 

Debit Card Directory: The Complete Guide for the Debit Card Industry in the United States

 (Faulkner & Gray) (hereinafter, the ``1994 

Debit Card Directory

'') at p.22.)






Like the market for processing services, the market for ownership of ATMs and other similar devices has expanded well
beyond depository institutions. However, the judgment is somewhat ambiguous as to its application to ATMs owned
by entities other than depository institutions. It should be clarified to provide that all ATMs, and not just ATMs
owned by depository institutions, are included within its scope. Today, six non-depository institutions rank among
the top 300 ATM owners, owning more than 3,000 terminals. (See Discussion, 

infra

, under Comment No. 1.)

Second, and more significantly, the judgment fails to reach the overlapping and interchangeable POS debit market.
(See Discussion, 

infra

, under Comment No. 2.) According to a survey published by Faulkner & Gray in 1993, in the next 7 years significant
growth is expected in the EFT market, which encompasses both ATM and POS. Until now, the growth in EFT has primarily
been fueled by ATM growth. While ATM growth is expected to continue, it is projected that the most sizeable increases
in the EFT market will come from debit POS. Many networks have predicted that POS alone will grow by more than 50% a year
and, that by the year 2000, POS transactions will exceed ATM transactions. (See Exh. D, 1994 

Debit Card Directory

, Chapter 9, Section 1.) If POS grows at such rates, the failure of the proposed judgment to include debit POS could render
it less and less effectual as time progresses and the EFT market changes.

Moreover, it is not apparent that the Department of Justice conducted a thorough review of the existing operating,
technical, and financial requirements that restrict third party processors' access to the network, or the pricing
mechanisms governing such access, to ensure that the order truly provides third party processors with meaningful,
non-discriminatory access to the network. As discussed in Comments 3 and 4, below, the operating, technical and financial
regulations, and the complex pricing structure imposed by MAC and other networks, have the potential to pose a mine
field, severely restraining third party entry to the processing market. Those regulations and pricing must be examined
carefully and safeguards need to be put in place to assure future compliance with the judgment.
Accordingly, in order for the judgment to meet the Department's goal of eliminating MAC's monopoly power in card processing
in the affected region, the proposed Final Judgment must (1) extend to ATMs owned by non-depository institutions;
(2) encompass the debit POS network; (3) require the Department of Justice to review operating, technical, and financial
restrictions placed on third party processors by the ATM and debit networks and put related safeguards into place
to ensure that the networks provide 

meaningful

 access by third party processors; and (4) require the Department of Justice to examine the pricing structure of the
networks, and put certain safeguards into place, to be certain that the costs assessed to third party processors are
truly non-discriminatory.
Specifically, the following modifications must be made to the proposed Final Judgment:


Comment No. 1


The Final Judgment should be clarified to include ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions, as well
as those owned and deployed by depository institutions.


Discussion


Section II.B of the proposed Final Judgment defines ``ATM'' as a machine ``typically owned and deployed by a depository
institution.'' The first sentence of section II.H defines depository institution as ``a bank, saving bank, savings
and loan association, credit union or other institution authorized by federal or state law to take deposits.'' In
a second sentence, Section II.H of the judgment goes on to state that, for purposes of the Final Judgment, depository
institution includes ``any other member of a branded ATM network operated by defendant that also deploys ATMs within
that network.''

While ATMs have traditionally been owned by depository institutions, a growing number of non-depository institutions
are entering the ATM market. For example, the 1993 

Card Industry Directory 

boasted among its list of the ``Top 300 ATM Owners'' two supermarket chains, Publix Super Markets, Inc. and Wegmans
Food and Pharmacy, which, obviously, lack the demand deposit accounts necessary to constitute a ``depository institution''
within the meaning of the first sentence of section II.H. (See Exh. E., which ranks Publix as the 21st largest ATM owner
in the United States with 483 ATMs, and Wegmans as number 106 with 91 ATMs.) The 1994 

Debit Card Directory 

showed a marked increase in the number of non-depository institutions owning ATMs and the number of ATMs owned by those
institutions: the number of non-depository institutions owning ATMs increased from two to six, and the number of
ATMs owned by such non-depository institutions increased from 574 ATMs (in 1992) to 3343 (in 1993). (See Exh. F, listing
Electronic Data Systems Inc. as number 7, with 1,200 ATMs; Affiliated Computer Systems as number 10, with 950 ATMs;
Publix as number 28 with 497 ATMs; FIserv as number 29, with 496 ATMs; Delchamps Supermarkets as number 98, with 100
ATMs; and Wegmans as number 100, with 100 ATMs.)

In light of the rapidly changing identity of the ATM owners, the failure to expressly include in the Final Judgment
ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions creates a substantial potential loophole in the judgment.
As the judgment will remain in effect for the next 10 years, such a possible loophole could have an adverse effect on
competition. Unless the judgment is clarified to include ATMs owned and deployed by non-depository institutions,
the goals of the judgment_to open up the ATM network and ATM processing markets to competition by prohibiting MAC from
discriminating against third party processors in terms of pricing and access_will not be effectuated in this growing
segment of the ATM market.



Comment No. 2



The Final Judgment should apply not only to Us, which perform the traditional functions of dispensing cash, account
inquiry, payment authorization, transfer or deposit, but also to retail point-of-sale (``POS'') card acceptor
machines that perform debit transactions, that is, POS terminals that allow consumers to use bank cards linked to
demand accounts to pay for services or merchandise and, often, receive cash back from the merchant, and contemporaneously
debit the customer's depository account.



Discussion



Cash (ATM) and debit (POS) terminals provide the same service. They are sufficiently interchangeable that consumers
view them as substitutes for one another and utilize them for many of the same transactions.
 (

See 

United States Department of Justice Horizontal Merger Guidelines (1992) at  1.1, Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH)  13,104
at p. 20,572 (1992).) MAC has a significant presence in both the ATM and POS terminal markets, as set forth below. Accordingly,
all card acceptor machines, and not merely ATMs, should be included within the terms of the Final Judgment.





Debit transactions at U.S. merchants utilizing POS terminals with PIN-pads have risen substantially over the last
few years. The June 1993 issue of 

The Nilson Report 

(Issue 549) (the leading news and advisory service for credit/debit-card executives) reports that, in 1992, debit
card transactions at U.S. merchants with PIN-pad POS terminals were up 30% from 1991, sales volume was up 47%, and the
number of POS terminals with PIN pads was up 77%. (See Exh. G.)

As the 1993 

Card Industry Directory 

indicates (at p. 193), the debit card is positioning itself to ``rival the credit card as a payment system.''

``With MasterCard and Visa busily wooing card issuers to joint their respective Maestro and Interlink national on-line
point-of-sale programs, the debit card finally is reaching a position to be more than an ATM access device. Consequently,
debit card issuers have shifted their attention away from simply getting more cards into account-holders hands and
toward activating the cards already out there. The objective is to position debit as a revenue generator that could
someday rival the credit card as a payment system.''






In addition to its dominance in the ATM market, MAC has a significant, and growing, presence in the debit POS market.
At year-end 1992, MAC operated the third largest PIN-based debit system in the United States (ranked by transaction
volume). (See Exh. G.) In that year, MAC showed the strongest growth of the top 5 PIN-based debit systems (with the top
5 systems switching 84% of all transactions) and offered the largest terminal base. (See 

id

.)






MAC's position in debit POS continued to grow and strengthen. According to the 1994 

Card Industry Directory, 

the four institutions that own defendant EPS_Banc One Corp., PNC Financial Corp., Key Corp. a/n/a Society Corp. and
CoreStates_rank 7th, 13th, 22nd and 27th among the ``100 Most Active Debit Card Bases.'' (See Exh. H.) Moreover, the
1994 

Debit Card Directory 

shows that EPS is the second largest Electronic Funds Transfer Network (ATMs and POS terminals combined) (see Exh.
I) and the third largest POS network, with MAC doubling the number of its on-line terminals from 15,000 in 1992 to 32,000
in 1993 (see Exh. J. 1994 

Debit Card Directory 

at pp. 25-26). Indeed, of the top 50 EFT networks in 1993, MAC was the fastest growing EFT Network in the country,
with a 78% increase in transactions. (See Exh. I, p. 33.)

To the ultimate consumer, ATM and POS are interchangeable because they meet the same needs. MAC is a major factor in
both segments of the market. As POS terminals increasingly rival ATMs and credit cards as payment mechanisms, the
interests of the United States in opening both the network and the processing markets now dominated by MAC to competition
could be frustrated unless the Final Judgment is extended to encompass POS. Because the Final Judgment is to remain
in effect for 10 years, the failure to make that judgment applicable to point-of-sale debit networks could leave that
substantial, fast-growing segment of the market subject to the same abuses by MAC that the ATM system has been and allow
MAC to evade the purpose and intent of the order.



Comment No. 3



The Final Judgment should (a) provide for a comprehensive review by the Department of Justice of the MAC operating
procedures to determine that the existing operating procedures and associated technical financial requirements
do not impose requirements on third party processors, or give MAC control over unnecessary devices or equipment,
that could give MAC the ability to, effectively, exclude competitive processors; and (b) require MAC, in the future,
to publish and circulate to third party processors all proposed changes in the operating regulations at the same time
that such changes are circulated to intercept processors.



Discussion



The goal of the Final Judgment is to open up the processing market to competition. Section IV.E of the Final Judgment
requires defendant EPS to permit third party processors to access the MAC network on the same terms as intercept processors
so long as the third party processor meets the technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors.
It also permits MAC to impose such additional technical criteria, regarding information transmitted and the format
for transmission of such information, as is ``reasonably appropriate for third party ATM processing for unaffiliated
multiple banks.''

In the abstract, requiring MAC to give third party processors access to the MAC network on the same terms as intercept
processors is, potentially, an adequate means to achieve the United States' goal. However, the existing technical,
financial and operating rules and procedures applicable to intercept processors should not be endorsed by entry
of a consent decree unless and until they have been thoroughly reviewed by persons with the requisite expertise.

Experience in numerous industries has shown that, where a dominant service provider controls access to a network
with which competitors must interconnect, the standards and protocol set for interconnection are ripe with potential
for abuse by the dominant network owner. Probably the best known example of such abuse comes from the conduct of AT&T
during the existence of the Bell system monopoly. For example, as discussed in 

Litton Systems, Inc. 

v. 

American Telephone & Telegraph Company

, 487 F. Supp. 942 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), 

aff'd

. 700 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1983), AT&T required all telephone systems using non-Western Electric/Bell equipment
to purchase a protective coupling device from AT&T, and to pay AT&T to install and maintain the device. It
was ultimately determined that the device was not, in fact, needed to protect the AT&T network from harm, but was
designed for anticompetitive reasons. 

See also United States 

v. 

American Tel. & Tel. Co.

, 524 F. Supp. 1336 (D.D.C. 1981). Similar findings were made as to the technical requirements imposed on competitors
such as MCI and Sprint. 

See, e.g., MCI Communications 

v. 

American Tel. & Tel. Co.

, 708 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1983).

The ATM and debit card processing businesses are rife with similar opportunities for dominant networks like MAC to
manipulate interconnection requirements and related financial and operating procedures to exclude competitors
by imposing on third party processors operating rules or technical and financial requirements with little or no legitimate
business purpose_rules and procedures designed to raise the costs to third party processors and thereby frustrate
competition. For example, one of the ``hottest'' technical developments in the field relates to the method of encryption
(or coding) of transactions to ensure their security as the cardholder's request is transmitted from the terminal
to the network to the card issuing institution, and the authorization and transaction instructions are transmitted
through the network, back to the terminal. Currently, MAC and others operate on a ``master key'' system, under which
all transactions from the terminal are given the same code. Many networks have indicated that they intend to change
to a ``DUKPT'' system, where every transaction will be given a unique key. Many processors, however, are not presently
equipped to operate on a DUKPT system, and they will require very substantial lead time (and need to invest substantial
funds) to modify or replace existing equipment. (For example, in the credit card processing industry, the lead time
for implementing changes reflecting technological advances often ranges from 3 to 5 years.)

Security of customer transactions is clearly a legitimate concern of the networks. However, before DUKPT or other
technical advances are implemented, the Department of Justice should have mechanisms in place to ensure the changes
meet legitimate needs and that they are implemented in a pro-competitive manner. Particularly in a business undergoing
rapid technological change, a mechanism is needed both to insure that the rules and regulations of the monopoly provider
are not designed to inhibit competition by other providers using existing technology and, at the same time, insure
that the MAC network be open to competitors using new and technologically superior equipment.
 Accordingly, before the Department of Justice recommends that the current rules governing intercept processors
be applied to third party processors, it should review MAC's technical, financial, and operating rules and determine
that those standards do not have a negative impact on competition.





To ensure compliance by MAC with its obligation under the judgment to impose on third party, unaffiliated, multiple
bank processors only such additional technical criteria as is ``reasonably appropriate,'' and to be sure that all
subsequent modifications and additions to regulations and operating procedures made to keep pace with changing
technology are necessary and do not discriminate against third party processors, the decree should require MAC to
publish and circulate to third party processors for comment such modifications before their enactment. At a minimum,
MAC should be required to make those rules and procedures available to third party processors at the same time that
they are available to intercept processors. Providing third party processors with the right to review and comment
on proposed technical requirements could give third party processors the opportunity to recommend less costly but
equally secure measures (if such measures are available and adequate) and, in any event, would ensure that third party
processors are informed of technical changes in a timely fashion so that they can comply with such changes. These proposed
modifications to the proposed Final Judgment will promote industry self-regulation and assure that third party
processors are not frozen-out by unnecessary technical, financial or operational requirements, or changes made
to those requirements on short notice.

Comment No. 4



The present pricing structure for access by third party processors to the network should be evaluated and modified
to require MAC (a) periodically to publish its pricing schedules; (b) to unbundle its switch fee to third party processors;
and (c) to eliminate the requirement that third party processors be sponsored by a MAC member.



Discussion



Section IV.G prohibits MAC from discriminating in the pricing of branded ATM network access to the MAC network on the
basis of a customer's choice of ATM processor. Specifically, section G.1 of the Final Judgment mandates that third
party processors receive the same volume discounts as intercept processors. Section G.2 provides that royalties
charged to third party processors to switch transactions between member depository institutions not be greater
than the price charged by MAC to switch such transactions. Section G.3 requires MAC to provide branded ATM service
pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule. While these three limitations are helpful in fixing a pricing structure
that reduces barriers to entry by third party processors, the proposed Final Judgment does not go far enough in that
regard. The Department of Justice apparently has not examined the pricing mechanisms by which third party processors
are constrained and has not taken sufficient measures to assure that existing discriminatory pricing practices
have been eliminated.

In the case of ATM transactions, a third party processor is ordinarily assessed a per transaction driving (or switch)
fee, a one time network (or membership) fee and, where the processor is a not a financial institution, it must be sponsored
by a member financial institution and pay that institution a sponsorship fee (which could be a one time or a per transaction
fee). Similarly, in the case of debit POS transactions, a third party processor pays a switch fee, a network (or membership
fee, and a sponsorship fee.

To be certain that the order achieves its goal of eliminating discriminatory pricing and opening up the processing
market to competitors of MAC, the judgment should:

A. Mandate regular publication of MAC's prices, including volume discounts, so as not to discriminate against smaller
competitors.

This is a simple, inexpensive means of policing MAC's obligation to offer non-discriminatory prices pursuant to
a non-discriminatory pricing schedule.

B. Require MAC to unbundle its switch fee.

Currently, branded ATM networks charge third party processors a ``switch fee'' for each transaction utilizing the
network. That per transaction fee is a bundled rate, comprised of a charge to the third party processor for the costs
to the network of electronically transferring the transaction information and a fee that is reimbursed to the card
issuer. The bundled rate has the effect of causing third party processors to bear a disproportionate share of the issuer's
costs.

Charging a unitary fee for bundled services is a classic form of anticompetitive abuse by a monopolist. Causing MAC
to unbundle its switch fee will foster competition by allowing MAC's competitors to decide which services they desire
to purchase and requiring them to pay only for those services actually used.

C. Eliminate the requirement that, in addition to paying an ``acquirer'' membership fee, third party processors
be sponsored by a member financial institution.

In addition to the per transaction switch fee, MAC charges third party processors a membership fee. MAC, however,
prohibits non-depository, third party processors from becoming full-fledged members of MAC. Instead, under the
guise of maintaining the integrity of the MAC network, MAC requires that every third party processor be sponsored
by a MAC member; each sponsoring MAC member, in turn, requires the third party processor to pay a substantial sponsorship
fee. Those requirements, by definition, discriminate against non-depository institutions that act as third party
processors and deter competition in the processing market, without serving any legitimate business need.



Conclusion



In light of the 10-year life of the consent decree, it is critical that the Department of Justice close the loopholes
described above before the court endorses the judgment so that the judgment will keep pace with the changing nature
of the industry, and its rapid technological advances and thus, remain effective into the next century.

the resources needed to promote use of their cards. Old-line retailers are particularly hard-pressed, and those
programs have born the brunt of market retrenchment. New competitors such as specialty stores typically secure the
services of third-party private-label card issuers instead of managing their own store-card programs, so that segment
of the market is gaining on single-store cards.



Major issuers of Visa and MasterCard are as likely to fill the role of third-party issuer as any other entity, and some
of them are scoring remarkable successes. One standout program is the Select card issued by First of America Bank in
partnership with home-improvement retailers such as furniture stores, carpet firms, and home centers. Those merchants
sell the type of big-ticket items that are most likely to need revolving credit, so the profit potential is significant
for the issuing bank. The merchants pay a flat monthly charge for acceptance, so they save money on their discount rates.
And cardholders get a lower APR than most Visa and MasterCard cards command.

Bankruptcy filings continued to take a toll on private-label cards, both proprietary plastic and third-party cards.
Zale Corp.'s bankruptcy filing and liquidation in 1992 eliminated a major portion of the private-label portfolio
at NationsBank, which also ranks as the 10th largest bank card issuer.



BANKS' DIMINISHED MERCHANT ROLE



In the merchant processing business, consolidation is accelerating, with the five largest processors commanding
more than 60% of the market. This part of the credit-card distribution system has come to be dominated by firms not controlled
by banks, a trend that concerns some executives in the banking community. The trend is continuing, with Citicorp leaving
the merchant arena in mid-1992. It sold Citicorp Establishment Services to venture capitalists who also own the industry's
largest independent sales organization.

But the trend has an up-side for some issuers. The growth of third-party processors has helped smaller card issuers
maintain a niche in the market, analysts point out. Those issuers have been relieved of the need to maintain in-house
processing services while still enjoying the efficiencies of scale those processors bring. The biggest third-party
processors also are the most frequently cited merchant and cardholder processors used by the top 250 card issuers:
FDR rates 85 mentions in Chapter 4, and Total System is cited 60 times.

Sheer size enables the largest issuers to process in-house, and efficiencies of scale are getting better for many
of them. Three major bank mergers affected the 10 largest bank card issuers since the directory's third edition was
published. Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the 10th largest a year ago, was merged into Chemical Bank to form the eighth
largest issuer. NCNB and C&S/Sovran combined to form NationsBank. And BankAmerica maintained its position
as the fourth largest card issuer on the strength of its April 1992 merger with Security Pacific Bank.

Mergers will keep the consolidation trend going. Comerica Bank already has merged with Manufacturers National Corp.,
and card operations were consolidated in August 1992. Security Bank & Trust merged with First of America in April
1992, with merger of the respective credit card operations expected by mid-October. On May 2, 1992, Merchants National
Corp. merged with National City Corp., adopting the name National City Indiana in October.

The portfolio sale which drove consolidation in recent years became a non-factor after mid-year 1991. Whether they
return to their old prominence might depend on the overall health of the banking industry. A survey of banking executives
conducted in 1991 found 23% of those with total assets of $5 billion or more expected to sell their card portfolios by
the end of the decade because of a need to raise capital. If capital conditions become more favorable, either through
market forces or regulatory changes, many of those banks could decide to retain their portfolios.



AFFINITY CARDS ON THE WANE



A credit card trend that may have run its course is the affinity card. Affinity programs reported by the 250 largest
card issuers in the 1992 survey totaled 2,654, a moderate improvement from the previous year's 2,404. But if the marketing
efforts of a single issuer, MBNA America, are factored out, a net loss occurred. MBNA lead the industry with 1,530 affinity
programs, but a score of issuers report fewer affinity programs now than a year ago.

All but two of the 250 credit card issuers in Chapter 4 are Visa/MasterCard issues, and the dominance of Visa plastic
continues to grow. In the directory's first edition, 54.5% of those issuer's card were Visa. The following year the
ration jumped to 57.1%., then 57.5%. In this latest survey, the Visa share has climbed to 58.4%.

One other trend not readily apparent in the pages that follow is the decline in the average number of cards per credit-card
account. When the first edition of the directory was published three years ago, the top 250 issuers averaged 1.5 cards
per account. The ratio has steadily declined in the intervening years and know stands at 1.44 cards per account. That
tent is more likely a reflection of the social trend toward more single-person households and greater numbers of women
in the labor force than any concerted effort by card issuers to issue fewer cards per account.

Likewise, the outlook for credit and debit profitability will probably be dictated by economic circumstances beyond
the industry's control. But industry competition will also play a major role, and the chapters in this directory give
the most complete presentation, segment by segment, of who the major competitors are and how they compare to the rest
of the industry.

Chapter 8


The 25 Largest Merchant Acquirers


Consolidation is occurring in every segment of the bank card business, but no where is the pace faster than in the merchant
acquiring business. The 25 largest merchant acquirers presented in last year's edition of the Card Industry Directory
accounted for 48.75% of the Visa/MasterCard volume going through merchants; this year's roster held the merchant
contracts that accounted for 64% of 1992's billings. Concentration was especially pronounced at the top end of the
market, with the 10 largest merchant acquirers representing $148.6 billion in bank card billings_49% of 1992's market,
up from 33.7% in 1991. 
The number of merchant locations served by the leading acquirers did not change appreciably between January 1, 1992,
and January 1, 1993. The aggregate total of 1.6 million was only a 3 percent improvement, or 47,248 locations. But as
the bank card industry expands the utility of Visa and MasterCard cards to include health care providers, grocers,
movie theaters, and restaurants, the composite profile of the bank card merchant is changing. Still, the average
value of credit card transactions in 1992 was virtually unchanged from 1991 at $65.48, the industry's leading merchant
acquirers report.
The most remarkable growth on an individual-acquirer basis occurred at National Bancard Corp., which jumped into
the No. 1 position on the strength of 36% dollar-volume growth. Most of NaBANCO's $10.5 billion dollar gain was the
result of the acquisition of CFC Financial Services' merchant portfolio. Other big gainers in 1992 were NationsBank,
which moved from eighth to fifth on the list; First USA Merchant Services, breaking into the top 10 for the first time
as the sixth largest acquirer; and First Premier Bank, the former First Interstate of South Dakota. First Premier
entered the merchant acquiring business in 1989 and vaulted from the No. 13 position in 1991 to become the tenth largest
acquirer.
Two banks are new to the top 25 this year: National Bank of Detroit and Mercantile Bank. Dropping out of the industry's
upper echelon are CFC Financial and MBNA America.
Information in this chapter was compiled through direct contact with executives at the acquiring organizations.
In situations where the information was unavailable, estimates were made on the basis of consultation with industry
experts.

Debit Card Directory: The Complete Guide for the Debit Card Industry in the United States (

) 

pp. 187-191, 1994 Edition



The first eight chapters in this book describe the debit business as it is. What about the future? What shape will the
industry take in the years leading up to the turn of the century? To answer these questions, we reprint here a major study
published in 1993 by Faulkner & Gray.

The study, ``Debit Card 2000,'' surveyed the 45 largest debit card issuers and the top 35 networks to find out what kind
of growth to expect, what new services and enhancements will arrive, and what developments to look for in national
POS by 2000_just six years away.

Some of the results are surprising, particularly if you've always viewed debit cards as a customer service rather
than a profit center. That's now how issuers and networks in the near future will look at the product. By 2000, they say,
there cold be as many as 1 million POS terminals installed. Visa and MasterCard, meanwhile, predict there'll be 100
million off-line debit cards in force in six years, well beyond today's 15 million.

If your plans depend on solid forecasts for the foreseeable future, the following pages should make useful reading.

Ballinger, senior vice president, expects over 80% will have one by 2000. ``We'll never hit 100%, but I would like,
in theory, to have a card in very customer's hands, ``Ballinger says.



Issuers also expect the percentage of consumers with a debit card who use their card at least once a month to grow in the
next seven years. While only about 25% of the issuers say their activation rates currently average more than 70%, 43%
expect that their rates will exceed 70% by 2000. (See tables 6 and 7.)

``The activation rate continues to creep up, especially as younger users replace older customers,'' says Patricia
Bauer, senior vice president of Minneapolis-based First Bank Systems. U.S. Bancorp's Kresge notes that POS is also
pushing up activation rates with his customers as some who had no use for their debit cards at ATMs find they like using
them at the point of sale.

Like debit cards, new ATM deployment is expected to enjoy only modest growth. About 32% of the networks and 50% of the
issuers expect the number of their ATMs to grow by less than 3% annually, while only 13% of the networks and 5% of the card
issuers expect this growth to exceed 15% annually. (See tables 8 and 9.)

A few networks and banks, however, are expecting more active new ATM deployment, particularly at off-premise locations.
``We have a tremendous amount of corporate relationships where we can put ATMs in work locations,'' says Fifth Third's
Ballinger. ``We're looking at deploying 25 to 30 ATMs a year in the workplace. Some will pay us to install ATMs so they
can get rid of or cut their cashier functions.''

And some banks note they expect to deploy more new ATMs to perform non-traditional applications beyond cash withdrawals
and accepting deposits. A few innovators already have been deploying advanced ATMs which can cash checks, issue account
statements, sell stamps or allow consumers to apply for bank loans. ``The traditional cash withdrawals and deposit-taking
terminals have leveled off,'' says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``But other ATM
applications such as EBT will push ATM installations for expanded functions that will add to the growth of ATMs.''

This projected growth is slightly less than the growth in recent years. In 1993, the number of ATMs in the U.S. grew by
8.6%. It grew by 4.5% in 1992, 4.2% in 1991, 5.9% in 1990 and 4.3% in 1989. (See table 10.) And projected growth is considerably
less than the double-digit growth of the early 1980s.

Despite modest expectations for debit card and ATM growth, networks and issuers have higher expectations for total
EFT transactions. Executives expect the most growth in POS transactions while seeing growth of only 10% or less for
ATM transactions. The result will be significant overall transaction growth.

About 55% of the network executives and 53% of bank card issuers expect their EFT volume growth to exceed 15% annually.
Another 26% of the issuers and 10% of the networks expect growth to be between 10% and 15% annually. (See tables 11 and
12.)

``Between now and the end of the decade, the number of POS transactions will equal the number of ATM transactions,''
says Edward Gough, president of Ohio-based Money Station network. ``POS is now only 5% of our total volume.''

Others also expect POS to lead the growth. ``We will see a lot of transaction volume growth,'' says Olen Thomas, vice
president of Richmond, VA.-based Crestar Bank. ``The POS component of transaction volume could grow by 50% a year
for the next two to three years.''

Despite modest expectations for ATM transaction growth, network executives say it still will be healthy. ``We keep
expecting the rate of growth in ATM transaction volume to slow, but last year it exploded,'' says James Martin, president
of Wisconsin-based Tyme network. ``In POS, we expect a 55% increase in 1993 and we expect ATM volume to continue to grow
10% a year.''

Networks projecting the lowest rate of growth_less than 10%_typically do not offer or plan to offer POS and also do
not have ambitious plans for other new electronic payments programs. These projections would indicate that POS,
which finally seems ready to take off after years of hopeful expectations, will drive EFT volume increases in excess
of the 12% to 14% growth that had been common in recent years. (See table 13.)

Although POS has been growing slowly in recent years, new regional POS programs throughout the country, the advent
of national POS programs, the skyrocketing level of acceptance of debit cards by supermarkets and penetration of
POS into new markets like fast-food restaurants and specialty shops have raised the expectations of both network
and financial institution executives.

ATM Owners


Who owns all those automated-teller machines one sees popping up all over the place? Chances are, the answer is among
this ranking of the top 300 ATM owners in the United States, listed by machines owned as of year-end 1992.
These machine owners control some 47,910 terminals, or 55% of all ATMs. Not all significant ATM deployers are banks.
Among the ranks of machine owners are six non-bank companies: Electronic Data Systems, Affiliated Computer Systems,
Wegmans Food Markets, FIserv, Publix Super Markets, and Delchamps supermarkets.
Each entry also records how many POS terminals the organization owns. As it happens, the top 300 ATM owners also control
58,100, or 54%, of all U.S. POS devices.

EFT Networks






Of course, there is more to debit cards than POS_and the shared regional networks offer it. Here are many of the same
networks from Chapter Two, now ranked according to total transaction volume for September 1993. This ranking thus
includes automated-teller transactions as well as payments at the point of sale, with data on terminals by type_ATM
or POS, including how many ATMS are installed off bank premises in stores, malls, etc._and a breakdown of transactions
into those on ATMs and those on POS terminals. This information is shown for the 50 largest shared regional systems.



Now the value of shared network brands becomes clear. The top-line total-transaction number includes all transactions
deposits, withdrawals, transfers, payments, and balance inquiries) performed on machines hooked into the network
not just those passing through the network's data center. Hence, the number captures a truer sense of the strength
of the network's brand among cardholders than does the number of data-center transactions (which are shown in the
``switch'' line in the transaction analysis).




Another such indicator is the interchange percentage, shown in the transaction analysis. This is the portion of total
volume stemming from cardholders' use of terminals belonging to banks other than their own. Banks' fees for so-called
foreign transactions influence interchange, of course, but the number does give some indication of the extent to
which consumers recognize network marks.




Networks to watch include number-one Star and second-ranked MAC. Star in 1993 became the first network ever to exceed
the 100-million mark in monthly volume. And MAC, which is part of the giant Electronic Payment Services Inc. electronic
banking combine, logged the fastest growth among the top 50, boosting transactions by 78%. This surge was enough to
move the network up from its fourth-place showing in 1992.

POS Networks



When banks began hooking up their automated teller machines to regional electronic-banking networks back in the
1970s, the eventual use of debit cards to buy things in stores was always uppermost in the minds of bank and network managers
alike.

That next step began in the early '80s. One of the first networks to introduce point-of-sale debit was Iowa's Shazam.
In 1985, California's major banks created Interlink, skipping the ATM stage altogether and going straight to POS.

Now at least 25 networks offer POS, and the brand identity, single card bases, and machine-sharing these regional
systems bring to the product are helping fuel its remarkable growth.

This is producing some notable success stories among the networks. The New Jersey-based NYCE network, whose POS program
barely existed two years ago, is installing thousands of terminals a month in supermarkets and other retail locations.
Result: a nearly 600% increase in monthly transactions in one year.

These 25 networks offering POS, along with Maestro, MasterCard's national POS brand, are ranked here by transaction
volume for June 1993, with details on each system's transactions, terminals, switch fees, cards, and merchant concentration.
Interlink, with its massive programs with such merchants as Lucky and Arco, ranks number one, dwarfing second-ranked
Explore, another California network. NYCE's big growth was enough to boost the network into the number 10 spot.

Look for network mergers to thin these ranks, leading to perhaps 10 or so super-regional systems by the end of the decade.
Fewer brands covering more cards, terminals, and territory should mean accelerated growth for POS.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On July 1, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., of Roslyn, New York, proposing to revoke his DEA
Certificate of Registration, AL0713417, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), (4), and (5), and deny any pending applications
for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Lehrman
was no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances, that his continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, and that he had been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a).
The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail and delivered to Dr. Lehrman on July 9, 1994, at his registered location
in Roslyn, New York. No response was received from Dr. Lehrman or anyone purporting to represent him.
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order
under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.57.
The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Lehrman was convicted in the New York State Supreme Court in New York County
of grand larceny in the second degree, conspiracy in the fourth degree, and offering a false instrument for filing
on sixteen occasions. These convictions involved billing for services to the Medicaid program, which services also
included improper prescribing of the Schedule IV controlled substance Valium. On October 20, 1992, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) excluded Dr. Lehrman from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs
for a period of twenty five years. This exclusion was mandatory under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a)
and was due to his conviction of a criminal offense related to the delivery of care under the Medicaid program. On April
9, 1993, the New York Department of Health, Board for Professional Medical Conduct, issued an order revoking Dr. Lehrman's
medical license.
The Administrator has consistently held that termination of a registrant's state authority to handle controlled
substances requires that DEA revoke the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration. 

See Bobby Watts, M.D., 

53 FR 11919 (1987); 

Lawrence R. Alexander, M.D., 

57 FR 22256 (1992).
Dr. Lehrman is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances under
the laws of the state in which he is registered with DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes that it
is not necessary to address the other grounds, including whether Dr. Lehrman's continued registration is consistent
with the public interest.
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Lehrman's registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C.
824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority
vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate
of Registration, AL0713417, previously issued to Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that
any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 30, 1994.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD</USDEPT>








<DOCTITLE>Board Meeting</DOCTITLE>






The process of site-suitability determination, DOE priorities in testing and data collection at Yucca Mountain
and the rationale for those priorities, and views on the role of natural and engineered barriers.






Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board will hold its fall meeting October 12, 1994, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The meeting will be held at the Alexis Park Hotel, 375 East Harmon, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109; Tel (702) 796-3300;
Fax (202) 796-4334. The pubic is welcome to attend the meeting, which will begin at 8:30 A.M. Presentations during
the one-day meeting will address the process of site-suitability determination, the Department of Energy's (DOE)
priorities in testing and data collection and the rationale for those priorities, and views on the role of natural
and engineered barriers, including those form nuclear waste programs outside the United States. Discussions during
the course of the day will focus on the DOE's waste isolation strategy, site-suitability issues (including the use
of expert judgment), and those features, events, and processes that could pose a serious challenge to Yucca Mountain's
viability as the site of a potential repository. A final round-table discussion will explore the role that natural
and engineered barriers should play in assessing site suitability.






The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987
to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of activities undertaken by the DOE in its program to manage the
disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste. In that same legislation, Congress directed
the DOE to characterize a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for its suitability as a potential location for a permanent
repository for the disposal of that waste.






Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning November 28, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External
Affairs, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; Tel: 703-235-4473; Fax 703-235-4495.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>














EDGAR Phase-In to Continue Later This Year 






August 24, 1994. 





The Office of Information Technology (``OIT'') today announced that the phase-in date for mandated filing on the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system for registrants in phase-in Groups CF-05
and IM-03 will be after November 1, 1994. This will afford OIT staff adequate time to complete its analysis of
the data respecting EDGAR's performance that was collected during the Congressionally-mandated six-month test
period and to report to the Commission. It is anticipated that prior to November 1, 1994, the Commission will announce,
approximately 30 days before effectiveness, a schedule setting out the precise phase-in dates for Groups CF-05
and IM-03 and all subsequent phase-in groups. Filers in Groups CF-05 and IM-03 who are prepared to
file electronically prior to mandated phase-in may volunteer to do so by requesting that their phase-in group be changed
to CF-04 or IM-02, as appropriate. At the time a phase-in group change is granted, filers will become subject
to mandated electronic filing rules and all subsequent filings will be required to be filed in electronic format.
Once a registrant is phased in, third parties filing documents such as Schedules 13D or proxy materials with respect
to that registrant also are required to submit such filings electronically. Corporation Finance registrants requesting
phase-in changes should contact Sylvia Reis or Serena Swegle ((202) 942-2940), Mail Stop 3-8, Division of Corporation
Finance, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Investment Management registrants should contact Anthony A.
Vertuno ((202) 942-0591) or Ruth Armfield Sanders ((202) 942-0633), Mail Stop 10-6, Division of
Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Amending Rule 205 (Odd-Lot Orders)</DOCTITLE>




August 24, 1994.



On May 12, 1994 the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 205 (Manner of Executing Odd-Lot Orders).






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34416 (July 21, 1994), 59
FR 38217 (July 27, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.

The Amex is amending Rule 205: (1) To provide that no differential shall be charged on odd-lot order transactions except
for non-regular way trades; (2) to revise the definition of the effective transaction that triggers the execution
of an odd-lot order with respect to certain odd-lot limited orders; and (3) to delete, reposition, or re-number various
provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders.

Under the current provisions of Rule 205, all standard odd-lot market orders, as well as marketable odd-lot limited
orders, are executed with no differential charged.
 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell
marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders as specified in Rule 205(B) and (C).







Under the amendments to Rule 205, the Exchange intends to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders,
except for non-regular way executions, without a differential. Non-regular way trades will include (1) a ``seller's
option'' trade for delivery not less than six business days nor more than sixty days following the day of the contract;
(2) an odd-lot order for cash or ``next day'' delivery, and (3) any order for additional settlement periods as may be
provided under Rule 124 (Types of Bids and Offers). All other odd-lot orders will be executed without a differential.

Odd-lot limited orders must be executed on the first eligible effective transaction. Under the current odd-lot pricing
procedures, the effective transaction for a limited order to buy is the first round lot transaction below the specified
limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Further, the effective transactions for a limited order
to sell marked ``long'' is the first round lot transaction above the specified limit by the amount of the differential
or by a greater amount. Finally, the effective transaction for a limited order to sell marked ``short'' is the first
round lot transaction which is above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount, and
which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price.

Under the amendments to Rule 205, the effective transaction that will trigger the execution of an odd-lot limited
order is a transaction ``at or lower'' than the specified limit for a buy limited order, or ``at or higher'' than the
specified limit for sell limited orders. In addition, for sell limited orders marked ``short,'' the triggering transaction
must also be higher than the last different round lot transaction (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick).

Further, under the amendments, marketable limited orders will continue to be executed in accordance with the procedures
outlined in Rule 205 applicable to market orders. Currently, any order entered as a limited order, which is marketable
at the time it is entered, is treated exactly as though it were entered as a market order.
 Thus, this provision in the amendments is merely a codification of current Exchange practice.

<DOCNO> FR940830-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940830-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the amendments delete provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered. These include
(1) limited orders to buy on the offer, sell on the bid, and those marked ``immediate or cancel''; and (2) limited orders
to buy or sell marked ``or on close.''
 By deleting these provisions, the Amex is discontinuing their eligibility for order entry.





Finally, current provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades will be deleted and subsumed by new Section
C(2) entitled ``Non-Regular Way Trades.'' A differential will be permitted on such executions.


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public. The Commission believes that the proposal's goal, which
is to eliminate odd-lot differentials on all but non-regular way trades and adjust the pricing mechanism accordingly,
should increase the quality of execution and accurate reporting of customer odd-lot market and limited orders. The
Commission also believes that the proposal should further the Commission objective of ensuring that customers receive
the best execution of such orders. As a result of the proposal, the price charged for the execution of systematized
odd-lot orders will reflect the market's price without additional transaction charges.










It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-15) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Crestfunds, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



August 24, 1944.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







applicants: 

CrestFunds, Inc. (the ``Fund''), Capitoline Investment Services Incorporated (the ``Adviser''), and Fidelity
Distributors Corporation (the ``Distributor'').




relevant act sections: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) and rule 22c-1,
and to amend a previous order (the ``Prior Order'') that granted applicants an exemption relief from sections 18(f),
18(g), and 18(i).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY of application: 

Applicants request an amendment to the Prior Order which permits the Fund to offer multiple classes of shares. As amended,
the order would permit the Fund to assess a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of
shares. The order also would let applicants add a conversion feature to their existing multiple class distribution
arrangement.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Fund is an open-end management investment company, which currently consists of ten series. The series represent
interests in three money market portfolios, four bond portfolios, and three equity portfolios (the ``Portfolios'').
The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestar Bank, which is a subsidiary of Crestar Financial Corporation.
The Distributor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp.

2. The Prior Order permits the Fund to issue an unlimited number of classes of shares. The Prior Order recognizes certain
permissible class differences, including: (a) the allocation among classes of certain expenses including 12b-1
fees and shareholder servicing fees, transfer agency fees, blue sky fees and certain other fees; (b) the fact that
classes will vote separately with respect to the classes' 12b-1 plans and/or shareholder services plans; (c)
the exchange privileges of the various classes; and (d) the manner in which each class of shares are designated. The
Fund's existing classes of shares are sold subject to a traditional front-end sales load and/or rule 12b-1 fees.

3. Applicants request an exemption to let them impose a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares and waive the CDSC in certain
cases. Applicants also request an exemption to allow them to offer one or more classes of shares with a conversion feature.
Applicants request that the relief apply to all other investment companies or series thereof that are, or in the future
will be, advised by the Adviser, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser,
or that are, or in the future will be, distributed by the Distributor, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the Distributor and that have or will have the ability to issue classes of shares that are identical
in all material respects to those described in the application. All existing entities that presently intend to rely
on the requested order have been named as applicants.

4. The terms of the CDSC and the circumstances under which it is imposed may vary among the Portfolios and among classes
within a Portfolio. A CDSC may be imposed in combination with an initial sales load, in connection with redemptions
of shares for which an initial sales load was waived, or in connection with redemptions of shares sold at net asset value.
The CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value
of the shares at the time of purchase or redemption. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing capital appreciation
or shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions.

5. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Fund will comply with
the requirements of rule 22d-1. Applicants may provide a credit in the amount of the CDSC to a shareholder who
reinvests in Fund shares within a certain period after redemption. Any credit will be paid by the Distributor or the
Adviser.

6. Shareholders may be permitted to exchange shares subject to a CDSC for shares of the same class of another Portfolio
and for shares of the money market Portfolios. Any exchange privilege will comply with rule 11a-3.

7. Applicants may offer one or more classes of shares subject to a conversion feature. After the expiration of a specified
period, shares of one class (``Purchase Class'') automatically will convert at their net asset value to shares of
another class with different features (``Target Class''). After conversion, the Target Class shares will be subject
to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales
charge and service fee of the Purchase Class.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants believe that the proposal to impose a CDSC is fair, in the public interest and the interest of the Fund's
shareholders, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
the provisions of the Act. Consequently, applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption
from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to the extent necessary
to permit the proposed CDSC arrangement.

2. Applicants also request an amendment to the Prior Order to let them add a conversion feature as a difference between
the classes of shares. Applicants believe that the conversion feature is equitable and will not discriminate against
any group of shareholders.

Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the following conditions may be imposed in any SEC order granting the requested relief.

1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Portfolio will relate
solely to one or more of the following: (a) the method of financing certain class expenses, which are limited to any
or all of the following: (i) transfer agent fees identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class
of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder
reports, prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) SEC and/or Blue Sky
registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required
to support the shareholders of a specific class; (v) directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating
to one class of shares; and (vi) accounting expenses relating to one class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class
pursuant to a shareholder services plan and/or 12b-1 plan (whether an administrative 12b-1 plan or a distribution
and service plan or both) with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect
to the Fund's shareholder services plan and/or any 12b-1 plan (except as set forth in condition 16 below); (d)
the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund;
and (f) the fact that certain classes will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC.

2. The directors of the Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the offering of additional
classes of new shares (the ``Multi-Class System''). The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations
of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail
the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interest of both
the Fund and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors, including a majority of the independent
directors. Any persons authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to
meet class expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review at least quarterly, a written
report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The
directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Distributor and the Adviser will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Distributor and the Adviser, at their
own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. The distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to such standards.

6. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1
(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the shareholder
services plans and any 12b-1 plans and the related service agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged
to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors
to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

8. Dividends paid by the Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount per outstanding share, except that
administrative or service payments made by a class under a plan and any class expenses will be borne exclusively by
that class.

9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered
a report to the applicants that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and
allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review,
will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The
reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1)
of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund
agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request to the Fund for such work
papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director,
the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate
and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of
a System'' and ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted
by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distribution of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.

11. The prospectuses of each class of shares will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other
person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation
with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
with respect to the Multi-Class Systems will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors.

13. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain in the statement of assets and liabilities and the statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of such Portfolio. The information provided
by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value or public offering
price will present each class of shares separately.
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to its administrative
12b-1 plan, distribution and service plan or shareholder services plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
15. Any Purchase Class with a conversion feature will convert into a Target Class on the basis of the relative net asset
values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted
shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III,
Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales
charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
16. If the Fund implements any amendment to a rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class will stop converting into Target Class
shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. If such approval
is not granted, the directors shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares
are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to
the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such Purchase Class shares
previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement
the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase
Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will
convert into New Target Class. A New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief.
Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably
believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with
the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser
and/or the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target
Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and
the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosure in an effective registration statement.
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

<DOCTITLE>TCW Earnings Momentum Limited Partnership, et al.; Notice of Application </DOCTITLE>



August 24, 1994. 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act''). 





APPLICANTS:

 TCW Earnings Momentum Limited Partnership (the ``Partnership''), TCW Funds, Inc. (the ``Company''), TCW Asset
Management Company (``TAMCO''), and TCW Funds Management, Inc. (the ``Adviser''). 




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS:

 Order requested under section 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants request an order that would permit the Partnership to transfer substantially all of its assets and liabilities
to a series of the Company in exchange for the series' shares, which then would be distributed 

pro

 

rata

 to partners of the Partnership. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.





Applicants' Representations 



1. The Partnership is a California limited partnership with an investment objective of seeking capital appreciation
through investment in publicly-traded equity securities. It allows investors to purchase and redeem Partnership
interests (the ``Units'') at net asset value on a monthly basis. The Partnership is not registered under the Act in
reliance on section 3(c)(1) of the Act. The offerings of the Units were structured as private placements under section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Units are sold to institutional investors
and high net worth individuals.

<TEXT>
 

2. TAMCO and the Adviser are wholly-owned subsidiaries of The TCW Group, Inc. TAMCO serves as the sole general partner
and administrator of the Partnership. TAMCO also manages the Partnership's investments.

3. The Company, a Maryland corporation, is a registered open-end investment company formed as a series company. Currently,
the Company offers ten portfolios. The Company proposes to offer a new investment portfolio (the ``Fund''), whose
investment objectives and policies will be substantially similar to those of the Partnership. The Company has entered
into an advisory agreement with the Adviser who will provide investment management services to the Fund that are substantially
the same as the services that TAMCO currently provides to the Partnership. 

4. Applicants propose that, pursuant to an agreement and plan of exchange, the Fund acquire substantially all of the
assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Partnership in exchange for Fund shares (the ``Exchange'').
Prior to the Exchange, information and a prospectus will be delivered to the Partnership's limited partners.

5. Fund shares received by the Partnership will have an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value
of the assets transferred by the Partnership (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund).
Upon consummation of an Exchange, the Partnership will distribute the Fund shares to its partners, with each partner
receiving shares having an aggregate net asset value equivalent to the net asset value of the Units held by such partner
prior to the Exchange (except for the effect of organizational expenses paid by the Fund). The Partnership may retain
assets needed to pay any accrued expenses. The Partnership also may retain assets that the Fund is not permitted to
purchase, or that would be unsuitable for the Fund. Assets retained by the Partnership that are not needed to pay accrued
expenses will be distributed 

pro rata

 to the partners of the Partnership. The Partnership will be liquidated and dissolved following the distribution.


6. The agreement governing the Partnership provides that the Partnership may be converted into a registered investment
company if the general partner determines that a conversion is in the best interest of the Partnership. The agreement
expressly provides that no further approval or consent of the limited partners is required for such conversion, so
long as at least 60 days' advance written notice is provided to the limited partners. Limited partners who do not wish
to participate in the conversation of the Partnership will have adequate opportunity to redeem their Partnership
interests before the conversion occurs.

7. The expenses of the Exchange will be borne by TAMCO. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be
paid in connection with the Exchange. Fund organizational expenses, up to a maximum of $50,000, will be paid by the
Fund and amortized over five years. Fund organizational expenses in excess of $50,000 will be paid by the Adviser.
Any unamortized organizational expenses associated with the organization of a Fund at the time the Adviser withdraws
its initial investment in the Company will be borne by the Adviser and not the Fund.

8. The management fees for the Fund will not exceed the maximum fees currently paid by the Partnership. Applicants
expect that other Fund expenses will be relatively higher than Partnership expenses. This is primarily because of
the increased operating costs of a registered investment company and compliance with additional regulatory requirements.
Through the end of calendar 1994, however, the Adviser will limit annual Fund expenses with the intention of capping
fund expense ratios at levels which would have been incurred during 1994 by the partnership.
9. Prior to an Exchange, certain limited partners may withdraw from the Partnership and participate in a new limited
partnership with similar investment objectives. The new limited partnership will not be registered under the Act
in reliance on section 3(c)(1) thereof, and the new partnership interests will not be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 in reliance on section 4(2) thereof.
10. The Fund's board of directors and TAMCO have considered whether the Exchange will be in the best interests of the
Company and the Partnership, respectively. All of the members of the Fund's board and TAMCO have approved the Exchange
and have concluded that: (a) the Exchange is desirable as a business matter for both the Company and the Partnership;
(b) the Exchange is in the best interests of the Company and the Partnership; (c) the Exchange is reasonable and fair,
does not involve overreaching, and is consistent with the policies of the Act; (d) the Exchange is consistent with
the policies of the Company and the Partnership; and (e) the interests of existing shareholders in the Company and
existing partners will not be diluted as a result of the Exchange. The Exchange will not be effected until the Company
has received a favorable opinion of counsel with respect to the tax consequences of the Exchange.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 17(a) prohibits affiliated persons of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of such
persons, from selling to or purchasing from such company any security or other property. The Partnership may be an
affiliated person of the Company because TAMCO and the Adviser are under common control. Thus, the proposed Exchange
may be prohibited by section 17(a).
2. Section 17(b) of the Act permits the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes
that (a) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with
the policy of the registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the
general purposes of the Act.
3. The Exchange will permit partners to pursue the same investment objectives and policies as shareholders of the
Fund without sacrificing the pass-through tax features of the Partnership. In addition, shareholders of the Fund
will be able to purchase and redeem shares on each business day, as opposed to only once per month as is currently provided
under the Partnership agreement, providing greater liquidity. The Fund expects that operating as a registered investment
company will help encourage net asset growth. For these reasons, among others, applicants believe that the proposed
Exchange meets the section 17(b) standards.

Centralization of Vessel Documentation Activities; Implementation Plan; Public Meetings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meetings; notice of availability.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the first two of a series of public meetings to be held by the Coast Guard to discuss plans to close
vessel documentation offices in 14 cities, and to centralize all vessel documentation activities at a single location.
In addition, it announces availability of the Coast Guard's implementation plan to ensure an orderly transition.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The first two meetings will be held in New Orleans, LA, and Washington, DC. The purpose of the meetings is to discuss
the Coast Guard's implementation plan, and to obtain input from and educate the affected community and general public
with regard to revised procedures and planned innovations. The planned centralization is part of the Coast Guard's
ongoing efforts to provide the maximum service to the maritime community, while seeking to reduce costs.


The implementation plan describes in general terms the steps and procedures which the Coast Guard will follow in achieving
centralization while maintaining full customer service.


Meeting Participation


It is unnecessary to file a written request to participate in the meeting. The Coast Guard will discuss its implementation
plan and solicit input from the public for the purpose of ensuring an orderly transition to the central site. Individuals
will also be afforded an opportunity to leave informal written comments on specific areas of concern.

Following the public meetings, the Cost Guard will consider the input from the public and may revise its implementation
plan accordingly. 


Background 


Vessel Documentation is a form of national registration for vessels, which among other things, serve to establish
a vessel's nationality and qualification to be employed in specified trades. The benefits of documenting a vessel
are practical, legal and financial. 
The salient practical benefit of documentation is to ensure unencumbered interstate and international commerce.
The existence of a Federal system of documentation serves to preempt state numbering and regulatory schemes, with
the result that a vessel operated under a Federal endorsement is ensured access to state waters for various activities.
Another practical benefit of Federal documentation stems from the preferential customs and tax treatment accorded
to ``vessels of the United States''. Established national policy seeks to promote the existence of an American merchant
marine as a resource to be drawn upon in time of emergency or war. To the extent that documentation is a condition precedent
to the receipt of preferential customs and tax treatment, it serves as a tool to promote national policy interests.

The legal benefits of documentation include establishing conclusive evidence of nationality for international
purposes, thereby conferring the privileges, protections, and immunities contemplated by long-standing international
law and custom. Vessels on the high seas which are not registered in a national system may be deemed to be ``stateless''
vessels, subject to boarding by foreign authorities without restriction. Another legal benefit conferred by documentation
is the establishment of entitlement to engage in certain restricted trades and employments, such as coastwise or
Great Lakes trade, the U.S. fisheries, towing, and dredging. 
The major financial benefit conferred by documentation is preferred mortgage financing. The availability of capital
for maritime financing often hinges upon the existence of the preferred mortgage as security for loans against vessels.
Unlike so-called ``ordinary mortgages,'' preferred mortgages rise to the level of a maritime lien, thereby taking
precedence over non-maritime liens as well as maritime liens which arise after perfection of the preferred mortgage.
Preferred mortgages, which are enforceable against the vessel in Federal court wherever the vessel is found are critical
not only for large commercial vessels, but also provide protection for mortgages of recreational vessels, thereby
helping to ensure the continued existence of the recreational vessel building industry in the U.S. 


Purpose of Centralization 


The vessel documentation program has grown exponentially during the course of recent years. The Coast Guard has identified
centralization as a means by which it can meet the challenge of maintaining and improving levels of service to its customers
through significant gains in functional and administrative practices. No longer will it be necessary for members
of industry, law enforcement officials, and the boating public to make inquiries at multiple points to receive information
on documented vessels. Mortgagees and lien claimants will have a single point for filing instruments. Inconsistencies
that result from interpretation of statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements at multiple points would be eliminated.
Workloads will be evenly distributed so that backlogs caused by seasonal fluctuations in maritime activities could
be reduced or eliminated. The impact of absence of personnel due to retirement, illness, or unforeseen circumstances
will be minimized. 
With all records consolidated, it will be feasible to develop a system permitting the public to file instruments through
electronic means, thus enhancing vessel financing by permitting instantaneous perfection of mortgages and related
instruments. 
Management overhead will be reduced through better space management by eliminating duplicate facilities in 14 locations.
Moreover, most offices are currently located in high cost areas; consolidation will make it possible to locate all
facilities in an area with lower real estate costs for the government. 


Meetings 


The meetings will be held in New Orleans, LA; Washington, DC; New York, NY; Miami, FL; St. Louis, MO; Los Angeles, CA;
and Seattle, WA. 
The meetings are open to the public and will convene as follows: 
On September 7, 1994, from 9 a.m. to noon in Room 1120, Hale Boggs Federal Building, 501 Magazine Street, New Orleans,
LA, 70130. 
On September 9, 1994, from 9 a.m. to noon in Room 2415, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington,
DC 20593-0001. 
The dates and addresses for the remaining meetings will be announced in a future edition of the 

Federal Register

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Research and Special Programs Administration, (RSPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Pipeline User Fee Assessments.








Section 60301 of Title 49, United States Code
, authorizes the assessment and collection of pipeline user fees to fund the pipeline safety activities conducted
under 49 U.S.C. 60101 

et seq.

 The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) assesses each operator of regulated interstate and intrastate
natural gas transmission pipelines (as defined in 49 CFR part 192), and hazardous liquid pipelines carrying petroleum,
petroleum products, anhydrous ammonia and carbon dioxide (as defined in 49 CFR part 195), a share of the total Federal
pipeline safety program costs in proportion to the number of miles of pipeline each operator has in service. Operators
of liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities are assessed based on total storage capacity (as defined in 49 CFR part 193).






This notice announces that the fiscal year 1994 user fee assessments for pipeline facilities were mailed to operators
on about July 29, 1994.


The fees assessed for Natural Gas Transmission, Hazardous Liquid and LNG are as indicated below:


Natural gas transmission pipelines: $44.49 per mile (based on 289,674 miles of pipeline).


Hazardous liquid pipelines: $32.33 per mile (based on 157,671 miles of pipeline).


LNG is based on the number of plants and total storage capacity:








In accordance with the provisions of 49 U.S.C.  60301, Departmental resources were taken into consideration
for determining total program costs.


The apportionment ratio between gas and liquid, as shown below, is a result of the increased program resources dedicated
to the hazardous liquid program due to: (1) environmental requirements following passage of the Pipeline Safety
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-508); and (2) the Secretary's environmental action plan instituted following a serious
hazardous liquid spill in Fairfax County, Virginia in March 1993.







In accordance with the regulations of the Department of the Treasury, user fees are due 30 days after the date of the
assessment. Interest, penalties, and administrative charges will be assessed on delinquent debts in accordance
with 31 U.S.C. 3717.

 Notice of availability and request for comment on contaminated sediment management strategy

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed and is requesting public comments on a comprehensive,
multimedia Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy. The proposed Strategy describes specific actions that
EPA will take to reduce environmental and human health risks associated with contaminated sediment. The Strategy
does not propose new regulation. EPA is acting, under existing statutory and regulatory authority, to implement
policies to consistently assess, prevent, and remediate contaminated sediment. Because the proposed Strategy
is a unique plan of action developed to address a significant national environmental problem, and to streamline decision-making
within and among EPA programs, the Agency is taking the unusual step of requesting public comment on this internal
EPA work plan.

EPA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy_Reinventing Government to Streamline Decision-Making 






Contaminated sediment poses ecological and human health risks in many watersheds throughout the United States.
In these watersheds, sediment serves as a contaminant reservoir from which fish and bottom dwelling organisms can
accumulate toxic compounds and pass them up the food chain. Sediment contaminants can be passed to larger fish, birds,
and mammals until they accumulate to levels that may be toxic to humans. Toxic chemicals in sediment come from discharges
of industrial waste and sewage; stormwater runoff from waste dumps, city streets and farms, and air pollutants contained
in rainwater. The magnitude of the toxics problem in the United States is evidenced in more than 1,200 State advisories
that have been issued against consuming fish that have accumulated toxic bioaccumulative contaminants from sediment
and other sources. 

More than ten Federal statutes provide authority to many EPA program offices to address the problem of contaminated
sediment. This has resulted in fragmented, and in some cases duplicative, efforts to complete the necessary research,
technology development, and pollution control activities required to effectively manage contaminated sediment.
Often it has been difficult for EPA programs to agree upon the fundamental question of whether sediment at a particular
site poses ecological or human health risks. EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy was developed
to streamline decision-making within and among the Agency's program offices by promoting and ensuring: the use of
consistent sediment assessment practices, consistent consideration of risks posed by contaminated sediment,
the use of consistent approaches to management of contaminated sediment risks, and the wise use of scarce resources
for research and technology development. 



Goals of the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy 



EPA's proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy describes actions that the Agency will take to accomplish
the following four strategic goals: (1) Prevent further sediment contamination that may cause unacceptable ecological
or human health risks; (2) When practical, clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's
waterbodies or their uses, or that causes other significant effects on human health or the environment; (3) Ensure
that sediment dredging and dredged material disposal continue to be managed in an environmentally sound manner;
(4) develop and consistently apply methodologies for analyzing contaminated sediments. 



What the Strategy Does 



The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy is comprised of six component sections: assessment, prevention,
remediation, dredged material management, research, and outreach. In each section, EPA describes actions that
the Agency will take to accomplish the four broad strategic goals.

<TEXT>
 

In the assessment section of the Strategy EPA proposes that Agency program offices all use standard sediment toxicity
test methods and chemical-specific sediment quality criteria to determine whether sediments are contaminated.
Actions that EPA will take to develop a national inventory of sites and sources of sediment contamination (the National
Sediment Inventory) are described in the assessment section of the proposed Strategy. The National Sediment Inventory
will be used by EPA to target sites for contaminated sediment assessment, prevention, and remediation. These assessment
actions will enable EPA to focus on cleaning up the most contaminated waterbodies, and ensuring that further sediment
contamination is prevented. 

EPA's plan to stop sediment contaminants from reaching the environment is described in the prevention section of
the proposed Strategy. In order to regulate the use of pesticides and toxic substances that accumulate in sediment,
EPA proposes the use of acute sediment toxicity tests to support registration of chemicals under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. In the prevention section of the Strategy EPA
also proposes: developing effluent guidelines for industries that discharge sediment contaminants in significant
amounts; using pollution prevention policies to reduce or eliminate sediment contamination resulting from noncompliance
with permits; preparing guidelines for design of new chemicals to reduce bioavailability and partitioning of toxic
chemicals to sediment; and implementing point and nonpoint source controls that will protect sediment quality.
EPA's prevention actions will stop further contamination of sediment and reduce ecological and human health risks.


In the remediation section of the Strategy EPA proposes using multiple statutes to require contaminated sediment
remediation by parties responsible for pollution. These statutes include the Comprehensive Emergency Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act
(CWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Oil Pollution Act. EPA states in
the proposed Strategy, however, that the Agency will not proceed with a clean-up if a combination of pollution prevention
and source controls will allow the sediments to recover naturally in an acceptable period of time. EPA's remediation
actions will clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's waterbodies. 

In the dredged material management section of the proposed Strategy, EPA discusses the development of technical
guidance regarding dredged material testing, dredged material disposal site selection, and disposal alternatives.
EPA actions described in the proposed Strategy will ensure continued disposal of dredged material in an environmentally
sound manner. 

In the research section of the Strategy, EPA proposes a program of investigative research that is needed to: develop
and validate new chemical-specific sediment criteria and other sediment assessment methods; improve EPA's understanding
of the transfer of sediment contaminants through the food chain; and develop and evaluate a range of technologies
for remediating contaminated sediments. EPA's proposed research program will support improved assessment, prevention,
and remediation of contaminated sediment. 

The outreach section of the proposed Strategy describes actions that EPA will take to demonstrate, through public
involvement, the Agency's commitment to, and accountability for, sediment management efforts. EPA will produce,
and make available to the public, regular status reports on sediment management activities. 



Next Steps Toward Implementation of a Federal Agency Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy 



EPA will begin to track activities of the Agency's program offices as they implement the Contaminated Sediment Management
Strategy. However, EPA envisions that this internal strategy will also be the keystone of a much larger Federal Government
strategy for the management of contaminated sediment. The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 92) requires
a National Contaminated Sediment Task Force to advise the Federal Government on the extent and severity of sediment
contamination; sediment restoration methods and technologies; prevention and source control measures; and long-term
disposal sites for contaminated dredged material. The EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the Army will convene
the Task Force and submit the Agency's Strategy to the Task Force for use in developing a Federal agency contaminated
sediment management strategy. The Task Force can build upon EPA's coordinated research program, the research of
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
and other Federal agencies to improve methodologies for measuring ecological and human health risks from contaminated
sediment. 

EPA's National Sediment Inventory is a repository of sediment monitoring data generated by Federal agencies to identify
contaminated sediment sites. This data base can be used by Federal, State, and local agencies to focus their pollution
prevention and remediation efforts on the worst sites of sediment contamination. 

EPA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses coordination of EPA Regional and Headquarters roles
in the management of dredged material, and describes ongoing regulatory development activities related to dredged
material management. 

The Strategy will help facilitate the coordination of dredged material management activities among Federal agencies
and nongovernmental organizations. Coordination of dredged material management activities has been called for
in the May 1994 options paper drafted by the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Dredging Process. The Working
Group was convened by the Secretary of Transportation in the Fall of 1993. The Group has held a series of outreach sessions
throughout the country to solicit ideas on improving the dredging process. The Working Group identified a number
of options to improve the dredging process. Some of these options include: enhanced research and monitoring to improve
dredged material disposal decisionmaking, identification of opportunities to control sources of sediment contaminants,
and effective education and communication with the public on the risks and impacts associated with dredged material
disposal. The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses all of these issues. It describes a
plan for research on interpretation of bioaccumulation and chronic toxicity tests and dredged material disposal
site assessment. It provides a plan for identi
