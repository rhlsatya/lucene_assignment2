State.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29185-29186, Docket No. 94-047-1), we amended the tuberculosis regulations
in 9 CFR part 77 by removing New York from the list of modified accredited States in  77.1 and adding it to the list
of accredited-free States in that section. 
Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 5, 1994. We did not receive any comments.
The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In a direct final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36024-36026, Docket No. 94-014-1), we notified the public of our intent to
amend the animal importation regulations by adding the Greater Cincinnati International Airport in Covington,
KY, as a limited port of entry for certain birds. We also notified the public that we intended to make several nonsubstantive
changes to correct errors in the regulations concerning importation of birds. 
We solicited comments concerning the direct final rule for a 30-day period ending August 15, 1994. We stated that the
effective date of the proposed amendment would be 60 days after publication of the direct final rule in the 

Federal Register

, unless we received written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments by the close of
the comment period. 
We received neither written adverse comments nor written notice of intent to submit adverse comments by that date.
Therefore, the direct final rule will become effective on September 13, 1994, as scheduled.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Summary Report on the Status of Petitions for Rulemaking; Frequency



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reduce the frequency of the summary report
on the status of petitions for rulemaking, which is included in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

, from quarterly to semiannually. This action is necessary because the NRC has reduced the publication of the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 from quarterly to semiannually as the status of rulemaking actions and petitions for rulemaking is not subject to
frequent change. The final rule reduces the level of NRC staff effort, paperwork, and distribution costs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24371), the NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend 10 CFR 2.802(g) to reduce the
frequency of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking from quarterly to semiannually. This report,
which was developed in response to a petition for rulemaking (PRM-2-4), appears as part of the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

. The 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 is a compilation of all rules on which the NRC has recently completed action, has proposed action, or is considering
action, and all petitions for rulemaking that have been received by the Commission and are pending disposition.

The NRC prepares and submits an agenda of its rulemaking activity for inclusion in the 

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

, which is updated semiannually and published in the 

Federal Register

. The NRC meets the public information requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602) and Executive
Order 12866 through its participation in the 

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

. The 

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

 contains the same information concerning NRC rulemaking activity that is published in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

.



Public Comment



The comment period for the proposed amendment closed June 10, 1994. The NRC received two public comments on the proposed
action. Both commenters indicated their support for the reduction in the administrative burden and publication
costs that would result from the reduced frequency of publication. The commenters also indicated that they would
welcome the availability of the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 through electronic access.

One commenter expressed concern that the rule would be implemented before the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 is made available through electronic communications. The NRC staff is continuing to explore the most appropriate
alternatives for making the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 available electronically. When the most appropriate vehicle is selected and implemented, the NRC will announce
the electronic availability of the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 in the 

Federal Register

. The NRC notes that, as is current practice, an interested person may obtain information concerning NRC rulemaking
procedures or the status of any rule contained in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 by contacting the Rules Review and Directives Branch, (301) 415-7158. Persons outside the Washington, DC,
metropolitan area may call toll-free 800-368-5642. For further information on the substantive content
of any rule listed in the agenda, a person may contact the individual listed under the ``Agency Contact'' heading for
that rule.

In addition, on June 8, 1994, the 

Federal Register

 became available on Internet in a multitiered subscription service. This electronic version captures the 

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

, which is published in the 

Federal Register

. The 

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

 includes a section on the status of NRC's rulemakings.

One commenter expressed opposition to the proposed rule if it would cause delays in the processing of new petitions
received by the NRC. The NRC notes that the processing of petitions for rulemaking is in no way related to the frequency
with which the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 is published. Therefore, the adoption of this rule would not cause any delays in processing new petitions received
by the NRC.



The Final Rule



The content and the status of the rulemaking actions and petitions for rulemaking summarized in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 do not change frequently enough to justify a quarterly publication. Therefore, the NRC will publish the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

 in January and July of each year. Section 2.802(g), concerning the frequency of the status of petitions for rulemaking,
is revised to reflect this change. The NRC will continue to publish an updated agenda of its rulemaking actions in the


Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations

 each April and October.



Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion



The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement



This final rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).



Regulatory Analysis



The NRC has not prepared a regulatory impact analysis for this final rule because it is an administrative action that
would reduce the frequency of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking, as included in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

, from quarterly to semiannually.



Regulatory Flexibility Certification



As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule does not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is an administrative action that
reduces the frequency of the summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking, as included in the 

NRC Regulatory Agenda

, from quarterly to semiannually. This action would have no economic impact on any NRC licensee, including small entities.

Backfit Analysis



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and, therefore, that a
backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would
impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).



List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 2



Administrative practice and procedure, Antitrust, Byproduct material, Classified information, Environmental
protection, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalties, Sex discrimination, Source material,
Special nuclear material, Waste treatment and disposal.




For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the following amendment to 10 CFR

Foreign Gifts and Decorations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends regulations on foreign gifts and decorations, so that the definition of ``minimal value''
and other specific dollar figures used with respect to foreign gifts and decorations reflect changes in the consumer
price index.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

I. Background 



Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution provides that no person holding any office of profit or trust under
the United States shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept any present, emolument, office, or title, of
any kind whatever, from any foreign state. In the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act (Act) (5 U.S.C. 7342), Congress
consented to an exception to the general Constitutional rule against the acceptance of gifts or decorations from
foreign governments by Federal employees. Among other things, the statute allows employees to accept gifts of ``minimal
value'' tendered as souvenirs or as marks of courtesy. 

``Minimal value'' is defined in the Act, as amended, as a retail value in the United States of $100 or less, but the Act
provides that ``minimal value'' shall be redefined periodically in regulations prescribed by the Administrator
of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for
the immediately preceding three-year period. The authority to redefine the term ``minimal value'' was effective
on January 1, 1981. The Act also provides that, a Federal employing agency may, by regulation, define ``minimal value''
to be less than the value established under the foregoing provision. 

There is also a limitation on the use of appropriated funds for the purchase of gifts for foreign individuals. Effective
September 30, 1977, no appropriated funds, other than funds from the ``Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular
Service'' account of the Department of State, may be used to purchase any tangible gift of more than minimal value,
as defined in the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act, for any individual unless the gift is approved by the Congress
(22 U.S.C. 2694). 

In 1980 the Department of Energy promulgated regulations regarding the acceptance by Department employees of gifts
and decorations from foreign governments and the use of appropriated funds for the purchase of tangible gifts for
a foreign individual. The Department's Foreign Gifts and Decorations regulations currently provide, at 10 CFR 1050.103(e),
that ``minimal value'' means a retail value of $100 or less. This provision does not reflect changes in the definition
of ``minimal value'' contained in the regulations promulgated by the General Services Administration. At the time
this regulation was promulgated, the definition of ``minimal value'' was not indexed. Furthermore, Subpart D of
these regulations, Gifts to Foreign Individuals, sets a $100 ceiling, but fails to incorporate the term ``minimal
value'' in establishing allowable purchases of tangible gifts for any foreign individuals. 


This rule will redefine ``minimal value'' to be the value prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, in
coordination with the Secretary of State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index, thus, making it unnecessary
for the Department to issue a new rule each time the definition changes due to an increase or decrease in the consumer
price index. Further, it will apply the term ``minimal value'' to the value of gifts allowable for presentation to
foreign individuals. 

This rulemaking involves a matter relating to agency management or personnel, affecting a regulation that only applies
to Department of Energy employees. Furthermore, the rule would relieve a substantive restriction that previously
was placed upon Department of Energy employees. Accordingly, the Department has determined that a general notice
of proposed rulemaking is not required (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)), and is making this rule effective immediately (5 U.S.C.
553(d)(1)). 



II. Review Under Executive Order 12866



Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 



III. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), it is hereby certified that the final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the
Act. It is related solely to internal agency organization, management, or personnel. 




IV. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 



The Department has determined that the final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, because it is a strictly procedural rulemaking within the meaning of paragraph
A6 of Appendix A to subpart D of 10 C.F.R. part 1021. 



V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act



This final rule does not impose a ``collection of information'' requirement, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(4).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued to Yingling Aircraft, Inc. Wichita, Kansas for a Supplemental Type Certificate
(STC) on the Cessna Models 401, 402, 414A, 421, and 425 airplanes. These airplanes will have novel and unusual design
features when compared to the state of technology envisaged in the applicable airworthiness standards. These novel
and unusual design features include the installation of electronic displays for which the applicable regulations
do not contain adequate or appropriate airworthiness standards for the protection of these systems from the effects
of high intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that
the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to the airworthiness standards
applicable to these airplanes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety, and, thus,
was not proceeded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on these special conditions.
Interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the
Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted
will be available in the rules docket for examination by interested parties, both before and after the closing date
for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments, submitted in response
to this request, must include a self-addressed and stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments
to Docket No. 121CE.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.


Background


On July 21, 1994, Yingling Aircraft, Inc. Post Office Box 9248, Wichita, Kansas 67277, made an application to the FAA
for a supplemental type certificate (STC) for the Cessna Models 401, 402, 414A, 421, and 425 airplanes. The proposed
modification incorporates a novel or unusual design feature, such as digital avionics consisting of an electronic
flight instrument system (EFIS), that is vulnerable to HIRF external to the airplane.


Type Certification Basis


The type certification basis for the Cessna Models 401, 402, 414A, 421, and 425 Airplanes is given in Type Certification
Data Sheet No. A7CE plus the following:  23.1301 of Amendment 23-20;   23.1309 and 23.1311
of amendment 23-41; and  23.1322 of Amendment 23-43; exemptions, if any; and the special conditions
adopted by this rulemaking action.

Discussion





The FAA may issue and amend special conditions, as necessary, as part of the type certification basis if the Administrator
finds that the airworthiness standards, designated according to  21.101(b), do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards because of novel or unusual design features of an airplane. Special conditions are prescribed under
the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special
conditions are normally issued according to  11.49, after public notice, as required by   11.28

Yingling Aircraft, Inc., plans to incorporate certain novel and unusual design features into an airplane for which
the airworthiness standards do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for protection from the effects
of HIRF. These features include electronic systems, which are susceptible to the HIRF environment, that were not
envisaged by the existing regulations for this type of airplane.








Protection of Systems From High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)





Recent advances in technology have given rise to the application in aircraft designs of advanced electrical and electronic
systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. Due to the use of sensitive solid state
advanced components in analog and digital electronics circuits, these advanced systems are readily responsive
to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the HIRF. The HIRF can degrade electronic
systems performance by damaging components or upsetting system functions.






Futhermore, the HIRF environment has undergone a transformation that was not foreseen when the current requirements
were developed. Higher energy levels are radiated from transmitters that are used for radar, radio, and television.
Also, the number of transmitters has increased significantly. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness
of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment through cockpit window apertures
is undefined.





The combined effect of the technological advances in airplane design and the changing environment has resulted in
an increased level of vulnerability of electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight
and landing of the airplane. Effective measures against the effects of exposure to HIRF must be provided by the design
and installation of these systems. The accepted maximum energy levels in which civilian airplane system installations
must be capable of operating safely are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. These
special conditions require that the airplane be evaluated under these energy levels for the protection of the electronic
system and its associated wiring harness. These external threat levels, which are lower than previous required values,
are believed to represent the worst case to which an airplane would be exposed in the operating environment.




These special conditions require qualification of systems that perform critical functions, as installed in aircraft,
to the defined HIRF environment in paragraph 1 or, as an option to a fixed value using laboratory tests, in paragraph
2, as follows:




(1) The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical and
electronic systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the
HIRF environment defined below:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940831-0-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940831-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




or,



(2) The applicant may demonstrate by a system test and analysis that the electrical and electronic systems that perform
critical functions can withstand a minimum threat of 100 volts per meter, peak electrical field strength, from 10
KHz to 18 GHz. When using this test to show compliance with the HIRF requirements, no credit is given for signal attenuation
due to installation.

A preliminary hazard analysis must be performed by the applicant, for approval by the FAA, to identify electrical
and/or electronic systems that perform critical functions. The term ``critical'' means those functions whose failure
would contribute to, or cause, a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the
airplane. The systems identified by the hazard analysis that perform critical functions are candidates for the application
of HIRF requirements. A system may perform both critical and non-critical functions. Primary electronic flight
display systems, and their associated components, perform critical functions such as attitude, altitude, and airspeed
indication. The HIRF requirements apply only to critical functions.

Compliance with HIRF requirements may be demonstrated by tests, analysis, models, similarity with existing systems,
or any combination of these. Service experience alone is not acceptable since normal flight operations may not include
an exposure to the HIRF environment. Reliance on a system with similar design features for redundancy as a means of
protection against the effects of external HIRF is generally insufficient since all elements of a redundant system
are likely to be exposed to the fields concurrently.



Conclusion



In view of the design features discussed for the Cessna Models 401, 402, 414A, 421, and 425 Airplanes, the following
special conditions are issued. This action is not a rule of general applicability and affects only those applicants
who apply to the FAA for approval of these features on these airplanes.

The substance of these special conditions has been subject to the notice and public comment procedure in several prior
rulemaking actions. For example, the Dornier 228-200 (53 FR 14782, April 26, 1988), the Cessna Model 525 (56
FR 49396, September 30, 1991), and the Beech Model 200, A200, and B200 airplanes (57 FR 1220, January 13, 1992). It is
unlikely that additional public comment would result in any significant change from those special conditions already
issued and commented on. For these reasons, and because a delay would significantly affect the applicant's installation
of the system and certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined that prior public notice
and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these special conditions without
notice. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

 However, as previously indicated, interested persons are invited to comment on these special conditions if they
so desire.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Aircraft Engines
(GEAE) CT7 series turboprop engines, that currently requires a one-time ultrasonic inspection of a suspect population
of propeller shafts for metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. This amendment
extends the compliance time for the required ultrasonic inspection on certain propeller shafts. This amendment
is prompted by information indicating that the equipment necessary to perform the ultrasonic inspection is less
available than originally assumed. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the propeller
shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 8, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 94-15-01,
Amendment 39-8972 (59 FR 36930, July 20, 1994), applicable to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) CT7
series turboprop engines, to require a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange outer diameter
(OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore on a suspect population of propeller shafts for subsurface metallurgical
defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. That action was prompted by the determination that
certain propeller shafts may have a metallurgical defect that could cause separation of the propeller from the propeller
shaft. The FAA's investigation has revealed this population of propeller shafts may contain a metallurgical defect
known as a pipe inclusion, which developed during manufacture of the shaft. This defect typically forms during the
process of melting the ingot used to form the shaft and positions itself at either end of the ingot. During this phase
of the manufacturing process cropping both ends of the ingot normally ensures complete removal of such defects. The
FAA has determined, however, that for five heat lots of material, pipe inclusions may not have been completely removed
from the material used to form the propeller shaft. The FAA has determined that suspect material was used to manufacture
approximately 326 propeller shafts. 


The FAA received a report of a propeller separating from a SAAB Aircraft S340 series aircraft inflight following severe
vibration. The FAA's investigation revealed that the propeller shaft separated due to a pipe inclusion defect positioned
in a high stress location of the propeller shaft. That defect initiated a crack which propagated to failure. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from
the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft. 
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has determined that ultrasonic inspection equipment was assumed to be more available
than has proven to be, based on input received by the manufacturer. The manufacturer reported that there are many operators
that would experience difficulty gaining access to the ultrasonic inspection equipment in a timely manner given
the current AD's compliance requirements, which could result in unscheduled grounding of aircraft. Therefore,
the FAA is extending the compliance time for ultrasonic inspection of those propeller shafts first identified by
borescope inspection in paragraph (b) of this AD to be suspect. In the current AD, paragraph (b) requires operators
to ultrasonically inspect suspect propeller shafts identified by borescope inspection prior to further flight.
This supersedure will extend the compliance time for ultrasonic inspection to the next shop visit following the borescope
inspection, or October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. This compliance time is identical to the compliance time
described in paragraph (a) of this AD, applicable to propeller shafts already suspected to have a metallurgical defect.
By matching the compliance time of paragraph (b) of this AD to paragraph (a) of this AD, there is no reduction in the level
of airworthiness of the inspection requirements of this AD. 
In addition, the FAA has revised the shop visit definition described in paragraph (c) of this AD to eliminate the separation
of propeller criterion, which could lead to forced unscheduled ultrasonic inspections of the propeller shaft without
ultrasonic inspection equipment available, and to specify the induction of the propeller gearbox into the overhaul
shop rather than the engine, because it is not necessary to remove the engine to perform the inspections required by
this AD. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GEAE (CT7-TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72-350,
Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft
flange OD fillet radius and inner diameter ID bore for detection of subsurface defects. In addition, Table 3 of this
SB lists by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) a certain population of suspect propeller shafts to be identified
by internal markings during a one-time borescope inspection. Those propeller shafts with markings identified as
suspect in accordance with this SB must be ultrasonically inspected the next shop visit following the borescope inspection,
or October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. Since the inspection procedures have not changed in Revision 3 of GEAE
(CT7-TP Series) SB No. A72-350, inspections performed in accordance with previous revisions of this
SB constitute acceptable alternate methods of compliance to the inspections required by this AD. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
this AD supersedes AD 94-15-01 to require a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange
OD fillet radius and ID bore on a suspect population of propeller shafts for subsurface metallurgical defects, and
if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with
the service bulletin described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-ANE-07.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes two existing airworthiness directives (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model
DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military) airplanes and certain Model MD-11 series airplanes,
that currently require inspections to determine the serial numbers and to detect defects in the upper and lower lock
links on the 
nose landing gear (NLG), and rework or replacement of any defective link with a serviceable link. This amendment requires
additional inspections and provides optional terminating action for those inspections. This amendment is prompted
by additional reports of defects found on links that are required to be inspected by the existing AD's. The actions
specified in this AD are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In April 1994, the FAA issued AD 94-09-01, amendment 39-8889 (59 FR 18722, April 20, 1994), applicable
to McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes, and AD 94-09-17, amendment 39-8906 (59
FR 23144, May 5, 1994), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military)
airplanes. These AD's require inspections to determine the serial numbers and to detect defects in the upper and lower
lock links on the nose landing gear (NLG), and rework or replacement of any defective link found. Both actions were
prompted by a report of cracking and subsequent failure of an upper lock link on the center landing gear (CLG) on a McDonnell
Douglas Model MD-11 series airplane; the 
cracking and failure were attributed to forging defects in the lock links. 



The CLG lower lock links, NLG upper lock links, and NLG lower lock links are similar in design to CLG upper lock links
and are manufactured by the same forging supplier; therefore, these lock links may have the same forging defects.
These lock links also may be installed on Model DC-10 series airplanes and KC-10A (military) airplanes.
Consequently, AD 94-09-17 was issued to address the lock links installed on Model DC-10 series airplanes
and KC-10A (military) airplanes. 

Failure of the lock links on the CLG would result in collapse of the CLG; collapse of the CLG does not present an unsafe
condition. Cracking and subsequent failure of the NLG lock links, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the
NLG, which could reduce controllability of the airplane during takeoff or landing. The actions required by AD 94-09-01
and AD 94-09-17 are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG. 

Since the issuance of those AD's, the FAA has received reports of two additional defective lock links with three cracks
that have been attributed to forging defects. These defective lock links were found on the NLG's on Model DC-10
and MD-11 series airplanes during accomplishment of the inspections required by the existing AD's. Subsequently,
the FAA has determined that defects in the lock links may exist as a result of improperly accomplished fluorescent
penetrant inspections of the entire lock link during manufacturing. After manufacture of a lock link, its material
is etched and a fluorescent penetrant inspection is performed to detect forging defects. The fluorescent penetrant
inspections accomplished on the affected lock links were performed without accomplishment of the etching process.
Forging defects in these lock links could result in eventual failure of the lock link and subsequent collapse of the
NLG.

The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Alert Service 
Bulletin A32-238 and MD-11 Alert Service Bulletin A32-47, both dated July 15, 1994, that describe
procedures for visual inspections to determine the serial numbers of the upper and lower lock links on the NLG. The
alert service bulletins also describe three phases of inspections: 

1. Phase I inspections involve an on-aircraft eddy current inspection to detect defects in the upper and lower lock
links on the NLG. These inspections are designed to detect particular defects in areas of the highest probability
of forging flaws. 

2. Phase II inspections entail expanded off-aircraft eddy current inspections to detect defects of the upper and
lower lock links on the NLG. These inspections are more extensive than Phase I inspections and are designed to detect
defects in an expanded area where flaws could exist. 

3. Phase III inspections include an off-aircraft fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect defects in the upper
and lower lock links on the NLG. These inspections include etching of the link material prior to accomplishing a fluorescent
penetrant inspection. Accomplishment of Phase III inspections will ensure that all forging defects are detected.


For NLG's on which a defective lock link is found, the alert service bulletins describe procedures for rework of the
defective lock link, or replacement of the defective lock link with a serviceable lock link. Accomplishment of the
fluorescent penetrant inspection and rework of any defective lock link found during that inspection, or replacement
of any defective lock link found during that inspection, eliminates the need for 
the eddy current inspections specified in the alert service bulletins. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of this same type
design, this AD supersedes AD 94-09-01 and AD 94-09-17 to require inspections to determine
the serial numbers and to detect defects in the upper and lower lock links on the NLG, and rework of any defective lock
link, or replacement of any defective lock link with a serviceable lock link. This AD also provides an optional terminating
action for the required inspections. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service
bulletins described previously. 

This AD also requires that operators report inspection findings to the FAA in the event any defect is found during any
inspection. 

The FAA is considering further rulemaking to require accomplishment of the 
optional terminating action specified in this AD. However, the proposed compliance time is sufficiently long so
that notice and time for public comment would not be impracticable. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons

in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-130-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt and Whitney JT9D-3 or JT9D-7
Series Engines, Excluding JT9D-70 Series Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords, stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose
fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary; and replacement of any loose fastener. This amendment
is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks and loose fasteners found in the 
forward lower spar web of the inboard strut on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3
and JT9D-7 series engines. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the strut from
the wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register 

on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12560). That action proposed to require inspections of the inboard and outboard strut chords,
stiffeners, and web to detect cracks and loose fasteners; repair of the chords, stiffeners, or web, if necessary;
and replacement of any loose fastener. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed rule be withdrawn since only six cracks have been reported in the
20 years these airplanes have been in service. In addition, these cracks were found only on the inboard struts during
normal maintenance. Boeing asserts that the probability of another strut with a pre-existing firewall crack experiencing
loads that approach the ultimate design condition is extremely remote. Boeing adds, however, that the airplane maintenance
manual is being revised to include an inspection of the lower spar web in the case of an unusual overload event. Boeing
also 
indicates that the results of one operator's inspections revealed only one loose fastener on one airplane out of 24
inspected. Boeing states that the firewall webs will be reinforced during the strut modification program referenced
in the proposal. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to withdraw this AD. The FAA has determined that inspections mandated
by the issuance of this AD are necessary to correct the unsafe condition presented by separation of the strut from the
wing of the airplane due to fatigue cracking in the web. These inspections are necessary until the 0.025-inch inboard
webs and the 0.032-inch outboard webs are replaced as part of the strut modification program discussed in the proposal.
Sonic fatigue analysis performed by Boeing in support of the decision to replace the webs has revealed that the existing
inboard and outboard webs on Model 747 series airplanes addressed in this AD are 
inadequate. Recent findings from an investigation of an incident involving a Model 747 series airplane indicate
that fatigue cracking found on the web of the airplane resulted from flexing or vibration of the web material. This
fatigue cracking resulted in the in-flight loss of an engine during airplane operation in severe turbulence. Since
the FAA considers it probable for other airplanes to have cracked webs, and since no requirements exist to 
restrict airplane operation in severe turbulence, the FAA finds that this AD action is necessary in order to prevent
in-flight engine loss. 

Several commenters request that inspections of the outboard webs be removed from the proposed rule so that the AD is
consistent with the referenced service bulletin. The commenters indicate that no cracking or loose fasteners have
been found on the outboard webs. The commenters also state that the design thickness of the webs (0.032 inch for the
outboard web; 0.025 inch for the inboard web) represents a 28 percent difference, which should be considered significant.


The FAA does not concur. The thickness of the inboard web of the incident 
airplane mentioned previously measured 0.027 inch. The FAA finds that there is little difference between the inboard
and outboard webs with standard manufacturing tolerances. Each web is similar in configuration, loading, and sonic
environments. In light of these considerations, the FAA concludes that the outboard strut web is subject to the same
unsafe condition as the inboard strut web and must be included in this AD. 

Several commenters request that the compliance times for inspections of the outboard strut be extended. One commenter
requests that the compliance times be revised to align with those recommended in the referenced service bulletin,
less the amount of time provided for public comment on the proposal. Another commenter requests that the compliance
times be extended to be consistent with a load analysis based upon the actual web thickness of the outboard strut. This
commenter assumes that the proposed repetitive inspection interval is based on a load analysis of the inboard strut
structure. Another 
commenter requests that the compliance times for the initial inspection of the inboard strut be extended to 15 months.
The commenter does not provide any justification for this request, however. 

The FAA concurs that the compliance times can be extended somewhat. The 
compliance times specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this AD have been revised to reflect the times recommended
in the manufacturer's service bulletin. The FAA finds that the proposed compliance time of 6 months specified for
airplanes that have accumulated 6,000 or more total landings, but less than 15,000 total landings [those airplanes
applicable to paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule] may be extended to 9 months. Although the service bulletin specifies
a recommended compliance time of 12 months for those 
airplanes, the FAA finds that, based on the service history of affected Model 747 series airplanes that fall within
this group, 9 months represents the maximum interval of time allowable for these airplanes to continue to operate
without compromising safety. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification
program for the engine strut that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification
program is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. 

There are approximately 380 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 140 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 22 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $169,400, or $1,210 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at
the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Hartzell Propeller Inc. HC-( )3Y( )-( ) Series Three-Bladed
Propellers 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Hartzell Propeller Inc. HC-( )3Y( )-( )
series three-bladed propellers, that currently requires initial and repetitive visual and eddy current inspections
for cracks in the area of the grease fitting holes on the side of the propeller hub arm. This amendment reduces the repetitive
inspection interval from 25 hours time in service (TIS) to 10 hours TIS. In addition, this amendment adds an optional
interim alternative method of compliance involving a chamfering modification to extend the initial and repetitive
inspection compliance interval. This amendment also adds a terminating action to require propeller hub replacement
to a new hub configuration where grease fittings are located in a reinforced area near the hub parting line. This amendment
is prompted by a report from the Aviation Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) of the United Kingdom and a recent incident
that indicates a hub failure could have occurred in less time than the 25 hour TIS inspection interval. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible propeller hub failure and subsequent propeller blade separation
and loss of the aircraft.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 20, 1989, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued priority letter airworthiness directive
(AD) 89-22-05, to require visual inspection of the propeller hub surface in the area of the grease fittings
at intervals of 50 hours time in service (TIS). That action was prompted by reports of propeller hub failures caused
by cracks initiating in the grease fitting holes on the side of the hub arm. These cracks typically originate in the
threads of the hub grease fitting, then propagate around the blade arm of the hub, resulting in failure of the hub. That
condition, if not corrected, could result in possible propeller hub failure and subsequent propeller blade separation
and loss of the aircraft. 


Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA received a report from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the United Kingdom
of a propeller hub failure on a propeller that had been visually inspected in accordance with AD 89-22-05.
The CAA's investigation revealed that the propeller hub crack had corrosion on the fracture surface that was present
for a considerable time but the crack was undetectable by visual inspection. The FAA, in conjunction with the CAA and
the manufacturer, determined that the visual inspection procedure alone is inadequate to reliably find cracks in
the propeller hub. On August 18, 1993, the FAA issued priority letter AD 93-16-14, which requires initial
and repetitive visual inspections and eddy current inspections (ECI) for cracks in the area of the grease fitting
holes on the side of the propeller hub. The FAA issued the final rule on this action on November 22, 1993, which was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67307). 
Recently, an inspector found an additional significant hub crack evidenced by grease leaking from the propeller
hub. The hub was eddy current inspected and verified that a crack of significant length was present. The hub had been
previously inspected using the eddy current inspection process with no crack indications present. A significant
crack indication occurred in less time than the current 25 hour TIS inspection interval. Based on this latest service
difficulty report, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reduce the current 25 hour TIS inspection interval
to 10 hours TIS for hubs installed on certain aircraft and to mandate replacement of existing designed hubs to the new
hub configuration as soon as practical on these aircraft. A total of 24 hub cracks have been found to date. At the present
time, over 2,500 propeller hubs have been distributed with the new post-1983 configuration propeller hub.

The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Hartzell Propeller Inc. Service Bulletin (SB) No. 165E,
dated January 21, 1994, that describes procedures for visual inspections, and ECI or fluorescent penetrant inspection
(FPI), for cracks in the area of the grease fitting holes on the side of the propeller hub. In addition, this SB describes
an interim alternative method of compliance that involves chamfering the inside and outside surfaces of the propeller
hub arm by the grease fitting holes. This modification allows the propeller to operate for 400 hours TIS, or 36 months
after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, before requiring, for propellers installed on certain
aircraft, hub replacement with a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub. This modification was created to provide
relief to certain aircraft that would have difficulty in complying with the stringent repetitive inspection intervals
and could not obtain propeller hub replacement in the near term. This modification was approved by the FAA as an alternative
method of compliance to AD 93-16-14, and has been added to this proposed AD as a interim compliance option.
Operators that have accomplished this modification in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E will be
given 400 hours TIS, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, prior to mandating
hub replacement for propellers installed on certain aircraft. For propellers installed on other aircraft, this
modification extends the repetitive inspection interval to 400 hours TIS. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other propellers of this same type
design, this AD supersedes AD 93-16-14 to reduce the repetitive inspection interval from 25 hours TIS
to 10 hours TIS for propellers installed on certain aircraft. The proposed AD would also require for these propellers
a mandatory terminating action by June 1995, or for those propellers that have been modified by chamfering, at 400
hours TIS, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, by requiring replacement
of the existing pre-1983 configuration hubs with a new post-1983 hub configuration. For affected propellers installed
on other aircraft, the chamfering modification extends the repetitive inspection interval to 400 hours TIS, and
the replacement of hubs as a terminating action is optional. In addition, the FAA has restricted the special flight
permit paragraph to only allow ferry flights to a point where the inspections can be performed, but to disallow ferry
flights when a crack is known or suspected. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously.
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-ANE-19.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Propellers with model designations and serial number ranges listed above and installed on non-agricultural aircraft,
which do 

not 

utilize Textron Lycoming TIO-540, LTIO-540, or turbocharged IO-540 series engines are exempt
from this AD. 
Propellers with new post-1983 hub configurations, i.e., which have the relocated grease fitting holes near the hub
parting line as shown in Figure 1, page 9, of Hartzell Propeller, Inc., Service Bulletin (SB) No. 165E, dated January
21, 1994, even though the propeller model and serial number are listed above, are exempt from this AD. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent possible propeller hub failure due to cracks that originate in the grease fitting holes on the side of the
hub, which could result in propeller blade separation and loss of the aircraft, accomplish the following: 
(a) For propellers installed on Textron Lycoming TIO-540 or LTIO-540 series reciprocating engines or
turbocharged IO-540 series reciprocating engines which are installed on Piper PA-31-325 Navajo
C/R, PA-31-350 Navajo ``Chieftain,'' T-1020 (same as PA-31-350), PA-60-700P,
Aerostar 700P aircraft, or propellers installed on any agricultural aircraft with any engine, accomplish the following:

(1) Within 10 hours time in service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, but not to exceed 25 hours TIS since the
last inspection, whichever occurs first, and thereafter at intervals of 10 hours TIS, perform a visual inspection
for presence of grease on the propeller and determine the source of this grease leakage prior to further flight. Following
the visual inspection, perform an eddy current inspection (ECI) or fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) for cracks
in accordance with Hartzell Propeller, Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994.





Note: 

Use of a black light to inspect the suspect area can aid in determining the source of grease leakage because authorized
grease contains fluorescent properties.



(i) If grease is leaking from the hub arm or wall, replace the propeller with a serviceable propeller prior to further
flight.

<PARENT> FR940831-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) If grease is determined to be leaking from other causes, take the appropriate corrective maintenance action
and record in appropriate maintenance records. 
(2) If a crack is found in a propeller hub during the inspections required in paragraph (a)(1) of this AD, replace the
propeller hub prior to further flight with a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub, or with a serviceable 1983
or earlier hub that has been inspected in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994.
Thereafter, perform a visual inspection, and ECI or FPI, for cracks in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB
No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, at intervals not to exceed 10 hours TIS since the last inspection, unless a new post-1983
later style propeller hub is installed, per paragraph (d) of this AD. 
(b) For propellers installed on all other aircraft models, except for the four non-agricultural models listed in
paragraph (a) of this AD, and that utilize Textron Lycoming TIO-540, LTIO-540, or turbocharged IO-540
series reciprocating engines accomplish the following: 
(1) Within 50 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, but not to exceed 50 hours TIS since the last inspection,
and thereafter at intervals of 50 hours TIS, perform a visual inspection for presence of grease on the propeller and
determine the source of this grease leakage prior to further flight. Following the visual inspection, perform an
ECI or FPI for cracks in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994.





Note: 

Use of a black light to inspect the suspect area can aid in determining the source of grease leakage because authorized
grease contains fluorescent properties.



(i) If grease is leaking from the hub arm or wall, replace the propeller with a serviceable propeller prior to further
flight. 
(ii) If grease is determined to be leaking from other causes, take the appropriate corrective maintenance action
and record in appropriate maintenance records. 
(2) If a crack is found in a propeller hub during the inspections required in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, replace the
hub prior to further flight with a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub, or with a serviceable 1983 or earlier
hub that has been inspected in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994. Thereafter,
perform a visual inspection, and ECI or FPI, 
at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS since the last inspection, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, unless
a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub is installed, per paragraph (d) of this AD. 
(c) An alternative method of compliance in Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, describes
a propeller hub modification to chamfer the inside and outside hub arm surfaces of the grease hole fitting. Performing
this interim modification allows an operator to extend the initial and repetitive inspection period as required
by paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this AD, as applicable, to 400 hours TIS. 
(1) For propellers installed on aircraft listed in paragraph (a) of this AD, once 400 hours TIS is reached, or 36 calendar
months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, the propeller hub must be replaced in accordance
with paragraph (d) of this AD. 
(2) For propellers installed on aircraft listed in paragraph (b) of this AD, once 400 hours TIS is reached, or 36 calendar
months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, an internal inspection is required at intervals
not to exceed 400 hours TIS since last inspection in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January
21, 1994, or replacement of the hubs must be determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD.

(e) Propeller hubs that are configured 1983 or earlier, with the grease fitting holes located on the side of the hub,
that have been removed from service cannot ever be approved for return to service. 
(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded
through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft
Certification Office.





Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive,
if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office.



(g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the inspections may be performed. 
(h) The inspections and modification shall be done in accordance with the following service document: 






This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes
Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A-1, 269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters, that requires a one-time visual
inspection to detect missing or damaged tail rotor pedal bulkhead gussets (gussets), loose or missing gusset rivets,
and initial installation of missing gussets or replacement of damaged gussets and rivets, if necessary. This amendment
is prompted by reports of missing or damaged tail rotor pedal bulkhead gussets and loose or missing gusset rivets.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the tail rotor pedal support structure that could
result in loss of tail rotor control and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A-1,
269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26264). That action proposed to require, within the next 100 hours' time-in-service after the
effective date of this AD, a one-time visual inspection to detect missing or cracked gussets, elongated rivet holes,
and loose or missing rivets. Also proposed, before further flight, was the initial installation of any missing gussets
or replacement of cracked gussets, gussets with elongated rivet holes, or gussets that contain loose or missing rivets.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with only editorial changes. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that 934 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $80 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $177,460. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
(Enstrom) Model F-28A, F-28C, F-28C2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters.
This action requires initial and repetitive inspections for delamination of the main rotor feathering elastomeric
Lamiflex bearing (Lamiflex bearing). This amendment is prompted by several reported failures of the Lamiflex bearing.
The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the Lamiflex bearing, abnormal vibrations in the
airframe and flight control system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Enstrom Model F-28A, F-28C,
F-28C2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters. Field reports indicate that several failures
of the main rotor feathering elastomeric Lamiflex bearings (Lamiflex bearings), part numbers (P/N) 28-14320-12
or 28-14320-15, have occurred in which the Lamiflex bearings have partially delaminated and extruded
rubber and brass. This delamination and extrusion caused a significant loss in flight control system feedback dampening
and resulted in a sudden increase in flight control system feedback, rotorcraft vibration, and degradation in flying
qualities. Continued operation of the helicopters resulted in complete delamination of the Lamiflex bearings.
The exact cause of the bearing delaminations is under investigation; however, both grease contamination and main
rotor overspeeds may have contributed to the reported premature failures. The reported Lamiflex bearing delaminations
occurred between 200 and 400 hours' total time-in-service (TIS). The Lamiflex bearing, located in the main rotor
retention system, allows the blades to change pitch, or angle of attack. Although delamination and degradation of
the Lamiflex bearing occurs slowly, once complete delamination has occurred, flying conditions could rapidly deteriorate.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the Lamiflex bearing, abnormal vibrations in the airframe
and flight control systems, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


The FAA has reviewed The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0081, Revision A, dated
November 16, 1992, which describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the Lamiflex bearing for delamination
within the next 5 hours' TIS or whenever: (1) There is a significant deterioration in ride quality during flight; (2)
a smooth rotor system suddenly loses track and/or experiences difficulty in maintaining a smooth track; (3) a trimmable
aircraft becomes untrimmable, or develops high cyclic stick forces; or (4) there is any sudden abnormal feedback
from the cyclic or collective controls, followed by a moderate to severe one-per-rev vibration. The SDB also describes
procedures for performing repetitive visual inspections of the Lamiflex bearing for delamination at each 100 hours'
TIS or at the annual inspection, whichever occurs first. The FAA has also reviewed Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0097, dated July 1, 1980, that provides information on replacement of the Lamiflex
bearing no later than 5 years from the date of manufacture. Since 1975, the date of manufacture has been stamped or etched
on the end plate of each Lamiflex bearing to assist in complying with the SIL. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Enstrom Model F-28A,
F-28C, F-28C2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters of the same type design, this
AD is being issued to prevent failure of the Lamiflex bearing, abnormal vibrations in the airframe and flight control
system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections
of the Lamiflex bearing for delamination within the next 5 hours' TIS; whenever main rotor tracking and balancing
procedures are required more than once within a 5 hours' TIS period; or, whenever abnormal airframe or flight control
system vibrations exist; and, replacement with an airworthy part if delamination is found. The AD also requires replacement
of the Lamiflex bearing not later than 5 years after the date of manufacture of the Lamiflex bearing. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the SDB described previously and the applicable maintenance manual.
Due to the critical need for the Lamiflex bearing to ensure the continued safe flight of the affected helicopters,
and the necessary short compliance time that requires an inspection for delamination of the Lamiflex bearing be conducted
upon the occurrence of specified conditions or within the next 5 hours' TIS, this rule must be issued immediately to
correct an unsafe condition in the affected helicopters. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-SW-09-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.


The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the Federal Register expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but
refer to their graphic depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages
of incorporation by reference are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in
FAA form documents is unnecessary. The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with
the types and effective dates of the SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure
identification and the amendment number.


The Rule


This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are necessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. The amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Form
8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. The
SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument
Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions existing
or anticipated at the affected airports.

 Final rules. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adding new rules to our regulations on filing an application for Social Security or Supplemental Security Income
(SSI) benefits to implement the provisions of section 10302 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA
1989), Pub. L. 101-239. Section 10302 added sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Social Security Act (the
Act) to provide, in general, for the establishment of a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits under
title II or title XVI of the Act, respectively, in any case in which it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary
that an individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits because of misinformation provided
to the individual by an officer or employee of the Social Security Administration (SSA) about his or her eligibility
for the benefits. In general, sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) provide that, in such a case, an individual will be
``deemed'' to have applied for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits, as appropriate, on the later of: The date the
misinformation was provided to such individual; or the date such individual met all requirements for entitlement
to or eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement of filing an application. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


These regulations implement the provisions of section 10302 of OBRA 1989, Pub. L. 101-239, which added sections
202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act. Sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act provide that in any case in which
it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security
or SSI benefits because of misinformation provided to such individual by an officer or employee of SSA relating to
the individual's eligibility for the respective benefits, such individual will be ``deemed'' to have applied for
monthly Social Security or SSI benefits, as the case may be, on the later of: (1) The date the misinformation was provided
to such individual; or (2) the date on which such individual met all requirements for entitlement to Social Security
benefits, or all requirements of eligibility for SSI benefits, as appropriate, other than the requirement of filing
an application. The amendment relating to applications for monthly Social Security benefits, under section 202(j)(5)
of the Act, applies to misinformation provided after December 31, 1982, and is effective for benefits payable for
months beginning after that date. The amendment relating to applications for SSI benefits, under section 1631(e)(5)
of the Act, applies to misinformation provided on or after December 19, 1989, the date of the enactment of OBRA 1989,
and is effective for benefits payable for months after December 1989. 
We are amending our regulations on filing an application for Social Security or SSI benefits to include rules to implement
section 10302 of OBRA 1989. These final regulations describe the rules for establishing a ``deemed'' filing date
of an application for benefits under section 202(j)(5) or 1631(e)(5) of the Act in a case in which an individual failed
to apply for benefits because of certain misinformation provided to the individual by an officer or employee of SSA.
Among other things, the regulations explain what is meant by ``misinformation'' for purposes of these rules, describe
the kinds of evidence we will consider in determining whether misinformation was provided, and explain that a determination
on a claim for benefits under these sections of the Act, i.e., a determination as to whether or not to establish a ``deemed''
filing date of an application on the basis that misinformation was provided which caused an individual not to apply
for benefits, is an initial determination for purposes of administrative and judicial review. 
In general, our current regulations at   404.603 and 416.305(a) provide that to become entitled to Social
Security benefits or become eligible to receive SSI benefits, an individual, in addition to meeting all other requirements,
must file an application for Social Security benefits or for SSI benefits, as appropriate. An application must be
on a prescribed application form and meet certain other requirements specified in  404.610 or  416.310.

Current  404.614 provides, with certain exceptions, that an application for Social Security benefits is filed
on the day it is received by an SSA employee at one of our offices or by an SSA employee who is authorized to receive it at
another place. If a written statement indicating intent to claim Social Security benefits is filed, we will use the
filing date of the written statement as the filing date of the application under the conditions described in  404.630.
Also, if an individual telephones us and advises us that he or she intends to file a claim for Social Security benefits
but cannot file an application before the end of the month,  404.630(b) provides that we will prepare and sign
a written statement if it is necessary to prevent the loss of benefits. 
In the SSI program, current  416.325 provides, with certain exceptions, that an application for SSI benefits
is considered to be filed on the day it is received by an SSA employee at any Social Security office, by someone at another
Federal or State office designated to receive applications for us, or by a person whom we have authorized to receive
applications for us. Also, under the conditions described in   416.340, 416.345 and 416.350, if we receive
a written statement indicating an intent to claim SSI benefits or an oral inquiry about SSI benefits, we will use the
filing date of the written statement or the date of the oral inquiry as the filing date of the application, if the use
of that date will result in eligibility for additional benefits.

Under these final rules, we continue to require the filing of a formal written application before we will make a determination
on a claim for benefits under section 202(j)(5) or 1631(e)(5) of the Act based on an allegation that misinformation
was provided which caused an individual not to apply for benefits. If we determine that such misinformation was provided,
however, we will deem the filing date of the application to be the date the misinformation was provided or, if later,
the date the claimant, i.e., the individual who is claiming benefits for himself or herself or the person on whose behalf
benefits are being claimed, met all the requirements for entitlement to Social Security benefits or eligibility
for SSI benefits, as appropriate, other than the requirement of filing an application. 
Under our current regulations, an application for SSI benefits is also an application for any applicable federally
administered State supplementary payments under section 1616 of the Act. The current regulations which govern the
filing of applications for SSI benefits, therefore, also apply to applications for these State supplementary payments.
This is reflected in current  416.302 which provides that for purposes of the regulations on filing applications
for SSI benefits,  416.301 

et seq.

, ``

[b]enefits

 means any payments made under the SSI program,'' and ``SSI benefits also include any federally administered State
supplementary payments.'' As explained below, these definitions would continue to apply under the regulations
which implement section 1631(e)(5) of the Act. 
Section 1631(e)(5) of the Act applies specifically to cases in which an individual failed to apply for SSI benefits
because of the receipt of misinformation relating to eligibility for SSI benefits. However, because the application
form and our current rules on filing applications are the same for both SSI claims and claims for federally administered
State supplementary payments, we also will apply the provisions under section 1631(e)(5) to cases involving misinformation
about eligibility for federally administered State supplementary payments. This rule is based on the authority
under section 1631(e)(1)(A) of the Act which directs the Secretary to ``prescribe such requirements with respect
to the filing of applications * * * as may be necessary for the effective and efficient administration
of this title.'' Therefore, while not required under section 1631(e)(5) of the Act, the final regulations will permit
the establishment of a ``deemed'' filing date of an application in situations in which an individual failed to file
an application because we provided the individual misinformation about his or her eligibility for these State supplementary
payments.

Deemed Filing Date of an Application in a Case of Misinformation 


We are adding new   404.633 and 416.351 to our regulations to explain the rules we will follow in implementing
sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act, respectively. Sections 404.633(b) and 416.351(b) of the final regulations
explain that we may establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits under these sections of the Act
if we determine to our satisfaction that_



(1) An individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits for himself or herself because we provided
such individual misinformation about his or her eligibility for the respective benefits, including misinformation
about the amount or payment of such benefits; or 
(2) An individual who had authority to sign an application for another person under  404.612 or  416.315,
as appropriate, failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits for that person because we provided the
individual misinformation about such person's eligibility for the respective benefits, including misinformation
about the amount or payment of such benefits. 



In the first situation, we would deem an application to have been filed on the date the misinformation was provided
to the individual or, if later, the date on which such individual met all of the requirements for entitlement to monthly
Social Security benefits or eligibility for SSI benefits, as the case may be, other than the requirement of filing
an application. In the second situation, we would deem an application to have been filed on the date the misinformation
was provided to the individual or, if later, the date on which the person referred to in item (2) above, i.e., the person
on whose behalf the individual was inquiring about getting benefits, met all the requirements for entitlement to
monthly Social Security benefits or eligibility for SSI benefits, as the case may be, other than the requirement of
filing an application. 
The regulations explain that we will apply certain requirements and conditions which are specified in the regulations
in making the determination described above, i.e., a determination as to whether misinformation was provided. The
regulations explain that before we may make such a determination and establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application
for benefits, an application for such benefits must be filed with us either by the claimant, i.e., the individual in
item (1) above or the person referred to in item (2) above, or by someone who is authorized to sign an application on behalf
of the claimant under  404.612 or  416.315. The regulations also provide that if the claimant dies after
the alleged misinformation was provided but before an application is filed, an application for monthly Social Security
benefits must be filed by a person who would be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased. With respect to SSI
benefits, if the claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided but before an application is filed,
a person who would be qualified under  416.542(b) to receive any benefits due the deceased, or someone on behalf
of such a person, must file an application for the benefits. This latter provision is consistent with the provisions
of our final regulations on ``Payment of Benefits Due Deceased Recipients,'' which were published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993, at 58 FR 52909. 
Our regulations on ``Payment of Benefits Due Deceased Recipients'' amended certain sections of the SSI regulations,
including, as pertinent here,   416.340(d)(2), 416.345(e)(2), and 416.542(b), to implement section
8 of Pub. L. 99-643. Section 8 of Pub. L. 99-643 amended section 1631(b)(1) of the Act to expand the circumstances
under which SSI benefits due a deceased individual may be paid to survivors. Among other things, those regulations
amended   416.340(d)(2) and 416.345(e)(2) to permit, in general, a deceased claimant's surviving spouse
or parent(s) who could receive the claimant's benefits under  416.542(b), or someone on behalf of such surviving
spouse or parent(s), to file an application for SSI benefits for the claimant where the claimant dies after we receive
a written statement indicating an intent to claim SSI benefits or an oral inquiry about SSI eligibility. The rule which
we now are adding regarding who may file an application for SSI benefits on behalf of a claimant where the claimant dies
after the alleged misinformation was provided, discussed above, is consistent with these earlier changes to the
SSI regulations. 
We are amending   404.612, 404.615 and 416.310 to reflect the provisions of   404.633(b)
and 416.351(b) concerning who may file an application if a claimant dies after the alleged misinformation was provided.

Sections 404.633(c) and 416.351(c) explain that the provisions for establishing a ``deemed'' filing date of an application
apply only to cases in which the misinformation was provided to the individual by an employee of SSA, including an officer
of the Agency, while such person was acting in his or her official capacity as an employee or officer of the Agency. The
regulations also explain that ``misinformation'' is information which we would consider incorrect, misleading,
or incomplete in view of the facts which the individual gave to the employee, or of which the employee otherwise was
aware or should have been aware, regarding the claimant's particular circumstances. Under these regulations, we
will consider the information provided to be incomplete if the employee failed to provide the individual with appropriate,
additional information which he or she is required to provide in carrying out his or her official duties. The misinformation
may have been provided orally or in writing. However, the misinformation must have been provided to the individual
in response to his or her request to us for information about applying for benefits, either for himself or herself or
for another person for whom he or she could sign an application.

We also are amending   404.614 and 416.325, which 
explain when an application for benefits is considered filed, to reflect the provisions of   404.633
and 416.351. 


Evidence That Misinformation Was Provided 


In   404.633(d) and 416.351(d), we describe the kinds of evidence we will consider in determining whether
misinformation was provided. We explain that preferred evidence is written evidence that relates directly to an
individual's inquiry about his or her eligibility for benefits, or about the eligibility of another person on whose
behalf the individual was considering applying for benefits, and which shows that we gave the individual misinformation
which caused him or her not to file an application for such benefits. Preferred evidence includes, but is not limited
to, the following_



 A notice, letter, or other document which was issued by SSA and addressed to the individual; and 
 An SSA record of a telephone call, letter or in-person contact. 



In the absence of preferred evidence, we will consider other evidence which includes, but is not limited to, the following_



 The individual's statements about the alleged misinformation, including statements about the date and time
of the alleged contact(s); how the contact was made, e.g., by telephone or in person; the reason(s) the contact was
made; who gave the misinformation; and the questions asked by the individual and the facts the individual gave us,
and the questions asked by the SSA employee and the information the employee gave the individual at the time of the contact;

 Statements from others who were present when the alleged misinformation was given, e.g., a neighbor who accompanied
the individual to the SSA office; 
 If the individual can identify the employee or the employee can recall the individual's inquiry about benefits_

(1) Statements from the employee concerning the alleged contact, including statements about the questions the individual
asked, the facts the individual gave, the questions the employee asked, and the information provided to the individual
at the time of the alleged contact; and 
(2) An assessment of the likelihood that the SSA employee gave the alleged misinformation; 
 An evaluation of the credibility and the validity of the individual's allegations in conjunction with other
relevant information; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940831-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940831-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Any other information regarding the individual's alleged contact.




We will evaluate the individual's allegations and seek corroboration; we will resolve reasonable doubt in the individual's
favor if the allegation of misinformation seems credible, is supported by other evidence, and there is no contradictory
evidence. 


Information Which Does Not Constitute Satisfactory Proof That Misinformation Was Given 



Sections 404.633(e) and 416.351(e) explain that certain kinds of information will not constitute satisfactory
proof that we gave the individual misinformation which caused him or her not to file an application. Examples of such
information include_



 General informational pamphlets that we issue to provide basic program information; 

 The Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement that is based on an individual's reported and projected
earnings and is an estimate of Social Security benefits which can be requested at any time; the estimate is only a projection
based on our records and the individual's estimated future earnings and is not necessarily associated with an intent
to file or an inquiry about eligibility; 

 The SSI Benefit Estimate Letter that is based on an individual's reported and projected income and is an estimate
which can be requested at any time; the estimate is only a projection based on our records and the individual's estimated
income and is not necessarily associated with an intent to file or an inquiry about eligibility; 

 General information we review or prepare but which is disseminated by the media, e.g., radio, television,
magazines, and newspapers; and 

 Information concerning Social Security and SSI benefits provided by other governmental agencies, e.g.,
the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, State unemployment agencies, and State and local
governments. 



Claim for Benefits Based on Alleged Misinformation 



Under   404.633(f) and 416.351(f), an individual at any time may ask us to consider establishing a deemed
filing date on the basis that misinformation was provided. However, the regulations explain that we will not make
a determination on such a claim for benefits unless the following conditions are met. 

First, a claim for benefits based on an allegation that we provided misinformation must be made in writing. The written
statement must explain what information was provided; how, when and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information
caused the individual not to file an application for benefits. 

Second, an application for the benefits must be filed by the claimant or by someone who could file on behalf of the claimant.
The application must be filed after the occurrence of the alleged misinformation. This application may be_




 An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision awarding such benefits to the
claimant, provided that the claimant continues to be entitled to Social Security benefits, or continues to be eligible
for SSI benefits (or again could be eligible for SSI benefits), based on that application; 
 An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision denying the benefits to the
claimant, but only if such determination or decision is reopened under 
 404.988 or  416.1488; or 

 A new application on which we have not made a final determination or decision.




Third, if the only issue in dispute is whether or not the alleged misinformation occurred, we will not make an initial
determination on a claim for benefits under  404.633 or  416.351 unless the establishment of a deemed
filing date of an application based on the alleged misinformation would result in the claimant becoming entitled
to, or eligible for, benefits or additional benefits. 

Fourth, we will not make an initial determination on a claim for benefits under  404.633 or  416.351 if
we have made a previous determination or decision on a claim for benefits based on the alleged misinformation which
involved the same party(ies), the same facts and the same issues, and this previous determination or decision has
become final. This rule does not apply, however, if the previous final determination or decision may be reopened under
 404.988 or  416.1488.

We are amending   404.903 and 416.1403 to explain that if we decline to make an initial determination on
a claim for benefits based on an allegation of misinformation because one or more of the conditions specified above
are not met, our action is not an initial determination for purposes of our administrative review process or judicial
review. We also are amending   404.902 and 416.1402 to make it clear that if we make a determination on a
claim for benefits based on an allegation of misinformation, the determination is an initial determination subject
to administrative and judicial review under  404.900 

et seq.

 or  416.1400 

et seq.

 




Public Comments 




We published proposed rules in the 

Federal Register

 on 
October 16, 1992, 57 FR 47415. We gave interested parties 60 days to submit comments. We also published an amendment
to the proposed rules on January 22, 1993, 58 FR 5687, and we gave interested parties another 60 days to submit comments
on the proposed rules, as amended. We received comments from four commenters: a public policy research center concerned
with child health care, a State public health agency employee, and two attorneys who represent claimants and beneficiaries.


One commenter supported the proposed rules without modification. Another commenter supported the proposed rules
but recommended that another example of a situation involving misinformation be included in the rules. The other
commenters believed that the proposed rules should be expanded to cover certain other situations in which an individual
failed to file an application for benefits. In addition, while commending the proposed rules, two of the commenters
recommended that SSA also take steps to ensure that Agency employees provide correct information to potential applicants
when they inquire about eligibility for benefits. A summary of the comments and our responses to the comments are provided
below. 

We considered carefully all of the substantive comments which we received on the proposed rules. However, for the
reasons explained below, we did not make any changes to the proposed rules other than certain editorial changes discussed
below. Therefore, except for some editorial changes, these final rules are the same as the proposed rules. 



Comment: 

One commenter recommended that the proposed rules be expanded to include an example of a situation in which an individual,
such as a parent, inquires about filing an application on behalf of a child for SSI benefits based on disability or blindness
and is provided misinformation by SSA about the child's eligibility for benefits which causes the individual not
to file an application for the benefits. This commenter also stated that often a parent of a child who may be disabled
or blind contacts SSA to inquire about SSI benefits for the child at the suggestion of a child advocate, case manager
or hospital social worker. The commenter believed that these case workers can serve as sources to corroborate dates
and facts of the contact in cases of alleged misinformation since parents in these situations usually recontact the
case worker to advise the worker that they were dissuaded from applying for benefits because of the information which
SSA provided to them about the child's eligibility. 




Response: 

The examples in  416.351(a) are intended simply to illustrate situations in which misinformation provided
by an SSA employee concerning a potential claimant's eligibility for SSI benefits causes an individual not to file
an application for the benefits. The examples are not intended to cover all situations involving alleged misinformation
or all categories of SSI benefits. Existing  416.315(b) provides that an application for SSI benefits for a
claimant who is under age 18 may be signed by an individual who is responsible for the care of the claimant, including
a relative, or by certain other individuals described in that section. In  416.351(b)(2)(i) of the final regulations,
we explain that if an individual had authority under  416.315 to sign an application for benefits for another
person, and we determined that the individual failed to apply for SSI benefits for that person because we gave the individual
misinformation about that person's eligibility for such benefits, we will deem an application for the benefits to
have been filed on the date specified in  416.351(b)(2)(i) (A) or (B), as appropriate. Section 416.351(b)(2)(i)
makes it clear that the rules for establishing a deemed filing date of an application for benefits based on misinformation
apply to cases in which a parent, or other individual authorized to sign an application for a child, failed to apply
for SSI benefits for a child because we gave the parent, or such other individual, misinformation about the child's
eligibility for SSI benefits. Section 404.633(b)(2)(i) of the final regulations provides similar rules with respect
to claims for Social Security benefits. We do not believe that it is necessary, therefore, to add an example to the regulations
to cover the specific situation in which an individual failed to apply for benefits on behalf of a child because we gave
the individual misinformation about the child's eligibility for the benefits. 


We agree with the commenter that in some circumstances a child advocate, case manager or hospital social worker may
be able to provide information regarding an individual's alleged contact with SSA. Under   404.633(f)
and 416.351(f), an individual who makes a claim for benefits based on alleged misinformation must furnish information
that will enable us to determine if we did provide misinformation to the individual about his or her eligibility for
benefits, or the eligibility of a person on whose behalf the individual was considering applying for benefits, which
caused the individual not to file an application for the benefits. Preferred evidence of such misinformation is written
evidence, such as a letter, which shows that we gave the individual misinformation which caused the individual not
to file an application. In the absence of preferred evidence, we will consider other evidence, including the individual's
statements about the alleged misinformation as well as ``[a]ny other information regarding [the individual's]
* * * alleged contact,'' as explained in   404.633(d)(2) and 416.351(d)(2). This would
include statements provided by a case worker concerning the individual's alleged contact.

Comment

: A commenter expressed the view that the proposed regulations do not address the situation in which an individual
who might be eligible for Social Security and SSI benefits files an application for Social Security benefits but does
not ask about or express interest in SSI benefits and does not file an application for those benefits at that time. The
commenter suggested that the proposed rules be amended to provide for the use of the filing date of the application
for Social Security benefits in such a case to establish the filing date of an application for SSI benefits. 


Response

: Existing   416.345 and 416.350, which are not affected by these final rules, already address the situation
discussed by the commenter. Section 416.350 provides that when an individual applies for Social Security benefits,
we will explain the requirements for eligibility for SSI benefits to the individual and give the individual a chance
to file an SSI application if it appears that he or she might be eligible for SSI benefits as explained in that section.
If the individual does not apply for SSI benefits at that time,  416.350 provides that we will treat his or her
filing of an application for Social Security benefits as an oral inquiry about SSI benefits for purposes of  416.345.
The filing date of the individual's Social Security application, therefore, may be used to establish the filing date
of an SSI application in accordance with  416.345. For these reasons, we did not adopt the change suggested by
the commenter. 


Comment

: One commenter questioned the requirement of proposed   404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) that ``[t]he
misinformation must have been provided to you in response to a specific request by you to us for information about your
eligibility for benefits or the eligibility for benefits of [another] * * * person * * *
for which you were considering filing an application.'' The commenter believed that this provision, as well as proposed
  404.633(a) and 416.351(a), would require an individual who requests a deemed filing date of an application
based on misinformation to show that he or she had a specific intent to claim benefits at the time the alleged misinformation
was provided. The commenter believed that such a requirement would be inconsistent with section 10302 of OBRA 1989.

It was the commenter's opinion that in enacting this statute, Congress intended to place an affirmative duty on SSA
to develop or encourage claims that could be filed, at least where a potential applicant presents material facts to
the Agency and an employee makes an incorrect or incomplete response. Therefore, the commenter believed that the
proposed rules should be revised to permit the establishment of a deemed filing date of an application where an individual
does not inquire about possible eligibility for benefits but simply presents information to the Agency that might
have alerted an SSA employee to a potential claim, and, because the employee does not consider and does not advise the
individual of the potential claim, the individual does not file an application for benefits. As an illustration,
the commenter described a situation in which information showing that a disability insurance beneficiary had children
who were born after the beneficiary began receiving disability benefits and who, upon the filing of the required applications,
could become entitled to child's insurance benefits based on the beneficiary's earnings record, was overlooked
during a continuing disability review interview with the beneficiary. 


Response

: Sections 404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) prescribe the circumstances in which the misinformation must have been
provided in order to have caused the individual not to file an application for benefits. These sections do not require
an individual to show that he or she had the express intention of filing an application for benefits at the time he or
she was provided the alleged misinformation. Rather, these sections provide only that the alleged misinformation
must have been provided in a situation in which the individual was considering applying for benefits and contacted
SSA to inquire about his or her eligibility for benefits or the eligibility of another person for whom the individual
had authority to sign an application. We believe this requirement, which is also reflected in   404.633(a)
and 416.351(a), is consistent with sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act, which were added by section 10302
of OBRA 1989.

Sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act do not provide for a deemed filing date of an application for benefits
in the situation described by the commenter. These sections provide for a deemed filing date when:



* * * it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an individual failed as of any date to
apply for [Social Security or SSI] benefits * * * by reason of misinformation provided to such individual
by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration relating to such individual's eligibility for [the
respective] benefits * * *.



To be accorded a deemed filing date under these sections of the Act, an individual must demonstrate to our satisfaction
that his or her failure to apply for benefits was due to misinformation which was communicated to that individual by
an officer or employee of SSA and which concerned that individual's eligibility for the benefits. There must be a satisfactory
showing that the failure to apply for benefits was the direct result of such misinformation. For this purpose, we require
in   404.633(c)(4) and 416.351(c)(4) that the misinformation must have been provided to an individual
in response to his or her request to us for information about his or her eligibility for benefits, or the eligibility
for benefits of another person, for which he or she was considering filing an application. 




Comment

: While expressing strong support for the proposed rules, one commenter urged that efforts be made by SSA to ensure
that misinformation is not disseminated from SSA field offices or teleservice centers. Another commenter who supported
the proposed rules recommended that SSA establish a monitoring process to identify sources of misinformation and
implement strategies to correct any problems that are found. 


Response

: We are committed to ensuring that we provide the highest quality service possible to the public in a courteous, timely
and accurate manner. We already have put into place procedures for monitoring the service provided to the public and
for addressing problems discovered in the delivery of service by our employees. As part of this effort, employees
are instructed to answer all calls by identifying their Agency, followed by their full name or a title and last name
for identification purposes. In addition, ongoing training is conducted, incoming telephone calls are randomly
monitored, in-office interviews are monitored, and quality reviews are conducted. We believe that these measures
to protect the public from being given misinformation will help to ensure that potential applicants are provided
timely and accurate information. 


Changes to the Proposed Rules 


In   404.633(b)(2)(ii) and 416.351(b)(2)(ii) of the final rules, we are revising the phrase ``Before
we may consider establishing'' which was used in the corresponding sections of the proposed rules. We are changing
the phrase to ``Before we may establish'' to conform to the wording of 
  404.633(b)(1)(ii) and 416.351(b)(1)(ii). This is simply an editorial change to make the provisions
of the final rules consistent. The final rules also reflect a few other nonsubstantive changes to the proposed rules.



Regulatory Procedures


Executive Order 12866 


We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria
for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


These regulations contain information collection requirements in   404.633(f) and 416.351(f). We
ordinarily would seek approval of these requirements from OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act. We are not doing
so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information using form SSA-795
(OMB No. 0960-0045). 
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 15 minutes per response. This
includes the time it will take to read the instructions, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information.
We expect approximately 1,000 claimants or applicants to complete form SSA-795 annually, and estimate the
total burden to be 250 hours. If you have any comments or suggestions on this estimate, write to the Social Security
Administration, Attn: Reports Clearance Officer, 1-A-21 Operations Building, Baltimore, MD 21235,
and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0960-0045), Washington, DC 20503.



Regulatory Flexibility Act 


We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

or (b)(2)(i) dies before an application for the benefits is filed, the application may be signed by a person who would
be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased person as explained in  404.633(b)(1)(ii) 
and (b)(2)(ii). 


* * * * * 


3. Section 404.614 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 404.614

(a) 

General rule. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and in   404.630 through 404.633 which relate
to the filing date of an application, an application for benefits, or a written statement, request, or notice is filed
on the day it is received by an SSA employee at one of our offices or by an SSA employee who is authorized to receive it at
a place other than one of our offices. 


* * * * * 



4. Section 404.615 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: 


 404.615

or (b)(2)(i) dies before an application for the benefits is filed, the application may be signed by a person who would
be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased person as explained in  404.633(b)(1)(ii) 
and (b)(2)(ii). 
5. A new undesignated heading and a new  404.633 are added to read as follows: 


Deemed Filing Date Based on Misinformation 


 404.633 

Deemed filing date in a case of misinformation. 


(a) 

General. 

You may have considered applying for monthly benefits for yourself or for another person, and you may have contacted
us in writing, by telephone or in person to inquire about filing an application for these benefits. It is possible that
in responding to your inquiry, we may have given you misinformation about your eligibility for such benefits, or the
eligibility of the person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file
an application at that time. If this happened, and later an application for such benefits is filed with us, we may establish
an earlier filing date under this section. 


Example 1: 

Mrs. Smith, a widow of an insured individual, contacts a Social Security office when she reaches age 60 to inquire about
applying for widow's insurance benefits. She is told by an SSA employee that she must be age 62 to be eligible for these
benefits. This information, which was incorrect, causes Mrs. Smith not to file an application for benefits. When
Mrs. Smith reaches age 62, she again contacts a Social Security office to ask about filing for widow's insurance benefits
and learns that she could have received the benefits at age 60. She files an application for these benefits, provides
the information required under paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation,
and requests a deemed filing date based on the misinformation which she received from an SSA employee when she was age
60.

Example 2: 

Ms. Hill, a 22-year-old, is forced to stop work because of illness. When she contacts a Social Security office to inquire
about applying for disability insurance benefits, she is told by an SSA employee that she must have 20 quarters of coverage
out of the last 40 calendar quarters to be insured for disability insurance benefits. The employee fails to consider
the special rules for insured status for persons who become disabled before age 31 and, consequently, tells Ms. Hill
that she is not insured because she only has 16 quarters of coverage. The misinformation causes Ms. Hill not to file
an application for disability insurance benefits. Because of her illness, she is unable to return to work. A year later,
Ms. Hill reads an article that indicates that there are special rules for insured status for young workers who become
disabled. She again contacts a Social Security office to inquire about benefits based on disability and learns that
she was misinformed earlier about her insured status. She files an application for disability insurance benefits,
provides the information required under paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation,
and requests a deemed filing date based on the misinformation provided to her earlier. 
(b) 

Deemed filing date of an application based on misinformation. 

Subject to the requirements and conditions in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, we may establish a deemed
filing date of an application for monthly benefits under the following provisions.
(1)(i) If we determine that you failed to apply for monthly benefits for yourself because we gave you misinformation
about your eligibility for such benefits, we will deem an application for such benefits to have been filed with us on
the later of_
(A) The date on which the misinformation was provided to you; or 
(B) The date on which you met all of the requirements for entitlement to such benefits, other than the requirement of
filing an application. 
(ii) Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application for benefits for you under paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section, you or a person described in  404.612 must file an application for such benefits. If you die before
an application for the benefits is filed with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an application
for such benefits only if an application for the benefits is filed with us by a person who would be qualified to receive
any benefits due you. 

(2)(i) If you had authority under  404.612 to sign an application for benefits for another person, and we determine
that you failed to apply for monthly benefits for that person because we gave you misinformation about that person's
eligibility for such benefits, we will deem an application for such benefits to have been filed with us on the later
of_
(A) The date on which the misinformation was provided to you; or 
(B) The date on which the person met all of the requirements for entitlement to such benefits, other than the requirement
of filing an application. 
(ii) Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application for benefits for the person under paragraph (b)(2)(i)
of this section, you, such person, or another person described in  404.612 must file an application for such
benefits. If the person referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section dies before an application for the benefits
is filed with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an application for such benefits only if an application
for the benefits is filed with us by a person who would be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased person.

(c) 

Requirements concerning the misinformation. 

We apply the following requirements for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. 

(1) The misinformation must have been provided to you by one of our employees while he or she was acting in his or her official
capacity as our employee. For purposes of this section, an employee includes an officer of SSA. 

(2) Misinformation is information which we consider to be incorrect, misleading, or incomplete in view of the facts
which you gave to the employee, or of which the employee was aware or should have been aware, regarding your particular
circumstances, or the particular circumstances of the person referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
In addition, for us to find that the information you received was incomplete, the employee must have failed to provide
you with the appropriate, additional information which he or she would be required to provide in carrying out his or
her official duties. 

(3) The misinformation may have been provided to you orally or in writing. 

(4) The misinformation must have been provided to you in response to a specific request by you to us for information
about your eligibility for benefits or the eligibility for benefits of the person referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i)
of this section for which you were considering filing an application. 

(d) 

Evidence that misinformation was provided. 

We will consider the following evidence in making a determination under paragraph (b) of this section. 

(1) 

Preferred evidence. 

Preferred evidence is written evidence which relates directly to your inquiry about your eligibility for benefits
or the eligibility of another person and which shows that we gave you misinformation which caused you not to file an
application. Preferred evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following_

(i) A notice, letter or other document which was issued by us and addressed to you; or 

(ii) Our record of your telephone call, letter or in-person contact. 

(2) 

Other evidence. 

In the absence of preferred evidence, we will consider other evidence, including your statements about the alleged
misinformation, to determine whether we gave you misinformation which caused you not to file an application. We will
not find that we gave you misinformation, however, based solely on your statements. Other evidence which you provide
or which we obtain must support your statements. Evidence which we will consider includes, but is not limited to, the
following_

(i) Your statements about the alleged misinformation, including statements about_ 

(A) The date and time of the alleged contact(s); 

(B) How the contact was made, e.g., by telephone or 
in person; 

(C) The reason(s) the contact was made; 

(D) Who gave the misinformation; and 

(E) The questions you asked and the facts you gave 
us, and the questions we asked and the information we gave you, at the time of the contact; 

(ii) Statements from others who were present when you were given the alleged misinformation, e.g., a neighbor who
accompanied you to our office; 

(iii) If you can identify the employee or the employee can recall your inquiry about benefits_

(A) Statements from the employee concerning the 
alleged contact, including statements about the questions you asked, the facts you gave, the questions the employee
asked, and the information provided to you at the time of the alleged contact; and 

(B) Our assessment of the likelihood that the employee 
provided the alleged misinformation; 

(iv) An evaluation of the credibility and the validity 
of your allegations in conjunction with other relevant information; and 

(v) Any other information regarding your alleged 
contact. 

(e) 

Information which does not constitute satisfactory 
proof that misinformation was given. 

Certain kinds of information will not be considered satisfactory proof that we gave you misinformation which caused
you not to file an application. Examples of such information include_

(1) General informational pamphlets that we issue to 
provide basic program information; 

(2) The Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate 
Statement that is based on an individual's reported and projected earnings and is an estimate which can be requested
at any time; 

(3) General information which we review or prepare but 
which is disseminated by the media, e.g., radio, television, magazines, and newspapers; and 

(4) Information provided by other governmental 
agencies, e.g., the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, State unemployment agencies, and
State and local governments. 

(f) 

Claim for benefits based on misinformation. 

You 
may make a claim for benefits based on misinformation at any time. Your claim must contain information that will enable
us to determine if we did provide misinformation to you about your eligibility for benefits, or the eligibility of
a person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file an application for
the benefits. Specifically, your claim must be in writing and it must explain what information was provided; how,
when and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information caused you not to file an application. If you give
us this information, we will make a determination on such a claim for benefits if all of the following conditions are
also met.

(1) An application for the benefits described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i) of this section is filed with us by someone described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or
(b)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate. The application must be filed after the alleged misinformation was provided.
This application may be_

(i) An application on which we have made a previous 
final determination or decision awarding the benefits, but only if the claimant continues to be entitled to benefits
based on that application; 

(ii) An application on which we have made a previous 
final determination or decision denying the benefits, but only if such determination or decision is reopened under
 404.988; or 

(iii) A new application on which we have not made a 
final determination or decision. 

(2) The establishment of a deemed filing date of an 
application for benefits based on misinformation could result in the claimant becoming entitled to benefits or to
additional benefits. 

(3) We have not made a previous final determination or 
decision to which you were a party on a claim for benefits based on alleged misinformation involving the same facts
and issues. This provision does not apply, however, if the final determination or decision may be reopened under  404.988.

(3) We will establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application in a case of misinformation under the conditions described
in  416.351. The filing date of the application will be a date determined under  416.351(b). 

4. A new undesignated heading and a new  416.351 are added to read as follows: 



Deemed Filing Date Based on Misinformation



 416.351 

Deemed filing date in a case of misinformation. 



(a) 

General.

 You may have considered applying for SSI benefits for yourself or for another person, and you may have contacted us
in writing, by telephone or in person to inquire about filing an application for these benefits. It is possible that
in responding to your inquiry, we may have given you misinformation about your eligibility for such benefits, or the
eligibility of the person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file
an application at that time. If this happened, and later an application for such benefits is filed with us, we may establish
an earlier filing date under this section. 



Example 1

: Ms. Jones calls a Social Security office to inquire about filing an application for SSI benefits. During her conversation
with an SSA employee, she tells the employee about her resources. The SSA employee tells Ms. Jones that because her
countable resources are above the allowable limit, she would be ineligible for SSI benefits. The employee fails to
consider certain resource exclusions under the SSI program which would have reduced Ms. Jones' countable resources
below the allowable limit, making her eligible for benefits. Because Ms. Jones thought that she would be ineligible,
she decides not to file an application for SSI benefits. Ms. Jones later reads about resource exclusions under the
SSI program. She recontacts the Social Security office to file an SSI application, and alleges that she had been previously
misinformed about her eligibility for SSI benefits. She files an application for SSI benefits, provides the information
required under paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation, and requests a
deemed filing date based upon her receipt of misinformation. 



Example 2

: Mr. Adams resides in a State which provides State supplementary payments that are administered by SSA under the SSI
program. He telephones a Social Security office and tells an SSA employee that he does not have enough income to live
on and wants to file for SSI benefits. Mr. Adams states that his only income is his monthly Social Security benefit check.
The SSA employee checks Mr. Adams' Social Security record and advises him that he is ineligible for SSI benefits based
on the amount of his monthly Social Security benefit. The employee does not consider whether Mr. Adams would be eligible
for State supplementary payments. Because Mr. Adams was told that he would not be eligible for benefits under the SSI
program, he does not file an application. The employee does not make a record of Mr. Adams' oral inquiry or take any other
action. A year later, Mr. Adams speaks to a neighbor who receives the same Social Security benefit amount that Mr. Adams
does, but also receives payments under the SSI program. Thinking the law may have changed, Mr. Adams recontacts a Social
Security office and learns from an SSA employee that he would be eligible for State supplementary payments under the
SSI program and that he could have received these payments earlier had he filed an application. Mr. Adams explains
that he did not file an application earlier because he was told by an SSA employee that he was not eligible for SSI benefits.
Mr. Adams files an application for the benefits, provides the information required under paragraph (f) of this section
to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation, and requests a deemed filing date based on the misinformation
provided to him earlier. 

(b) 

Deemed filing date of an application based on misinformation.

 Subject to the requirements and conditions in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, we may establish a deemed
filing date of an application for SSI benefits under the following provisions.

(1)(i) If we determine that you failed to apply for SSI benefits for yourself because we gave you misinformation about
your eligibility for such benefits, we will deem an application for such benefits to have been filed with us on the later
of_

(A) The date on which the misinformation was provided 
to you; or 

(B) The date on which you met all of the requirements for eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement
of filing an application. 

(ii) Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application for benefits for you under paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section, you or a person described in  416.315 must file an application for such benefits. If you die before
an application for the benefits is filed with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an application
for such benefits only if a person who would be qualified under  416.542(b) to receive any benefits due you, or
someone on his or her behalf, files an application for the benefits. 

(2)(i) If you had authority under  416.315 to sign an application for benefits for another person, and we determine
that you failed to apply for SSI benefits for that person because we gave you misinformation about that person's eligibility
for such benefits, we will deem an application for such benefits to have been filed with us on the later of_

(A) The date on which the misinformation was provided to you; or 

(B) The date on which the person met all of the requirements for eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement
of filing an application. 

(ii) Before we may establish a deemed filing date of an application for benefits for the person under paragraph (b)(2)(i)
of this section, you, such person, or another person described in  416.315 must file an application for such
benefits. If the person referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section dies before an application for the benefits
is filed with us, we will consider establishing a deemed filing date of an application for such benefits only if a person
who would be qualified under  416.542(b) to receive any benefits due the deceased person, or someone on his behalf,
files an application for the benefits. 

(c) 

Requirements concerning the misinformation.

 We apply the following requirements for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. 

(1) The misinformation must have been provided to you by one of our employees while he or she was acting in his or her official
capacity as our employee. For purposes of this section, an employee includes an officer of SSA. 

(2) Misinformation is information which we consider to be incorrect, misleading, or incomplete in view of the facts
which you gave to the employee, or of which the employee was aware or should have been aware, regarding your particular
circumstances, or the particular circumstances of the person referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
In addition, for us to find that the information you received was incomplete, the employee must have failed to provide
you with the appropriate, additional information which he or she would be required to provide in carrying out his or
her official duties.

the facts you gave, the questions the employee asked, and the information provided to you at the time of the alleged
contact; and 

(B) Our assessment of the likelihood that the employee provided the alleged misinformation; 

(iv) An evaluation of the credibility and the validity of your allegations in conjunction with other relevant information;
and 

(v) Any other information regarding your alleged contact. 

(e) 

Information which does not constitute satisfactory proof that misinformation was given.

 Certain kinds of information will not be considered satisfactory proof that we gave you misinformation which caused
you not to file an application. Examples of such information include_

(1) General informational pamphlets that we issue to provide basic program information; 

(2) The SSI Benefit Estimate Letter that is based on an individual's reported and projected income and is an estimate
which can be requested at any time; 

(3) General information which we review or prepare but which is disseminated by the media, e.g., radio, television,
magazines, and newspapers; and 

(4) Information provided by other governmental agencies, e.g., the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department
of Defense, State unemployment agencies, and State and local governments. 

(f) 

Claim for benefits based on misinformation.

 You may make a claim for benefits based on misinformation at any time. Your claim must contain information that will
enable us to determine if we did provide misinformation to you about your eligibility for SSI benefits, or the eligibility
of a person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file an application
for the benefits. Specifically, your claim must be in writing and it must explain what information was provided; how,
when, and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information caused you not to file an application. If you give
us this information, we will make a determination on such a claim for benefits if all of the following conditions are
also met. 

(1) An application for the benefits described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i) of this section is filed with us
by someone described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate. The application must
be filed after the alleged misinformation was provided. This application may be_

(i) An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision awarding the benefits, but only
if the claimant continues to be eligible for benefits (or again could be eligible for benefits) based on that application;


(ii) An application on which we have made a previous final determination or decision denying the benefits, but only
if such determination or decision is reopened under  416.1488; or 

(iii) A new application on which we have not made a final determination or decision. 

(2) The establishment of a deemed filing date of an application for benefits based on misinformation could result
in the claimant becoming eligible for benefits or for additional benefits.

<USDEPT>PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION</USDEPT>








General Provisions Governing Vessels 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Panama Canal Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 1, 1994, the existing rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal will be replaced with the Panama
Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS). Currently, fees for booking transits at the Panama Canal are assessed
at a fixed rate per Panama Canal Gross Ton. Inasmuch as the PC/UMS will no longer utilize a Panama Canal Gross Tonnage
value, fees for the use of the transit booking system should be assessed on some other basis. This final rule authorizes
retention of the existing method of calculating booking fees for vessels subject to PC/UMS transitional relief measures
and the fixing of fees for all other vessels in reference to the PC/UMS Net Ton. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 17, 1994, the President approved a final rule with respect to a related matter_the complete revision of the
Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal as set forth in 35 CFR part 135. That final rule was published in
the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 43254) on August 22, 1994. The new measurement rules become effective October 1, 1994. 


Corresponding changes in the transit booking system regulations are necessary to reconcile 35 CFR  103.8(e)
with the aforementioned revisions to the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal. On August 16, 1994
a proposed rule with a request for comments was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 41997). In addition, the Commission provided individual notice to various shipping associations and agents.
No substantive comments were received which necessitate change in the final rule. 
Under existing  103.8(e), fees for booking transits at Panama Canal are assessed at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross
Ton. With the replacement of the existing measurement system on October 1, 1994, a Panama Canal Gross Ton value will
no longer exist. Instead, the new PC/UMS will utilize a PC/UMS Net Ton value. Accordingly, in order to continue using
tonnage as the basis for rate assessment for the transit booking system, fees must be assessed on the tonnage value
used in the PC/UMS. Therefore, transit booking fees will be fixed in relation to the PC/UMS Net Ton for vessels transiting
the Canal for the first time after September 30, 1994. The final rule also provides special relief measures for vessels
which have previously transited the Canal. These measures serve to minimize the financial impact of the change on
the individual customer. 
In the first category_vessels which have not transited the Canal before October 1, 1994, the final rule establishes
a new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton. This rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton is expected to result in a booking fee near
the rate assessed under the existing system. In other words, the amount paid by an individual vessel at $0.26 per PC/UMS
Net Ton will closely approximate the amount it would have paid at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. The new booking fee
rate will be applied to a limited number of vessels inasmuch as the number of first-time transits involves a relatively
small number of vessels each year. 
As noted above, the Commission's intention is to revise the rate in a manner which maintains fees at approximately
the same level as currently paid by individual vessels. Inasmuch as the revision is designed to reconcile paragraph
103.8(e) with the new standard tonnage measurement and not to otherwise alter the booking fees, the establishment
of the $0.26 rate will approximate present booking fees without increasing customer costs. 

For the other and larger category_vessels which have previously transited the Canal, the final rule retains the existing
booking fee computation method. This provision has its genesis in the revisions to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels
using the Panama Canal. The PC/UMS contains transitional relief measures which preserve existing tonnage for ships
transiting the Canal between March 23, 1976 (the date of the last significant rules change) and September 30, 1994,
inclusive. The final booking fee rule provides that the existing method for assessing booking fees for these vessels
be similarly retained. Vessels meeting the aforementioned PC/UMS requirements for transitional relief which use
the booking system after September 30, 1994 will not be affected inasmuch as they will continue to pay the same fee_$0.23
per Panama Canal Gross Ton. For these previously-transiting vessels, the booking fee would change only in the event
the vessel undergoes a significant structural change, defined in the PC/UMS as a change in the volume of the vessel
of 10% or more. Under the PC/UMS, a vessel undergoing a significant structural change loses its entitlement to the
relief measures and becomes subject to application of the PC/UMS measurement formulas. In such an instance, the new
rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton will be applied to the vessel. 
The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do
not apply to this final rule. Even if the order were applicable, the final rule, which concerns ``rates'' and ``practices
relating'' thereto, would not constitute a ``rule'' as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601(2)) and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under that Act. 
A review of the environmental effect of the final rule concludes that it will not have a significant effect on the quality
of the human environment. An environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969. 
Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.

Revisions to Standards for Walk-Sequenced Bulk Third-Class Mail 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual standards concerning walk-sequenced bulk third-class mail to require
an identifying marking on each piece.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 20, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment a proposed rule that would amend the Domestic Mail
Manual (DMM) standards for walk-sequence rate third-class mail. 59 FR 37011. Under current DMM section M304.3.2,
mailpieces claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be so identified either by a marking on the piece or by a facing slip
on the top of each package of such pieces. The proposed rule would make the on-piece rate marking a requirement; facing
slips would still be allowed, but they would no longer fulfill the requirement for identifying the mail as walk-sequence
rate. The proposed requirement would allow the Postal Service to quantify more precisely the costs of walk-sequenced
mail through its existing cost systems. 



The Postal Service received comments on the proposed rule from four parties. Only one party recommended retaining
the use of facing slips as a fulfillment of the requirement to identify walk-sequenced mailings. The commenter stated
that because only a small segment of qualifying mail uses facing slips, the slips should not cause problems for the
Postal Service. However, allowing facing slips rather than the marking could support a contention that some costs
were not being captured by postal cost systems and thus cast doubt on the validity of the resulting cost estimates.
The Postal Service feels that the value of obtaining reliable cost data for walk-sequenced mail outweighs the minor
inconvenience that the requirement would cause for this small segment of mail. 

Two commenters suggested that the Postal Service require other rate markings that would allow an even finer breakdown
of costs by its cost systems. The Postal Service feels that the additional markings would represent a more significant
change than what was contained in the proposed rule. Moreover, it is unclear that the benefits from more detailed costing
warrant such a major change in mail preparation requirements. Therefore, the Postal Service is limiting this rulemaking
to the new marking requirements for walk-sequenced mail. 

One commenter sought clarification regarding the application of the proposed rule to mailings using detached address
cards. Only the detached address card will be required to bear the marking, not the item accompanying the card. 

Another commenter stated that the requirement of two additional characters (WS) takes up more space in an already
crowded area. The Postal Service is sympathetic to this concern and the final rule has been written accordingly to
allow the marking WS CAR SORT to be used to denote walk-sequence-rated mail. 

After full consideration of the comments received, as discussed above, the Postal Service has decided to adopt as
the final rule the DMM revisions contained in the proposed rule, amended as noted above. 



List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 



Postal Service.

 


For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual,
which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111). 



PART 111_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows:

 




Authority:

2. Amend Domestic Mail Manual unit M304 by adding a new subsection 1.3 and revising subsection 3.2 to read as follows:




M304 Walk-Sequence 



1.0 Basic Standards 



* * * * * 



1.3 Marking 



In addition to the markings required by M303, each piece claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be marked ``WS'' immediately
preceding either the carrier route information on the carrier route information line (e.g., **WS CARRIER ROUTE 017)
or the carrier route presort marking shown in M303 (e.g., WS CAR-RT SORT, or the abbreviated form WS CAR SORT).
Pieces not claimed at a walk-sequence rate must not bear the ``WS'' marking. 



* * * * * 



3.0 Preparation 



* * * * * 



3.2 Labeling 



In addition to the labeling required in M303, a facing slip with a phrase identifying the mail (such as ``WALK-SEQUENCED
CARRIER ROUTE MAIL'') may be placed on the top of each package. A facing slip does not satisfy the marking required on
each piece by 1.3. 



* * * * * 



[A transmittal letter making these changes in the pages of the Domestic Mail Manual will be published and will be transmitted
to subscribers automatically. Notice of issuance will be published in the

1,1-Dichloro-2,2-Bis(p-Ethylphenyl) Ethane; Revocation of Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule revokes tolerances for residues of the pesticide 1,1-dichloro-2,2-

bis

(

p

-ethylphenyl) ethane (also known as Perthane, Ethylan, or diethyl diphenyl dichloroethane, and hereafter referred
to as Perthane), in or on raw agricultural commodities because all registrations of Perthane have been canceled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document announces the revocation of tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the pesticide Perthane in or on raw agricultural commodities listed
in 40 CFR 180.139.


EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28326), which proposed the revocation of tolerances for residues of Perthane in or on various
raw agricultural commodities. The Agency's decision to revoke these tolerances was based on the fact that all registered
uses of Perthane have been canceled.
The Agency believes that sufficient time has passed for legally treated agricultural commodities to have gone through
the channels of trade. Since it is unlikely that Perthane would persist in soil, there is no expectation of a residue
problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently, no action levels are being recommended to replace these
revoked tolerances.
No public comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response to the proposed rule.
Therefore, based on the information considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the June 1, 1994 proposal and
in this final rule, the Agency is hereby revoking the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.139 for residues of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-

bis

(

p

-ethylphenyl)ethane (Perthane).


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order, i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for
this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and
the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i).
If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested,
the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in
the June 1, 1994 proposed rule.

Pesticide Tolerances for Triasulfuron




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document extends the tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloro
ethoxy)
phe
nyl
sul
fonyl)
urea] in or on barley and wheat grain at 0.02 part per million (ppm); barley and wheat straw at 2.0 ppm; barley and wheat
forage at 5.0 ppm; meat, fat and meat byproducts (excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep; kidney
of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.2 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm. The Agency has not completed the regulatory
assessment of its science findings; therefore, EPA is proposing to extend these tolerances for 1 year.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35663), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Ciba-Geigy Corp. had submitted all
the required data to establish permanent tolerances for triasulfuron under 40 CFR 180.459. Because EPA has not completed
the regulatory assessment of its scientific findings, EPA proposed to amend 40 CFR 180.459 to extend the expiration
date for the tolerances until March 13, 1996.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the extended tolerances will protect the
public health. Therefore, the extended tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 29, (59 FR 33504), which announced that Miles, Inc., 8400 Hawthorn Rd., P.O. Box 4913, Kansas City, MO 64120-0013,
had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4F4320 to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.450 to increase the tolerances for
the fungicide 

beta

-(4-chloro
phenoxy)-


alpha

-
(1,1-di
meth
yl
ethyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol and its butanediol metabolite, 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2,2-dimethyl-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-1,3-butanediol,
calculated as parent, in or on wheat straw, barley straw, and oat straw from 0.1 part per million (ppm) to 0.2 ppm. These
tolerances were established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a.


There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.
The data submitted in support of the petition and other relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the tolerances include the following: 
1. A 2-year feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats using dietary concentrations of 0, 125, 500, and 2,000 ppm, equivalent
to 0, 6.25, 25.0, and 100 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) body weight (bwt)/day in males and females. Clinical chemistry
findings suggest that the target organ for toxicity may be the liver. The levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase
(SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) were consistently higher at 2,000 ppm in males and females
when compared to untreated controls, and some increase in these two parameters was also observed at 500 ppm. Although
there was an accompanying small increase in liver weight at 2,000 ppm in females, there were no accompanying increases
in histopathologic changes of the liver in either sex. There were only marginal effects seen on other clinical chemistry
parameters, and no effect of the test compound was seen on clinically observed signs of toxicity, food consumption,
hematology, or urinalysis parameters. The systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) is 125 ppm (6.25 mg/kg/day
for males and females) based on the increase in liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT). The systemic lowest-effect level (LEL)
was 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day for males and females). The chemical was not carcinogenic to rats under the testing conditions.
2. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice using dietary concentrations of 0, 125, 500, and 2,000
ppm (equivalent to doses of 0, 18, 72, and 285 mg/kg/day for males and females). The results of blood chemistry, organ
weights, and gross and histological examinations indicate that the liver is the target organ. There were time- and
dose-related increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), SGOT, and SGPT activities in both male and female animals
receiving 500 and 2,000 ppm of the test material.
In addition, increased incidence of enlarged livers, hyperplastic nodules, and increased liver weights in both
male and female animals receiving 2,000 ppm of test material was detected at necropsy. Female animals receiving 2,000-
ppm doses exhibited a significant increase in the incidence of liver adenomas only, a compound-related oncogenic
effect which is discussed further below. In males, there were no differences in the incidence of these lesions in treated
and control males, and the incidences of liver adenomas were similar to those observed in historical controls.
Based on blood chemistry findings, the systemic NOEL and the LEL are 125 and 500 ppm, respectively (equivalent to 18
and 72 mg/kg/day for males and females).
3. A 2-year male and female dog feeding study using doses of 0, 150, 600, and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 3.75, 15, and
60 mg/kg bwt/day for males and females). The NOEL is 150 ppm based on changes in enzyme levels (equivalent to 3.75 mg/kg
bwt/day for males and females). The LEL is 600 ppm. Although there were significant decreases in mean body weights
in males receiving 150 and 2,400 ppm and in females receiving 600 and 2,400 ppm, the biological significance of these
changes could not be assessed. There were noted increases in alkaline phosphatase 

N

-demethylase and cytochrome P-450 in males receiving 2,400 ppm and significant increases in 

N

-demethylase in females receiving 600 and 2,400 ppm and in cytochrome P-450 in females receiving 2,400 ppm when compared
to controls.
4. A 6-month dog feeding study using doses of 0, 10, 30, and 100 ppm (equivalent to 0, 0.25, 0.75, and 2.5 mg/kg bwt/day
for males and females). The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested (HDT).
5. A 3-month rat feeding study using doses of 0, 150, and 600 and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 7.5, 30 and 120 mg/kg bwt/day
for males and females) demonstrated a decrease in body weight, in hematocrit values, and in eosinophil count and medium
cell hemoglobin and demonstrated an increase in the high-dose group and a dose-related increase in liver weight.
The NOEL is 7.5 mg/kg and the LEL is 30 mg/kg.
6. A second 90-day rat feeding study using doses of 0, 120, 600, and 3,000 ppm demonstrated piloerection lasting 1 month
(month 1), decreases in body weight gain and feed efficiency lasting 1 week (week 1), alterations in serum lipids,
and increases in liver weight (absolute and relative) and in incidences of liver hypertrophy and fatty changes in
the high-dose group and an increase in the incidence of prostrate atrophy of slight severity in high-dose males. The
NOEL was 600 ppm, equivalent to 39.6 mg/kg/day for males and 46.4 mg/kg/day for females and the lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) was the HDT, 3,000 ppm, equivalent to 208.5 mg/kg/day for males and 221.1 mg/kg/day for females.
7. A 3-month dog feeding study using doses of 0, 150, 600, and 2,400 ppm (equivalent to 0, 3.75, 15, and 60 mg/kg bwt/day
for males and females). Weight gain in all male groups and in the highest dose female group was significantly less than
the control. Alkaline phosphatase in males and females showed a dose-related negative trend. There were no gross
pathological changes. Effects at 15 mg/kg included an increase in serum cholesterol level in males. Although the
NOEL appeared to be less than 3.75 mg/kg, based on reduced body weight and decreased alkaline phosphatase in males,
the Agency has concluded that effects below 15 mg/kg in the 2-year dog study were not biologically significant and
the longer-term study supersedes the 90-day dog study. Therefore, the NOEL remains at 3.75 mg/kg.
8. A rat developmental study using dose levels of 0, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day was determined to be core supplementary
because the NOEL for developmental toxicity (supernumerary ribs) was not definitively established. The NOEL and
LOEL for maternal toxicity for this study are 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively, based on decreases in maternal body
weight, body weight gain, and food consumption at 60 and 120 mg/kg/day. Increased embryolethality (embryotoxicity)
was only observed at the highest dose level tested (120 mg/kg/day). 
9. A repeat rat developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 15 mg/kg/day due to decreased body
weight gains, and with a developmental NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 60 mg/kg/day due to increased incidence of
extra ribs.
10. A supplementary rabbit developmental study with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 8 mg/kg and a maternal LEL of 40
mg/kg based on decreased body weight gains and food consumption. The developmental NOEL and LEL were 40 and 200 mg/kg,
respectively.
11. A repeat rabbit developmental study with a maternal NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 125 mg/kg/day due to decreases
in body weight gains and food consumption, and with a developmental NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day (HDT).
12. A reverse mutation assay (Ames), a dominant lethal test in mice, DNA damage/repair, unscheduled DNA synthesis,
in vitro and in vivo (rat) cytogenic assays, and a forward mutation in mice, all of which were negative for mutagenic
effects.
13. A rat multi-generation reproduction study using doses of 0, 20, 100, and 500 ppm (equivalent to 0, 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg
bwt/day for males and females) indicated that the NOEL and LOEL for both parental and pup toxicity are 100 and 500 ppm,
respectively, based on significant body weight and organ weight changes. The NOEL for reproductive toxicity is 500
ppm, the highest dose level tested. The Agency has concluded that the available data provide limited evidence of the
carcinogenicity of triadimenol in mice and has classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human
carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with Agency guidelines, published
in the 

Federal Register

 in 1986 (51 FR 33992; September 24, 1986). This evaluation was confirmed by the Agency's Scientific Advisory Panel
on December 15, 1987. Based on a review of the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of
the Office of Pesticide Programs, the Agency has determined that a quantitative risk assessment is not appropriate
for the following reasons:
1. The tumors observed were benign and observed in one sex (females) and were present only at the highest dose tested.
2. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to rats at dose levels ranging from 125 to 2,000 ppm.
3. The chemical was negative in the genotoxic assay battery.
Based on this evidence, EPA concludes that triadimenol poses at most a negligible cancer risk to humans and that for
purposes of risk characterization the Reference Dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk.
There are no processed commodities derived from the RACs, wheat straw, barley straw and oat straw, consequently no
corresponding food or feed additive regulations are required. 
The standard risk assessment approach of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to
triadimenol. The provisional acceptable daily intake (PADI) based on the 2-year dog feeding studies (NOEL of 3.75
mg/kg bwt/day), and using a hundredfold uncertainty factor, is calculated to be 0.038 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical
maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances is 0.000448 mg/kg/day and utilizes 1.2 percent
of the PADI for the U.S. population. For nonnursing infants and children, the TMRC represents 2.8 and 2.6 percent of
the PADI, respectively. These tolerances will not change the TMRC or the dietary exposure analysis because the already
established meat and milk tolerances will cover any dietary exposure from the increased tolerances in wheat straw,
barley straw, and oat straw.
The nature of the residue is adequately understood. The residues of concern consist of the parent compound, 

beta

-(4-chlorophenoxy)-

alpha

-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol and its butanediol metabolite, 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2,2-dimethyl-4-(1

H

-1,2,4,-triazol-l-yl)-1,3-butanediol, calculated as parent. Adequate analytical methods are available for
enforcement purposes. Methods are available in the ``Pesticide Analytical Manual,'' Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement
of the tolerances on livestock commodities. The method for plants has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration
for publication in PAM II. Because of the long lead time from establishing this tolerance to publication of the enforcement
methodology in the PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division
(7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office
location and telephone number: Rm. 246, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-4432.
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Amended Tolerance Exemptions for Encapsulating Polymers




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the tolerance exemptions for three encapsulating polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, to remove language not
directly related to the inert ingredient exemption and to replace the specific tolerance exemption listings (40
CFR 180.1104, 180.1105, and 180.1106, respectively) for these polymers with general listings under 40 CFR 180.1001(c).
International Specialty Products requested these changes. The Agency is also amending a similar tolerance exemption
for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer in 40 CFR 180.1001(d) to add additional language to specify
the reaction products and to remove the specific tolerance exemption (40 CFR 180.1039).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32173), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products (ISP),
1361 Alps Rd., Wayne NJ 07470, had submitted petitions to amend the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance
for poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), pesticide petition (PP) 4E4307, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene),
PP 4E4304, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP 4E4306, to remove the specific exemptions in 40 CFR
part 180 for these polymeric encapsulating agents and list them in 40 CFR 180.1001(c).


In addition to the three polymers that were the subject of these petitions, the Agency noted that there was a similar
specific exemption for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer (40 CFR 180.1039) and proposed to amend
this exemption also.

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.

One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter noted that in the 

Federal Register

 of July 21, 1993 (58 FR 38977), EPA removed 40 CFR 180.1039 (cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer) and
replaced it under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) (use as encapsulating agent). The commenter asked whether the current proposal
was intended to replace or be used in addition to the listing finalized in the previous notice.

The commenter is correct that the changes to 40 CFR 180.1039 proposed June 22, 1994 are redundant. The changes finalized
last July, although based on the OPPT polymer exemption, effected the desired outcome. However, in reviewing the
comment, EPA noted several ommissions from the July 21, 1993 notice which are now being corrected: (1) The final notice
did not remove 40 CFR 180.1039, and (2) the general listing for cross-linked polyurea did not specify the reaction
products. As cross-linked polyurea is a general term and may refer to several chemicals and only the specific chemical
described by 40 CFR 180.1039 was reviewed, additional language on the reaction products has been added to the listing
under 40 CFR 180.1001(d).

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Enhanced Motor Vehicle
Inspection and Maintenance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is conditionally approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance
(I/M) program in the counties of Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria, Centre, Chester, Cumberland,
Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Montgomery, Northampton,
Philadelphia, Washington, Westmoreland and York. The intended effect of this action is to conditionally approve
the Pennsylvania enhanced motor vehicle I/M program. This action is being taken under Section 110 of the Clean Air
Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33709), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The NPR proposed conditional approval of an enhanced I/M program based upon certain contingencies. The formal SIP
revision was submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on November 5, 1993. 


Specific requirements of the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program and the rationale for EPA's proposed actions are
explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No adverse public comments were received on the NPR. 


Final Action 


EPA is conditionally approving the enhanced I/M program as a revision to the Pennsylvania SIP based on certain contingencies.
The conditions for approvability are as follows: 
(1) By December 31, 1994 a notice must be published in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT) which certifies that the enhanced I/M
program is required in order to comply with federal law, certifies the geographic areas which are subject to the enhanced
I/M program (the geographic coverage must be identical to that listed in Appendix A-1 of the November 5, 1993
SIP submittal), and certifies the commencement date of the enhanced I/M program. This notice must be submitted to
EPA as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994; 
(2) By December 31, 1994 the Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a SIP amendment, the amendments to the Pennsylvania

purge test procedure and incorporate the transient emission standards for Tier 1 vehicles, the Phase 2 standards
for all vehicle types and model years, and the transient and evaporative purge test procedures found in the final version
of the EPA document entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements,

(3) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for motorist
compliance enforcement program oversight as an amendment to the SIP and 
(4) Within one year from September 30, 1994, the Commonwealth must submit the PADOT procedures manual for quality
assurance as an amendment to the SIP. 
The contingencies for approvability are as follows: 
(1) If penalties are assessed against the contractor under the Contractor Responsibility Program in lieu of the penalties
in 67 Pa Code  178.602(b) of the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, the penalties must be equal to or more stringent
than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation and 
(2) The present contractor or any future contractors for the Pennsylvania I/M program may not have any business interest
in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental United States. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 33709. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received no adverse
public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action
from a Table 1 to a Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 31, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule for the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M SIP revision does not affect the finality of
this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review
may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later
in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; 
State of Tennessee 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this document is to accelerate the effective date for the redesignation of Memphis/Shelby County,
Tennessee, from nonattainment to attainment for the carbon monoxide (CO) air quality standard. EPA previously published
a direct final action redesignating the Memphis/Shelby County CO nonattainment area effective September 26, 1994.
Since no comments were received during the public comment period on that notice and sanctions would otherwise be imposed
for a brief period, this notice makes the redesignation effective immediately. This action stops the sanction clock
and thus prevents sanctions from being imposed on the Memphis/Shelby County area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 26, 1994, EPA published a direct final notice (see 59 FR 37939) redesignating the Memphis/Shelby County area
from nonattainment to attainment for CO. That notice stated the effective date of the redesignation would be September
26, 1994, if no adverse comments were received. No adverse comments have been received. Subsequently, on August 4,
1994, EPA published a rule (see 59 FR 39832) identifying areas with findings in place that would be subject to sanctions
under the Clean Air Act (the Act) as amended in 1990. This action becomes effective on September 6, 1994. The Memphis/Shelby
County, Tennessee, CO nonattainment area was identified as one of the areas which would be subject to sanctions under
section 179(A) of the Act beginning on September 6, 1994. 



The 18-month clock leading to the imposition of these sanctions was started by a letter dated January 15, 1993, in which
EPA found that the State of Tennessee had failed to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for an oxygenated fuels
program and corrections to a basic inspections/maintenance program by November 15, 1992. These sanctions would
be lifted once the redesignation becomes effective. 

Under the timetable established by the August 4, 1994, sanction rule and the July 26, 1994, redesignation notice,
sanctions would be in place from September 6, 1994, to September 26, 1994, the effective date established in the July
26, 1994, redesignation notice. In order to prevent the imposition of sanctions for a three week period on an area whose
redesignation to attainment has been approved, EPA is hereby accelerating the effective date of the redesignation
and making it effective immediately upon publication of this notice. This will alleviate a restriction for which
there is no useful purpose in this instance. 



Final Action 



The EPA published this action on July 26, 1994, (see 59 FR 37939) without prior proposal because the Agency viewed this
as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipated no adverse comments. Since no comments were received the final rule
published on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37939) amending 40 CFR 52.2220 and  81.343 is effective August 31, 1994, under
the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). 

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; decision on petition for reconsideration.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 20, 1994, RSPA amended the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) by designating 15 hazardous substances
as hazardous materials and amending the reportable quantity (RQ) for 34 other hazardous substances already designated
as hazardous materials. Petitioners, metals mining and refining companies, requested that the rule modify the HMR
to except from the hazardous material designation copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates containing small amounts
of lead sulfide, a hazardous substance. Alternatively, petitioners asked that the effective date of the rule be stayed
to allow for the docket to be opened for public comment. The petition is denied. The effective date of that part of the
rule that reduces the RQ for lead sulfide is extended for 90 days.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On June 20, 1994 (59 FR 31822), RSPA amended the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR), 49 CFR parts 171-180,
by revising the ``List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities,'' an Appendix to the Hazardous Materials
Table at 49 CFR 172.101. The rule added 15 hazardous substances to the Appendix and, for 34 other hazardous substances,
reduced the ``Reportable Quantity'' (RQ), the amount of a hazardous substance in a single package that, under 49 CFR
171.8, subjects it to regulation under the HMR. 
The rule implements the mandate under section 306(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9656(a). Section 9602(a) of CERCLA directs the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), through rulemaking, to: (1) Designate as ``hazardous substances'' materials that ``when released
into the environment may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment''; and (2)
establish the RQ for each hazardous substance. The RQ is the amount of a hazardous substance that, if released, requires
notification of the National Response Center. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a). Section 9656(a) directs that each hazardous substance
designated by the EPA ``shall . . . at the time of such listing or designation . . . be
listed and regulated as a hazardous material'' by the Secretary of Transportation under Federal hazardous material
transportation law (Federal hazmat law), 49 U.S.C. 5101 

et seq

. 
The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) carries out the rulemaking responsibilities of the Secretary
of Transportation under 49 U.S.C. 5101 

et seq

. RSPA's June 20, 1994 rule revised the HMR to incorporate additional hazardous substance designations and RQ modifications
made by the EPA in five rulemakings between November 1990 and June 1993 (55 FR 46354, Nov. 2, 1990; 55 FR 50450, Dec. 6,
1990; 57 FR 37194, Aug. 18, 1992; 57 FR 47376, Oct. 15, 1992; 58 FR 35314, June 30, 1993). 
The final rule was issued without public notice or an opportunity for comment. The preamble stated: 
In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), RSPA has determined that a notice of
proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment and review are impracticable and unnecessary. [CERCLA]
mandates that the Department of Transportation list and regulate, as hazardous materials under 49 CFR Parts 171-180,
hazardous substances designated by the EPA under CERCLA. The EPA is the sole agency authorized to designate hazardous
substances and their reportable quantities [RQ's]. Therefore, public comment and review are unnecessary because:
(1) The public was afforded time to comment when the EPA published its notice of proposed rulemaking concerning that
agency's change in the subject RQ's; and (2) RSPA does not have the authority to designate hazardous substances or
determine their reportable quantities. 
A hazardous substance listed in the Appendix to 49 CFR 172.101 is regulated under the HMR as a Class 9 hazardous material,
when an amount equal to or exceeding the RQ of the substance is transported in a single package. 49 CFR 171.8. If the hazardous
substance is in a mixture or in solution, it is regulated only when the concentration of the hazardous substance equals
or exceeds a concentration that depends on the RQ of the substance, as follows:

. A hazardous substance regulated under the HMR as a Class 9 material is subject to requirements governing packaging,
shipping papers, package marking and labelling, vehicle operation, employee training and registration. 

See generally

 49 CFR subpart 107.600; subparts 172.100-172.700; 173.203-173.204; 173.240-173.241; part 177.

The rule is effective August 29, 1994. 


II. The Petition for Reconsideration 


Petitioners ASARCO, Inc., Cominco Ltd., Cyprus Climax Metals Company, Magma Copper Company, Montana Resources,
and Phelps Dodge Mining Company, collectively, engage in the exploration, mining, milling, smelting and refining
of metals including copper, molybdenum and zinc. In the course of their activity, petitioners offer for transportation
and transport significant quantities of copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates. Petitioners' concentrates
contain lead sulfide in a concentration between 0.001 and 2.0 percent. 
Petitioners request reconsideration of the June 20, 1994 rule because it incorporates the EPA's reduction of the
lead sulfide RQ from 5,000 to 10 pounds (58 FR 35314, June 30, 1993), and thereby, through operation of the  171.8
mixture rule, subjects to regulation under the HMR certain of petitioners' copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates
that until now have not been regulated. 
Petitioners represent that the lead sulfide in the copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates is of low bioavailability
 and that these concentrates currently are being shipped safely, and contend on that basis that there is no need to regulate
the concentrates as hazardous materials. Petitioners cite several types of costs that they will incur from designation
of the concentrates as hazardous materials and suggest that, contrary to RSPA's finding in the rule's preamble, 59
FR 31823, the economic impact of the rule is not minimal. 




Petitioners assert that few U.S. ports accept bulk shipments of concentrates, and that of those that do, many would
not if the concentrates were designated hazardous materials. Petitioners say they have been informed by officials
of the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, that the port no longer would accept bulk shipments of copper and zinc concentrates,
if designated as hazardous materials. Petitioners state that if the rule is not modified to except their concentrates
from the hazardous material designation, they might need to ship the concentrates through Canadian or Mexican ports,
adding millions of dollars annually to their shipping costs. Petitioners suggest that this rerouting, by increasing
the distances over which the concentrates are shipped, would increase the risk of accident and release of these materials.
Petitioners also suggest that a decision by U.S. ports not to handle these materials could result in job losses among
port workers. 
Second, petitioners predict that concentrates designated as hazardous materials would be subject to shipping surcharges
and shipping rate increases. 
Third, petitioners cite the general costs of compliance with HMR packaging, shipping paper, marking, labelling,
placarding and employee training requirements. (Note: As Class 9 materials, petitioners' concentrates would not
be required to be placarded in domestic transportation. 49 CFR 172.504(f)(9).) 
Finally, petitioners suggest that the rule is inconsistent with international regulations that, according to petitioners,
do not subject the concentrates in question to similar regulation. This, say petitioners, runs counter to RSPA's
and DOT's policy to seek a uniform global regulatory framework for hazardous material transportation. 
Petitioners assert that the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) mandate to list and regulate hazardous substances as hazardous materials
does not supersede RSPA's delegated authority under 49 U.S.C. 5103 to designate as hazardous materials those materials
that ``in a particular amount and form may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property.'' Petitioners
concede that  9656(a) requires RSPA both to designate lead sulfide as a hazardous material and to recognize
the 10-pound RQ for lead sulfide established by the EPA, but assert that this directive does not constrain RSPA's discretion
to determine the threshold concentration at which a particular mixture containing lead sulfide is to be regulated
as a hazardous material. Petitioners suggest that the mixture table at 49 CFR 171.8 is a comparable exercise of discretion,
and that RSPA simply can modify the table in a way that excludes their concentrates from a hazardous material designation.

Procedurally, petitioners take issue with RSPA's failure to provide for public notice and comment before issuing
the rule. They argue that notice and comment was not ``impracticable'' since the rule was not issued until a year after
the EPA rule revising the RQ for lead sulfide. They contend that comment was not ``unnecessary'' because: (1) The opportunity
to comment during the EPA rulemaking did not encompass the transportation-related ramifications of the EPA action;
and (2) RSPA 

does 

have the statutory authority to decide what quantity and form of materials in transportation may pose an unacceptable
risk to health, safety or property.

Petitioners request that RSPA modify the mixture table at 49 CFR 171.8 to provide that copper, molybdenum and zinc
concentrates with less than 10 percent lead sulfide by weight are not hazardous materials. In the alternative, petitioners
ask that the August 29, 1994 effective date of the rule be stayed, and that the docket be reopened for public notice and
comment. 


III. Decision 


The petition for reconsideration is denied. RSPA's statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) to ``list[] and regulate[]
as a hazardous material'' each hazardous substance designated by the EPA under 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) does not give RSPA
the discretion to grant the relief petitioners seek. 


A. History of RSPA Hazardous Substance Regulation 


RSPA first subjected hazardous substances to regulation as hazardous materials in a May 22, 1980 final rule (45 FR
34560). This rule, issued before CERCLA was enacted, was to assist the transportation industry in complying with
section 311(b)(5) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1321(b). Section 1321(b)(2), a forerunner
to 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) that remains as an independent EPA authority, directs the EPA Administrator to: (1) Designate
as a hazardous substance any material that, when discharged to the navigable waters or contiguous zone, ``present[s]
an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare''; and (2) establish as the RQ for each hazardous
substance the quantity of that substance that, if discharged, ``may be harmful'' to the public health or welfare or
the environment. Section 1321(b)(5) requires the operator of a facility from which a hazardous substance in excess
of its RQ is discharged to report the discharge to the National Response Center. The statute imposes cleanup liability
on the operator, and criminal and civil penalties for failure to report the discharge. Motor vehicles and rolling
stock are ``facilities'' under the statute. 33 U.S.C. 1321(a)(10). 
The 1980 RSPA rule sought to address transportation industry concerns that a motor vehicle or train operator might
be subject to criminal penalties for failing to report a discharge without being clearly on notice that the cargo included
hazardous substances. 44 FR 10676-77 (Feb. 22, 1979) (notice of proposed rulemaking). The rule amended the
HMR to designate hazardous substances as hazardous materials, to require that a hazardous substance be identified
on the shipping paper accompanying the package, and to impose a package marking requirement. These measures were
to ensure the operator's awareness that a hazardous substance was on board. The rule also specified general standards
of integrity for the container in which the hazardous substance is transported. 
Because the FWPCA reporting requirement applies only to the discharge of a hazardous substance in an amount that exceeds
its RQ, the rule limited the application of the HMR to hazardous substance transportation in two ways that remain in
the rule today. First, a hazardous substance is a hazardous material, and therefore regulated under the HMR, only
when the hazardous substance is being transported in an amount (in a single package) in excess of its RQ. 49 CFR 171.8.
Second, whether transportation of a hazardous substance in a mixture or in solution is subject to the HMR as a hazardous
material is determined by the concentration of the hazardous substance in the mixture or solution. 

Id. 

The minimum concentration subjecting the mixture or solution to regulation as a hazardous material is proportional
to the RQ of the hazardous substance; the higher the RQ, the greater the concentration of hazardous substance permitted
before the material is regulated. These two provisions are those to which petitioners point in arguing that RSPA has
the discretion to exclude copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates from the HMR. 
CERCLA was enacted on December 11, 1980. Pub. L. 96-510, 94 Stat. 2767. The statute incorporates the FWPCA requirement
to report a release of a hazardous substance in excess of its RQ and the sanctions for failing to do so. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a),
9603(b), 9609. It establishes, for discharge reporting and other purposes, a broader definition of ``hazardous
substance'' than that under 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2). The definition includes hazardous substances designated by the
EPA under 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2), but also specifies as hazardous substances materials of environmental concern listed
under the FWPCA at 33 U.S.C. 1317(a); the Solid Waste Disposal Act at 42 U.S.C. 6921; the Clean Air Act at 42 U.S.C. 7412;
and the Toxic Substances Control Act at 15 U.S.C. 2606. 42 U.S.C. 9601(14). Section 9602(a) of CERCLA, like 33 U.S.C.
1321(b)(2), authorizes the EPA Administrator to: (1) Designate as a hazardous substance any other material that,
in the Administrator's judgment, ``may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment''
if released; and (2) establish an RQ for that material. Section 9602(b) assigns to those hazardous substances incorporated
into CERCLA from other Federal statutes a ``default'' RQ of one pound until the EPA, through rulemaking, specifies
a different RQ. 
Section 9656(a) of CERCLA, as enacted, directed the Secretary of Transportation as follows: 
Each hazardous substance which is listed or designated as provided in section 101(14) of this Act (42 U.S.C. 9601(14))
shall, within ninety days after the date of enactment of this Act or at the time of such listing or designation, whichever
is later, be listed as a hazardous material under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (now codified at 49 U.S.C.
5101 

et seq.

). 
With the enactment of CERCLA, the section 9601(14) definition immediately added to the list of hazardous substances
a number of substances with a default RQ of one pound. On March 19, 1981 (46 FR 17738), RSPA issued a final rule to implement
the section 9656(a) directive. In the agency's judgment, regulating the transportation of a single pound of many
of the listed hazardous substances would not be practical or cost-effective. To comply with the language of section
9656(a), RSPA listed these hazardous substances as hazardous materials, but did not regulate them. In denying a subsequent
petition for reconsideration, RSPA explained its authority for listing but not regulating: 
[I]t was the intent of Congress in enacting [ 9656] that, once DOT has listed the materials subject to CERCLA
as hazardous materials, DOT retain [sic] the discretion provided by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act
to determine whether, and to what extent, those materials should be regulated.

46 FR 58086 (Nov. 30, 1981); 

see also 

48 FR 35965, 35969 (Aug. 8, 1983) (advance notice of proposed rulemaking) (affirming RSPA's discretion as to whether
and how to regulate hazardous substances under Federal hazmat law). 
In response to RSPA's decision not to regulate certain hazardous substances at a one-pound RQ, Congress amended section
9656(a) to direct that hazardous substances, when designated by the EPA, be ``listed 

and regulated

'' as hazardous materials. Pub. L. 99-499, section 202 (Oct. 17, 1986) (emphasis added). This is the present
language of the statute. 
In accordance with the amendment, RSPA issued a final rule on November 21, 1986, subjecting all hazardous substances
listed under 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) to the shipping paper, package marking and packaging requirements applicable to
hazardous substances under the 1980 rule. The agency, citing its lack of discretion in complying with the statutory
mandate, found that public notice and comment were unnecessary and issued the final rule directly. 
As the EPA has designated additional hazardous substances or changed the RQ for those already designated, RSPA, without
public notice or an opportunity for public comment, has issued final rules incorporating those changes into the HMR.
The present rule is the fourth of these (see preceding rules at 54 FR 34666, Aug. 21, 1989; 54 FR 39500, Sept. 26, 1989;
55 FR 46794, Nov. 7, 1990). With the exception of training and registration requirements established by statute for
hazardous materials as a whole, the HMR requirements that apply to the bulk transportation of hazardous substances
designated as hazardous materials have not changed substantially since 1980. 


B. RSPA Discretion To Regulate Hazardous Substances 


RSPA's discretion in implementing 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) is limited in two important respects. 
First, the directive to ``list and regulate'' each hazardous substance as a hazardous material requires RSPA, at
the least, to provide a regulatory framework to ensure that a motor vehicle or train operator has a means to know when
the cargo includes a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance. As discussed above, RSPA's May 1980 rule, subjecting
hazardous substance transportation to hazardous material shipping paper and package marking requirements, was
issued to this end in order to implement FWPCA discharge reporting requirements. Seven months later, Congress enacted
CERCLA, essentially incorporating the FWPCA hazardous substance discharge reporting requirement. Furthermore,
the CERCLA legislative history reveals a congressional intent to adopt and enhance the FWPCA framework for preventing
and mitigating oil and hazardous substance spills. 

See generally 

H.Rep. 96-1016(II), 1980 USCCAN 6151, 6160-6223 (incorporating H.Rep. 96-172). Therefore, RSPA
reads section 9656(a) to have codified the basic purpose of the RSPA rule, that of providing carriers the knowledge
of their cargo needed to comply with CERCLA reporting requirements. Accordingly, RSPA has no discretion to modify
the HMR framework in a way that undermines the operator notification function of the shipping paper and marking requirements.
Congress' 1986 amendment to require both listing 

and regulation

 of EPA-designated hazardous substances is further evidence of RSPA's limited discretion. 
Second, the regulatory framework under Federal hazmat law historically has been oriented toward those materials
that, in transportation, present immediate hazards to public health, safety and property by virtue of qualities
such as explosivity, flammability, reactivity, acute toxicity, radioactivity and corrosivity. RSPA, in coordination
with the Department of Transportation (DOT) modal administrations (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad
Administration, United States Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration), possesses the expertise and
the resources to assess the physical and chemical properties of materials in transportation; to weigh the costs and
benefits of proposed regulations; and to make considered regulatory judgments.

RSPA exercises its discretion more narrowly in regulating materials that may pose longer-term harm to humans or other
animals, or harm to the environment. As RSPA noted in 1980, in its first notice of proposed rulemaking to regulate hazardous
substances as hazardous materials: 

DOT should not attempt to develop the criteria for materials that are subject to the FWPCA unless they fall within the
realm of the existing defining criteria for materials presently designated as hazardous materials. (RSPA) believes
the EPA has both the expertise and the technical resources necessary to deal with the determination and designation
of those materials which should be considered for inclusion in the reporting requirement mandated by the FWPCA.




44 FR 10677. 



The assignment of authority under the FWPCA and CERCLA between DOT and the EPA reflects the agencies' relative areas
of expertise and resources. Both 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) direct the EPA Administrator to designate
as hazardous substances those materials that may substantially endanger public health or the environment, and to
establish for each the RQ that determines which hazardous substance releases must be reported. Both the decision
to designate a material as a hazardous substance and the choice of an RQ are matters for the exercise of the EPA Administrator's
broad discretion. The assignment to RSPA under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), conversely, is strictly confined: if the EPA has
designated a material as a hazardous substance, RSPA must list it and regulate its transportation. 

The rulemaking challenged by petitioners was preceded by a notice and comment rulemaking in which the EPA affirmed
its designation of lead sulfide as a hazardous substance, and determined that on the basis of chronic toxicity, the
lead sulfide in petitioners' concentrates warranted assignment of an RQ of 10 pounds. 58 FR 35316. If RSPA were to consider
petitioners' argument that the low bioavailability of the lead sulfide in their concentrates justifies excepting
the concentrates from the hazardous material designation, the result would be untenable. In every rulemaking under
section 9656(a), RSPA would be required to consider, on a cost-benefit basis, the appropriate level of Federal hazmat
regulation for each hazardous substance designated by the EPA and the appropriateness of excluding certain forms
of hazardous substances from regulation entirely. Costs and benefits could not be estimated without RSPA independently
assessing the health and environmental risks that a hazardous substance posed. The statute cannot reasonably intend
that each hazardous substance and RQ designation, determined by the EPA through consideration of public comment
and the exercise of its own expert judgment, be subject to full reconsideration by RSPA before it is incorporated into
the HMR. This reading would be contrary to the statutory recognition of agency expertise and all notions of executive
branch efficiency and consistency. 

RSPA does have discretion as to precisely how it regulates hazardous substances in transportation. Regulation may
be extensive or minimal. Vehicle operating requirements, segregation requirements and routing restrictions might
be imposed, or shipping paper and package notations might suffice. RSPA's task is to formulate a principle that reconciles
(1) the EPA's authority to adjudge public health and environmental risk by designating hazardous substances and
their RQ's with (2) RSPA's inescapable discretion to determine the specific requirements that apply to the transportation
of each hazardous substance. 

The guiding principle is this: RSPA, in its discretion, may prescribe reasonable requirements to govern the safe
transportation of hazardous substances, so long as those requirements do not, in effect, revisit the EPA's assessment
of health and environmental risks. In practice, this means that RSPA may exercise discretion under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a)
in three respects: (1) It may prescribe regulations for the transportation of hazardous substances 

as a class

; (2) it may regulate differently hazardous substances with different RQ's; and (3) it may regulate hazardous substances
by class on the basis of shared characteristics other than the degree of health or environmental risk posed. 



C. Petitioners' Substantive Claims 



Petitioners contend that although RSPA must ``list and regulate'' all hazardous substances as hazardous materials,
it has the discretion to except copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates from the hazardous material designation.
In support of this claim, petitioners suggest that RSPA already has exercised this sort of discretion under 49 CFR
171.8, by: (1) Regulating hazardous substances only when transported in excess of their RQ's; and (2) not regulating
mixtures and solutions containing a hazardous substance, when the hazardous substance is below a specified concentration.
Petitioners ask that RSPA merely amend the rule governing mixtures and solutions to increase the concentration of
lead sulfide that must be present in their concentrates before they are considered hazardous materials. 

Petitioners argue that the exception from regulation for hazardous substances in amounts below their RQ's and for
those in mixtures or solutions below the specified concentration proves that RSPA has the discretion to disregard
the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) command to ``list and regulate'' each hazardous substance. These exceptions, however, do not
contravene the statute, but implement it. As discussed above, the primary purpose of section 9656(a) is to provide
for identification of cargo subject to CERCLA reporting requirements if released. There is no need to regulate a hazardous
substance being transported in an amount below its RQ, because no reportable release could occur during transportation.
42 U.S.C. 9603(b); 

cf. 

33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(5). The provision setting a minimum concentration for designating as a hazardous material a hazardous
substance in a mixture or in solution is to simplify the operator's task of determining whether an RQ of a hazardous
substance is present. 45 FR 34569; 44 FR 10676-77. 

Further, the statute requires reporting of a hazardous substance release only when the release equals or exceeds
the RQ of the substance. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a). This is an implied finding that the release of a limited quantity of a hazardous
substance is of lesser regulatory concern. 

Cf

. 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(4) (defining the RQ as the quantity of a hazardous substance ``which may be harmful'' to the public
health or welfare or the environment).

<TEXT>
 

Thus, the command to regulate the transportation of ``each hazardous substance'' need not be read to require the regulation
of hazardous substances transported in any amount or concentration. In view of the costs attending regulation,  9656(a)
is best read to require the regulation of hazardous substances in transportation only in amounts that, if spilled,
require notification of the National Response Center. For shipments in a single package of 50,000 pounds or less,
the  171.8 rule for mixtures and solutions is a simple means to determine that the lading does not amount to an
RQ of a hazardous substance. A small number of shipments of more than 50,000 pounds of a hazardous substance in a mixture
or in solution may be excluded from regulation despite containing more than an RQ of the hazardous substance. A regulation
that implements a general statutory command, however, cannot avoid some degree of both over- and underregulation.
In light of the operator liability concerns underpinning the  9656(a) mandate, underregulation was remedied
by the EPA's concurrence in the rule, and its issuance of a notice that carriers complying with reporting requirements
in accordance with the RSPA rule would be deemed to have met FWPCA reporting requirements. 45 FR 61617 (Sept. 17, 1980);


see also

 45 FR 74642 (Nov. 10, 1980). The two limitations of 49 CFR 171.8 establish, directly or by approximation, a regulatory
threshold at the RQ, and are a reasoned interpretation of the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) mandate. 

The EPA treats mixtures and solutions of a hazardous substance differently under CERCLA than RSPA treats them under
49 CFR 171.8. 

See

 40 CFR 302.6. RSPA's and the EPA's approaches differ not because RSPA is second-guessing the EPA as to the health and
environmental risks posed by hazardous substances in mixture or solution, but because the agencies simplified in
different ways the operator's determination of whether an RQ of a hazardous substance is present. Congress amended
 9656(a) in 1986 to correct RSPA's failure to regulate hazardous substances with statutory one-pound RQ's,
but did not take issue with these two aspects of 49 CFR 171.8. This is further evidence that the regulation is consistent
with statutory intent. 

With respect to the allocation of authority between RSPA and the EPA, these two elements of  171.8 are consistent
with the principle set forth in section III.B, above. The RQ is the regulatory threshold for all hazardous substances;
the treatment of hazardous substance mixtures and solutions makes distinctions only between hazardous substances
with different RQ's. Each element fully respects the EPA's hazardous substance and RQ designations and its assessment
of the comparative health and environmental concerns of each hazardous substance. 

In contrast, the action that petitioners ask RSPA to take is not within RSPA's discretion in either respect. Petitioners
concede that RSPA is obligated to list lead sulfide as a hazardous material with an RQ of 10 pounds, but ask that certain
lead sulfide mixtures be designated as hazardous materials only at a concentration of 10 percent or greater, while
other lead sulfide mixtures, as well as other mixtures containing a hazardous substance with an RQ of 10 pounds, are
hazardous materials at a hazardous substance concentration of 0.02 percent. Contrary to the section 9656(a) mandate,
this would permit the transportation of up to 500 times the RQ of lead sulfide in a single packaging (more, if concentrates
are transported in bulk in a quantity above 50,000 pounds) without requiring identification of the lading as a hazardous
substance. Carriers nevertheless would remain subject to the CERCLA reporting requirement, and to civil and criminal
sanctions for failing to comply with it. As well, it would convert the  171.8 mixture rule from a means to simplify
the operator's computation of whether an RQ is present to a means of disregarding the EPA's conclusion, expressed
in the designation of a 10-pound RQ, as to the relative risks that lead sulfide poses to the public health and the environment.


The foundation of petitioners' claim is that the lead sulfide in their copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates is
not bioavailable, and that these concentrates are being subjected to a regulatory regime not warranted by the public
health and environmental risk that they pose. RSPA's discretion does not extend to excepting lead sulfide from the
hazardous material designation on the basis of its own assessment of health and environmental risks. Petitioners'
claim properly was before the EPA during its rulemaking to consider adjusting the RQ for lead sulfide. In that rulemaking,
the issue of lead sulfide bioavailability was directly raised by commenters and considered by the EPA. 

See

 letters in EPA Docket 102RQ-31L from the American Mining Congress (July 7, 1992; document 3-22); Hecla
Mining Company (June 17, 1992; document 3-6); Lead Industries Association (July 7, 1992; doc. 3-21);
Charlotte Biblow (July 7, 1992; doc. 3-13); EPA responses to comments at document 4-1 and 58 FR 35319-20.
The EPA determined not to except petitioners' form of lead sulfide from designation as a hazardous substance, and
assigned lead sulfide in all forms, including petitioners', an RQ of 10 pounds. 58 FR 35314. RSPA may not revisit the
EPA's conclusion.

Petitioners argue that the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) mandate does not supersede RSPA's delegated authority to designate
as hazardous materials only those materials that ``in a particular amount and form may pose an unreasonable risk to
health and safety or property.'' 49 U.S.C. 5103. Petitioners are correct that RSPA's designation of a hazardous material
under  5103 must rest on a finding that the material may pose the type and degree of risk stated. The authority
to make that finding carries with it a range of discretion, so that ordinarily a rulemaking to designate a hazardous
material under  5103 requires public notice and an opportunity for comment. Section 9656(a) of CERCLA, however,
does not compel RSPA to designate hazardous substances as hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5103. Rather, it imposes
an independent, direct rulemaking mandate. Under a section 9656(a) rulemaking, RSPA need not, and indeed may not,
inquire as to whether a particular hazardous substance, in a particular amount and form, ``may pose an unreasonable
risk to health and safety or property.'' Section 9656(a) already has decided the substance's status as a hazardous
material. 


As stated above, RSPA does have the authority under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) to modify the set of HMR requirements applicable
to hazardous substances as a class. In a rulemaking to consider modifying the HMR, RSPA would examine both the statutory
purposes of the hazardous material designation under section 9656(a) (e.g., providing a means for motor vehicle
and train operators to know that potentially they are subject to CERCLA reporting requirements) and the costs and
benefits of regulatory alternatives. These options are not within the scope of this rulemaking and, to the extent
petitioners seek to avoid the hazardous material designation entirely, would not provide petitioners the relief
they seek. 

Petitioners do not document their claims as to the safe transportation history of copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates;
the limited public health and environmental risk of those concentrates; or the consequences of the June 20, 1994 rule
for, and significance of the costs to, the mining industry. Further, it is not at all clear that the bulk of petitioners'
alleged costs, attributable to the voluntary business decisions of private port operators, are cognizable in an
agency's consideration of the costs and benefits of its rules. Regardless, because RSPA does not have the discretion
to consider the factual basis for petitioners' request, the lack of documentation and the question of the status of
petitioners' costs are not material. 



D. Procedural Claims 



Petitioners object to RSPA's failure to provide public notice and an opportunity for comment before issuing the final
rule. Specifically, they challenge RSPA's finding, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), that public notice and comment
were not required because notice and comment would have been impractical and unnecessary. 

Petitioners assert that because the rule was issued nearly a year after the EPA rulemaking establishing the reduced
lead sulfide RQ, allowing for notice and comment would not have been impractical. Section 9656(a) mandates that the
RSPA final rule designating a hazardous substance as a hazardous material be issued ``at the time'' that the EPA publishes
the hazardous substance designation. It can be argued that this language establishes the impracticality of public
notice and comment as a matter of law. Nevertheless, petitioners' argument that an opportunity for public comment
could have been provided 

in this case 

certainly is correct. Regardless, public notice and an opportunity for comment were not required because they were
unnecessary. 


As elaborated above, RSPA, contrary to petitioners' argument, does not have the authority in this rulemaking to decide,
on the basis of health and environmental effects, what quantities and forms of lead sulfide should be designated as
hazardous materials. Public comment was unnecessary because it could not have changed the final rule. 



IV. Extension of Effective Date 



Petitioners indicate that it may be necessary to adjust shipping arrangements for copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates
that as a result of the rule will be designated as hazardous materials. The effective date of that part of the rule that
reduces the lead sulfide RQ from 5,000 to 10 pounds is changed from August 29, 1994 to November 29, 1994, to allow petitioners
sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements and otherwise to prepare to comply with the rule. No other regulated
party has indicated that the August 29, 1994 effective date poses a problem. Therefore, except with respect to the
RQ reduction for lead sulfide, the effective date of the rule remains August 29, 1994.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that an emergency exists in the groundfish fisheries being conducted in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA).
To preserve a significant economic opportunity that otherwise might be foregone, NMFS is reopening the sablefish
hook-and-line fishery in certain areas of the GOA during the September 12-14, 1994, opening of the Pacific halibut
fishery. NMFS is also increasing the directed fishing standard for sablefish in the Southeast Outside District of
the GOA during this same time period and is establishing the framework authority to allow an increase in the directed
fishing standard for sablefish during any subsequent opening of a Pacific halibut fishery. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA. The FMP was prepared by the North
Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.
1801 

et seq.

) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 672. General
regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
At times, amendments to the FMP or its implementing regulations are necessary to respond to fishery conservation
and management problems that cannot be addressed within the time frame of the normal procedures provided for by the
Magnuson Act. Section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act authorizes the Secretary to implement emergency regulations necessary
to address these situations. These emergency regulations may remain in effect for 90 days, with a possible 90-day
extension. 
The 1994 directed sablefish hook-and-line fishery was open for 10 days in May. During this opening the halibut prohibited
species catch (PSC) limit was reached, but the full sablefish hook-and-line total allowable catch (TAC) amount in
the GOA was not harvested. Regulations at  672.20(f)(3)(ii) prohibit directed fishing for groundfish by vessels
using hook-and-line gear once the halibut PSC limit, annually specified for vessels using this gear type, is reached.

Accordingly, the GOA was closed to directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using hook-and-line gear (other than
demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District) under  672.20(f)(3)(ii) from May 28 to December
31, 1994 (59 FR 17737, April 14, 1994; 59 FR 43296, August 23, 1994). However, 6,479 metric tons (mt), or 30 percent,
of the 1994 sablefish hook-and-line quota share remains unharvested. Regulations implementing directed fishing
standards for sablefish ( 672.20(g)(4)(i)) limit retention of this species on a vessel in the hook-and-line
fisheries to less than 4 percent of the total amount of all other fish species retained at the same time on the vessel
during a fishing trip. The remaining amount of sablefish TAC specified for vessels using hook-and-line gear exceeds
potential bycatch needs in the hook-and-line fisheries for nongroundfish. 
The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) has announced a 48-hour opening of the Pacific halibut fishery
from 12 noon Alaska local time (A.l.t.) September 12, 1994 to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994. The halibut opening
provides the opportunity for NMFS to reopen the sablefish fishery to allow some of the remaining sablefish TAC to be
harvested and revenue to be generated that would otherwise be foregone had the halibut fishery not been opened in September.
The IPHC supports a concurrent halibut/sablefish opening in September. 
This emergency rule: (1) Opens the GOA sablefish hook-and-line fishery in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas
and the West Yakutat district of the Eastern Regulatory Area for the duration of the September Pacific halibut fishery
opening, (2) increases the directed fishing standard for sablefish in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern
Regulatory Area of the GOA for the duration of the September Pacific halibut fishery opening, and (3) establishes
authority for the Regional Director to increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish during any subsequent
opening of the halibut fishery. Details of this emergency rule follow. 


Sablefish Management 


This emergency rule: (1) Opens the sablefish hook-and-line fishery to directed fishing in the Western and Central
Regulatory Areas and in the West Yakutat District of the Eastern Regulatory Area from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12,
1994, to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994; and (2) increases the retainable bycatch amounts of sablefish to 30 percent
in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12, 1994, to 12 noon
A.l.t. September 14, 1994. 
The unanticipated circumstances of the May 1994 sablefish fishery left a significant amount (6,479 mt) of sablefish
TAC unharvested. A concurrent halibut/sablefish opening would allow optimum utilization of both species. The legal-sized
halibut that might be caught in the directed sablefish fishery would be attributed to the IPHC halibut quota. 
Sablefish will remain closed to directed fishing with hook-and-line gear in the Southeast Outside District of the
Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA during the September 12-14 halibut opening. Not enough sablefish TAC remains
in the Southeast Outside District to support a directed fishery. However, because 455 mt of sablefish remain unharvested
in the Southeast Outside District, NMFS will increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish from the current
4 percent to 30 percent from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12 to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994. The current 4 percent retainable
bycatch amount would only allow approximately 109 mt of sablefish to be harvested. Based on NMFS' calculations, an
increase in the bycatch retention limit to 30 percent would allow harvest of most of the remaining sablefish in the
Southeast Outside District. This would provide increased revenue for that sector of the sablefish industry that
fishes in the Southeast Outside District.

<TEXT>
 

The IPHC, in conjunction with NMFS, determined that the optimum length for the concurrent halibut/sablefish opening
would be 2 days in the Western and Central Areas and in the West Yakutat District. The halibut that is caught as bycatch
in the sablefish fishery will be counted against the Pacific halibut quota. A minimal amount of unavoidable discards
of undersized halibut will occur in the sablefish fishery. The IPHC estimates that minimal discards of halibut in
the directed sablefish fishery could also occur as a result of operators of vessels participating in either fishery
attaining their halibut trip limits. However, these discards would not be expected to exceed 10 mt. 
Based on the daily catch rate of sablefish in the May 1994 directed sablefish fishery, the September sablefish fishery
could potentially harvest 90, 1246, and 542 mt (round-weight equivalent) in the Western, Central, and West Yakutat
areas, respectively. The headed-and-gutted (Eastern cut) sablefish product is valued at approximately $2.00/lb
(or $4.40/kg). 
To determine an approximate value of the expected sablefish harvest in September, the anticipated round-weight
harvest amount (in pounds) is multiplied by a product recovery rate of 0.63 to convert the weight to a headed-and-gutted
weight equivalent. This value is multiplied by the $2.00/lb ($4.40/kg), headed-and-gutted value for the sablefish.
Using these calculations, the Western, Central, and West Yakutat Areas could potentially generate approximately
$250,000, $3,461,000, and $1,506,000, respectively, during the 2-day September opening. This would bring an additional
revenue of approximately $5,217,000 to the GOA sablefish industry without significantly increasing halibut discards.
Complete harvest of the remaining TAC amount of 455 mt in the Southeast Outside District, under the revised directed
fishing standards, would contribute an additional $1,264,000 to the sablefish revenue, for a total of $6,481,000.

The value of dressed, head-off halibut is estimated to be $1.50/lb (or $3.30/kg). Based on the price difference for
halibut and sablefish, a significant number of vessels would likely target on sablefish during the concurrent 2-day
opening. 



Framework Authority to Increase the Directed Fishing Standard 


This emergency rule also establishes the authority for the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) to
increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish ( 672.20(g)(4)(iii)) during any subsequent opening
of the halibut fishery. The directed fishing standard for sablefish could be increased in areas closed to directed
fishing for sablefish, based on the following criteria: (1) The increase would occur in a GOA regulatory area or district
and during a time period that the IPHC has authorized an opening for Pacific halibut, under 50 CFR part 301; (2) a sufficient
amount of sablefish TAC would remain unharvested in the area to support an increased harvest of sablefish consistent
with any increase in the directed fishing standard for this species; and (3) the duration of the Pacific halibut fishery
opening and the anticipated fishing effort would not result in an overharvest of a sablefish TAC. 
Establishment of the framework authority would give NMFS the flexibility to allow further harvest of sablefish and
hence increase revenue. 
NMFS concurs that the above regulatory measures must be implemented by emergency rulemaking to provide the economic
opportunity for the sablefish industry to realize revenue that would otherwise be foregone had a directed sablefish
fishery not been authorized in September 1994. Comments on this action are invited through September 15, 1954. (See


ADDRESSES

). 



Classification 


This rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
because it is issued without opportunity for prior public comment, and none has been prepared. 
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds that the immediate need to provide an opportunity to
optimize the harvest of sablefish in conjunction with the IPHC announcement of the re-opening of the Pacific halibut
fishery in September constitutes good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an opportunity for
public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), as such procedures would be impracticable.
Further, the AA finds that the re-opening of the directed fishery, increase in the directed fishing standard for sablefish,
and the regulatory amendment, relieve a restriction and, therefore, pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
this rule is effective concurrent with the re-opening of the Pacific halibut fishery.

local time (A.l.t.) September 12, 1994, to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994, in the Western and Central Regulatory
Areas and the West Yakutat District of the Eastern Regulatory Area. 

(C) 

Demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District.

 If, during the year, the Regional Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels using hook-and-line
gear in the directed fishery for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District will reach the halibut
bycatch allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for this fishery under paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, NMFS will publish a document in the 

Federal Register

 prohibiting directed fishing for demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District by vessels using hook-and-line

(iii) 

Sablefish.

 (A) Except as provided under paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section, the operator of a vessel is engaged
in directed fishing for sablefish if he retains at any particular time during a trip sablefish caught using hook-and-line
gear in an amount equal to or greater than 4 percent of the total amount of all other fish species retained at the same
time by the vessel during the same trip. 

(B) In the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area during the time period from 12 noon Alaska local
time (A.l.t.) September 12, 1994 to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994, the operator of a vessel is engaged in directed
fishing for sablefish if he retains at any particular time during a trip sablefish caught using hook-and-line gear
in an amount equal to or greater than 30 percent of the total amount of all other fish species retained at the same time
by the vessel during the same trip. 

(C) The Regional Director may increase, by publication of a document in the 

Federal Register

, the directed fishing standard for sablefish for an area of the Gulf of Alaska for which directed fishing for sablefish
is closed, provided that: 

(

1

) The increase would occur in a Gulf of Alaska regulatory area or district and during a time that the International Pacific
Halibut Commission has authorized an opening for Pacific halibut, under 50 CFR part 301; 

(

2

) A sufficient amount of sablefish total allowable catch would remain unharvested in the area to support an increased
harvest of sablefish consistent with any increase in the directed fishing standard for this species; and 

(

3

) The duration of the Pacific halibut fishery opening and the anticipated fishing effort would not result in an overharvest
of a sablefish total allowable catch amount.

ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending its regulations on carriage of bulk hazardous materials. These amendments assign additional
carriage requirements, a higher Pollution Category, or both to certain commodities already listed in the tables.
These amendments are necessary to align the minimum requirements in the table with those approved by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) for inclusion in its Chemical Codes applicable to tankships. Additionally, the Coast
Guard is making various revisions to correct past errors.

Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Curtis G. Payne, Project Manager, and Ms. Helen G.
Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.


Related Rulemakings


On April 11, 1994, the Coast Guard published a final rule (FR) entitled Bulk Hazardous Materials in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16999) updating its chemical tables to reflect the International Maritime Organization's (IMO's) final and
provisional determinations, with the exception of ``upgrades'' to entries currently in the IMO Chemical Code.
On October 17, 1991, the Coast Guard published a final rule entitled ``Benzene'' in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 52122) which became effective January 15, 1992. On December 13, 1991, the Coast Guard published a correction
to that final rule entitled ``Benzene; Correction'' in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 65005) which became effective January 15, 1992.
Elsewhere in this edition of the 

Federal Register

, the Coast Guard is publishing a final rule concerning upgrades to the noxious liquid substances lists in 33 CFR 151.47
and 151.49 (CGD 94-901). Also in this edition of the 

Federal Register

, a notice and request for comments (CGD 94-902) is published concerning cargo entries the Coast Guard has reason to
believe are obsolete.


Background and Purpose


This rulemaking updates various Coast Guard hazardous materials tables in 46 CFR parts 30, 150, 151, and 153 to include
``upgrades'' to requirements authorized by Coast Guard regulations or international law. An ``upgrade'' means
that a commodity is assigned additional carriage requirements, a higher Pollution Category (Pol. Cat.), or both.
The upgrades assigned by this final rule were determined by the IMO for inclusion in the IMO Chemical Codes (``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC Code), and ``Code for
the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (BCH Code)). Adoption of these upgrades
in the Coast Guard regulations is necessary to ensure consistency with international law. These upgrades were included,
for informational purposes, in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM published on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29937).
At that time, the IMO had determined the upgrades, but were not scheduled to become effective until July 1, 1994. The
upgrades, with brief explanations where helpful, are shown in a table in the Discussion of Amendments section below.
The corrections and editorial revisions included in this rule are also discussed below.


Discussion of Amendments


(a) Benzene and benzene containing cargoes. Concurrent with the ``upgrade'' actions, the IMO has revised the gauging
requirement for benzene and benzene containing cargoes to ``closed''. This revision has been based upon the known
human health hazards posed by the chemical benzene. Today's rulemaking incorporates this revision in both the Coast
Guard's tankship table of minimum requirements, table 1, part 153 as well as its tank barge table of minimum requirements,
table 151.05, part 151. Compliance with the tankship requirements must be met as of the effective date of this rule,
to coincide, as closely as possible, with the implementation of the amendment to the IMO Chemical Codes. However,
compliance with the new tank barge requirements of this rule is not required until August 15, 1994.
(b) Corrections to listed electrical hazard class and group.
As indicated in the Table of Changes below, the currently listed electrical hazard class and group of various entries
in table 151.05 of 46 CFR part 151 are corrected. The entries below were identified by the Cargo Classification Working
Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) 151 Subcommittee as having erroneous electrical
hazard class-group listed in the tank barge table. The revised electrical hazard class and group listings shown below
have been verified using the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 497M, ``Manual for Classification of Gases,
Vapors and Dusts for Electrical Equipment in Hazardous (Classified) Locations,'' 1991, or the National Academy
Press's NMAB 353-5, ``Classification of Gases, Liquids and Volatile Solids Relative to Explosion-Proof Electrical
Equipment,'' 1982. These revisions merely correct errors contained in the informational electrical hazard class
and group column in the table and represent no change in requirements for the industry.
The electrical hazard class-group of the entries listed below from table 151.05, part 151 will be corrected as indicated:









This rulemaking also makes other non-substantive editorial changes and corrections, including a correction to
an error contained in the final rule entitled ``Bulk Hazardous Materials'' published April 11, 1994, in the 

Federal Register

. In revising the section heading to  153.560, the Coast Guard inadvertently revised the section number to incorrectly
read as ``  153.60'' (59 FR 17028). This error is corrected in this final rule. The correct section number is 153.560.
The Table of ``Upgrade'' Changes below lists all changes by the IMO, as ``upgrades'' to current entries in the IMO Chemical
Codes and Coast Guard regulations with a brief explanation where helpful. 
















Because the United States is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973
as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78), these amendments are required to ensure that
the Coast Guard regulations are consistent with revisions to IMO's chemical codes, which took effect July 1, 1994.
Accordingly, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to publish this rule without opportunity
for comment. On May 24, 1993, in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM (58 FR 29937), the public was notified
of the IMO revisions that are being adopted into Coast Guard regulations by this final rule.


Future rulemaking


The IMO reevaluated the Pol. Cat. and ship type of a number of entries based upon revised Hazard Profiles from the Working
Group on the Evaluation of the Hazards of Harmful Substances Carried by Ships (EHS), EHS 28 meeting held in February
1993. This action resulted in several entries in the IMO's Chemical Codes having their Pol. Cat. or carriage requirements
``downgraded'' or ``upgraded''. All ``downgrades'' have been incorporated into Coast Guard regulations by the
final rule, CGD 92-100 published April 11, 1994. The ``upgrades'' from the EHS 28 meeting will be incorporated into
Coast Guard regulations by a future rulemaking. A new Table of ``Upgrades'', as are known at this time is set out in Appendix
I to this rulemaking for the information of interested parties.


Regulatory Assessment


This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this final
rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
is unnecessary.
This rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and updates the chemical tables by adding cargoes recently authorized
by the Coast Guard or added to the IMO Chemical Codes and makes other non-substantive editorial changes and corrections.
Some costs are associated with the changes instituted by the IMO. Many U.S. flagged tank ships covered by these regulations
are already in compliance with these requirements which coincide with existing regulatory requirements.
The Coast Guard has identified costs associated with the ``upgrade'' from open or restricted gauging to closed gauging.
However, because of the marine vapor control systems regulations (final rule CGD 88-102, 55 FR 25396, June 21, 1990),
the Coast Guard has reason to believe that most U.S. tank vessels, barge or ship certificated to carry any commodity
affected by this rulemaking, will have or is having its gauging refitted to be in compliance with the vapor control
regulations. A sampling of barge operators and tank ship operators supports this position.
Because of the IMO requirements which ``upgrade'' ``motor fuel anti-knock compounds'' from the current ship type
II to ship type I, there may be an economic impact on vessels certificated to carry this material. No U.S. flagged vessels
are certificated to carry this material. World-wide there are six vessels certificated to carry this commodity,
of which four are operated by a U.S. company, the remaining two are operated by an overseas company. All six vessels
are certificated under foreign flags; four Liberian and two Norwegian. These ships currently may meet the requirements
of ship type I vessels, in which case, there will be no economic impact. However, the Coast Guard has no information
on these foreign flagged vessels to indicate whether the ships certificated to carry this material currently meet
those requirements.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore,
is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential
impact on small entities.
This final rule is largely administrative in nature. Some costs are associated with the IMO requirments implemented
by this final rule. As discussed above, most U.S. flagships that are covered by this rulemaking are in compliance with
this rule due to existing regulatory requirements.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and will merely
update current chemical tables in Coast Guard regulations and will have no Federalism implications. However, the
authority to implement the requirements of this rule has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes and
the importance of uniform requirements in the carriage of bulk hazardous cargo aboard ships moving from port to port
requires that the Coast Guard preempt conflicting State and local requirements in the same subject area.


Environment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this action is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rulemaking is an administrative update of current tables to add chemicals already approved under Coast Guard
regulation or international law. Any impact on the environment will be positive because the carriage requirements
established by the IMO could result in a reduction in maritime pollution from tankships. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.''

Appendix to this Final Rule




Note:

 The following appendix will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.




SUMMARY:

 The information contained in this appendix is for informational purposes only, and is intended to provide mariners
with insight into revisions that may be adopted in future rulelmaking actions. It does not change existing regulations.
The table below lists ``upgrades'' to current entries in the IMO Chemical Codes and Coast Guard tables and lists that,
if adopted by the IMO as anticipated, would take effect sometime in mid-1997. This table was prepared from documents
from the IMO Evaluation of Hazards Working Group (BCH), BCH 23 meeting (September 13-17, 1993). 


The IMO reevaluated the Pol. Cat. and ship type of a number of entries based upon decisions reached at the EHS 28 meeting
held in February 1993. The decisions were based on the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution
(GESAMP) Hazard Profiles from the Working Group on the Evaluation of the Hazards of Harmful Substances Carried by
Ships (EHS). The reevaluations resulted in several ``downgrades'' and ``upgrades''. All ``downgrades'' established
at that meeting have been incorporated into Coast Guard regulations by the final rule, CGD 92-100, published April
11, 1994.
These new, and any other ``upgrades'' established in the future will be included in future Coast Guard rulemaking(s)
to coincide with amendments to the IMO Chemical Codes. As stated above, at this time, the next set of amendments is scheduled
for adoption in mid-1997.
``Upgrades'' to current entries in the various tables consist of increased carriage requirements or revised, higher
Pol. Cat.'s. The Coast Guard does not consider a change in Pol. Cat. from a provisional category, designated by having
square brackets ``[ ]'' around it, to a final Pol. Cat. as an ``upgrade'' or ``downgrade''. It is considered a final
assignment and takes effect immediately upon IMO's removal of provisional status.
All ``upgrades'' as are currently known are addressed in this appendix.












1. In its continued effort to maintain consistency between the requirements of the tank ship regulations (part 153)
and the tankbarge (part 151) where applicable, the Coast Guard, in a future rulemaking, will be changing, modifying
or adding carriage requirements as discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) below.
(a) In order to conform tank ship and tankbarge requirements, special requirement 151.50-5 - ``Cargoes having toxic
properties'' will be added to the entries in table 151.01 of part 151 of the tankbarge regulations for the commodities
listed below. This is in conformance with the current special requirement for these comodities found in tank ship
regulations at   153.525, ``Special requirements for unusually toxic cargoes''. 
Acetonitrile
Acrylonitrile
Ammonium hydroxide
Butylamine
Carbon tetrachloride
Crotonaldehyde
Chloroform
Dichlorobenzene
1,1-Dichloropropane
1,2-Dichloropropane
1,3-Dichloropropane
1,3-Dichloropropene
Diisobutylamine
Diisopropylamine
N,N-Dimethylacetamide
Di-n-propylamine
Ethylamine solution (72% or less)
N-Ethylbutylamine
2-Methylpyridine
1,1,2-Trichloroethane
1,2,3-Trichloropropane
Trichloroethylene
Triethylamine
These discrepancies between the special requirements in the tank ship table and the tankbarge table were identified
by the Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee
on the Revision of Title 46 CFR part 151. These changes, to be included in a future rulemaking, would conform the requirements
for unusually toxic cargoes in table 151.05 of part 151 with the requirements in table 1 of part 153 for the same material.
(b) In addition, the entries in table 151.05, part 151 listed below were identified as having discrepancies between
the requirements for venting, or gauging, or both, as indicated by an ``X'' in the chart below when compared to the tank
ship requirements:







These discrepancies between the requirements in the tank ship table and the tankbarge table were identified by the
Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee on the
Revision of Title 46 CFR Part 151. The tankbarge requirements for venting and gauging will be reviewed by the Coast
Guard to insure that these requirements meet a minimum level of safety. The changes will be part of a future rulemaking
to conform the requirements of the two tables.
2. Coal tar.

 The Coast Guard is considering whether to initiate a future rulemaking to remove the entry ``coal tar'' from table
30.25-1 and from the list of flammable and combustible bulk liquid cargoes in parts 30-40, and then adding it to table
151.05 of part 151. The addition of this entry to table 151.05 is consistent with the inclusion of other members of the
coal tar ``family'' of commodities already in the table because of similar health safety hazards. This action would
also make the tankbarge and tank ship tables consistent with respect to this family of commodities. The Coast Guard
is coordinating this action with the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute's Task Force on Marine Shipping Regulations
for Coal Tar Products under the guidance of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC).
The entry ``coal tar'', and its family members are currently included in table 1 of part 153, and no action affecting
this table is planned.
3. 

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solutions.

 In a future rulemaking, the Coast Guard will revise the carriage requirements of the two hydrogen peroxide solution
entries in table 1 of part 153, and add requirements to table 151.05 of part 151. The revision of the tank ship requirements
in table 1 will correct omissions when these entries were first entered into the table. The addition of these entries
to the tankbarge table will permit carriage of this material b
