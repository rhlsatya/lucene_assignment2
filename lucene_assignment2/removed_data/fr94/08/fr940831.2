Forest Service

Grazing Strategies for Dinkey Creek Allotment; Kings River Ranger District, Sierra National Forest



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the development of an allotment management
plan and authorization of continued grazing on the Dinkey Allotment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The action to be evaluated by this EIS is the development of an allotment management plan and authorization for cattle
grazing on the Dinkey Creek Allotment (Sierra National Forest, Clovis, CA) that will be consistent with the standard
and guidleines in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This EIS will evaluate various grazing strategies of which one will be selected as the direction contained in the Allotment
Management Plan. A Term Grazing Permit must be issued by the Forest Service before implementation of the proposed
action. Development of the various alternatives will be in conjunction with the local community, cattle permittees,
special interest groups, State Fish and Game Department, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other interested publics.
The EIS will also address the socioeconomic effects of the different strategies on the current permittee. As required
by NEPA, the Forest will also anlayze the ``no action'' alternative as a baseline for estimating the impacts of the
various other alternatives.



The following information including tentative issues and alternatives have been identified through internal (FS)
scoping.



1. Proposed Action Statement



The Forest Service proposed to develop an Allotment Management Plan (AMP) and authorize continued grazing on the
Dinkey Creek Allotment. The AMP will guide livestock management for approximately a 10-year period.



2. Purpose and Need



The purpose and need is to develop a management plan and provide authorization for cattle grazing on the Dinkey Creek
Allotment that will be consistent with the standards and guidelines in the Sierra Forest Plan. The management plan
and permit authorization will help in achieving the goals and future conditions prescribed for the area in the Forest
Plan.



3. Issues Identified by FS Interdisciplinary Team



a. What are the effects of riparian damage and streambank destruction by livestock on water quality and the aquatic
environment, and how can those effects be addressed by alternative grazing strategies?

Localized riparian damage and destruction of streambanks by livestock may impair water quality through increased
sedimentation (embedded gravel) and higher water temperatures. This could affect aquatic insects, fish, amphibian
and reptile productivity.

b. What are the effects of livestock grazing mitigations on the economic feasibilty of the permittee's operation,
and how can those effects be addressed by alternative grazing strategies?

Costs of mitigating environmental concerns related to various resources such as water quality, aquatic habitat,
deer habitat, sensitive species habitat, riparian habitat and historic/cultural sites, etc. may cause the permittee's
operation to no longer be economically feasible.

c. What are the effects of livestock grazing on key deer habitat, and how can those effects be addressed by alternative
grazing strategies?

Deer/livestock conflicts, including inadequate amount of meadow-edge fawn hiding cover in deer summer range and
deer forage needs.

d. What are effects of livestock grazing on key willow flycatcher habitat, and how can those effects be addressed by
alternative grazing strategies?

Willow flycatcher may be impacted by livestock due to nest destruction and heavy browsing of willows.

e. What are the effects of livestock grazing on the historic, cultural and archaeological resources of the area, and
how can grazing management either protect and/or enhance those resources?

Social conflict between historical way of life of the cowboy, including preservation and maintenance of historical
facilities, and the protection of cultural sites from livestock damage such as trampling and trailing through sites.

f. What are the effects of livestock grazing on Bolander's clover and Invesia unguiculata and how can those effects
be addressed by alternative grazing strategies?

Bolander's clover may occur in the allotment and cattle grazing may impact the species. Ivesia unguiculata is present
in some meadows and may occur in other meadows with the allotment and could be impacted by livestock grazing.

g. What are the effects of livestock grazing on the recreational experience (hiking, OHV routes, campsites, etc.),
and how can those effects be addressed by alternative grazing strategies?

Localized recreation conflicts may occur on hiking trails, OHV routes, meadow-edge shade areas, and campsites due
to interaction of people and livestock (cattle excrement_cowpies, flies, ticks and aesthetics).



4. Tentative Alternatives



No action_grazing would continue at current levels.

(1) Deer and willow flycatcher protection and management_Reduce cattle grazing effects on key deer and willow flycatcher
habitat by changing season of use and number of cattle.


(2) Intensive range management_Control cattle utilization and provide additional return of organic matter to the
riparian and meadow system by using a rest rotation strategy.


(2A) Intensive range management with riparian area mitigation_Same grazing strategy as Alternative 2 except it
adjusts cattle numbers and/or season of use to protect riparian areas.



(3) Riparian and wildlife protection by short-term rest_Minimum level management strategy. A non-use period for
entire allotment.



(4) Intensive herding with emphasis on specialized monitoring training for permittees_Emphasizes a greater partnership
role and Forest Service and Permittee by having the permittee conduct monitoring of cattle utilization.



(5) Long term rest_No grazing would be allowed for five years, long term rest (5 years) of the allotment. Other uses
would continue.




Public Involvement




The public will be invited to participate in the scoping process, review of the draft environmental impact statement
and two public meetings. Initial comments are now being excepted through September 26 from those who wish to participate.
The first public meeting will be September 7, 1994, 7PM at the Clovis Memorial Building located at the corner of 5th
and Hughs Streets in Clovis, California. The second meeting will depend on the progress of the analysis and will be
announced at a latter date in the Fresno Bee newspaper.


Estimated release of the draft environmental impact statement for public comment will be on April of 1995. The comment
period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45-days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency
publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period ends, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the
final EIS. As a result, the final environmental impact statement should be ready for release in September of 1995.


The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon v. Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritage, Inc. v. Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 30 day comment period (ending on the 26th of September) so that
substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider
them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.



To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the Statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Baranof Timber Sale(s), Tongass National Forest, Chatham Area, Sitka Ranger District, Sitka, AK </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revise the July 12, 1993 notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose
the environmental impacts of proposed actions within the Northwest Baranof project area. This notice is an amendment
to the original notice of intent for this project, published July 12, 1993. The proposed action provides for: (1) Construction
of approximately 28 miles of new road, and reconstruction of approximately 7 miles of existing road in conjunction
with up to seven timber sales; (2) harvest of approximately 1,800 acres of timber, and regeneration of new stands of
trees. This level of development would result in the harvest of approximately 58 million board feet of sawlog and utility
timber volume; (3) 1,000 foot uncut timber buffers along Nakwasina Passage, St. John Baptist Bay, and the north side
of Fish Bay for the protection of wildlife and subsistence uses; (4) log transfer facilities in Nakwasina Passage
and Nakwasina Sound, St. John Baptist Bay (barge facility), Schulze Cove, and Rodman Bay; (5) no clearcut harvest
in areas which are visible from the Alaska Marine Highway route (6) no harvest in VCU 289 or 290; and (7) no harvest in
the Rodman Creek drainages and limited harvest in Fish Bay drainage. 



The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This EIS will tier to the 1979 Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) EIS, including the 1985-86 and 1990 amendments.
The TLMP provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area direction) to achieve
the desired future condition for the area in which the project is proposed. 



The Northwest Baranof Project Area is located about 10 air miles north of Sitka, Alaska, and 30 miles east of Angoon,
Alaska, on the northwestern part of Baranof Island. It encompasses ten Value Comparison Units (VCUs) including 287
through 292, 299, 301, and portions of 300 and 302 as designated in the TLMP. These VCUs are located within Management
Areas C40 and C41 as described in the TLMP. VCUs 310, 312, and 313 were dropped from the project area following initial
field review. The project area is administered by the Sitka Ranger District of the Chatham Area, Tongass National
Forest in Sitka, Alaska. 

The purpose and need for the Northwest Baranof project is to make 30-100 million board feet of timber available
through up to seven independent timber sales or offerings to the Ketchikan Pulp Company under the conditions of its
long-term timber sale contract. This timber is needed to provide a sustained level of wood products to meet local,
national, and international demand; and to provide local employment in the wood products industry. A comparison
of the desired future condition for the project area (as identified in the TLMP) with the existing condition shows
the need to convert suitable stands of old-growth timber to managed productive stands capable of long-term timber
production. 

Gary A. Morrison, Forest Supervisor, Chatham Area, is the Responsible Official and will decide whether or not to authorize
timber harvest within the Northwest Baranof Project Area. He will decide (1) If the design of the timber sale offerings
are consistent with meeting resource protection standards and guidelines in the TLMP; (2) how much timber volume
to make available; (3) the location and design of the arterial and collector road system needed to develop the project
area; (4) the location and design of timber harvest units and log transfer facilities; (5) mitigation and monitoring
measures for sound resource management; and (6) whether there may be a significant restriction on subsistence uses,
and if so, other determinations required by section 810 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.

Issues are expected to revolve around: (1) Management of wildlife and fish habitat; (2) subsistence needs; (3) location,
design and impacts of log transfer facilities; (4) recreation and visual impacts; and (5) the economic health of Southeast
Alaska.

To proceed with the timber harvest as proposed, various permits must be obtained from other agencies. The agencies
and their responsibilities are as follows: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for approval of discharge
of dredged or fill materials into the waters of the United States (Section 404 of the Clean Water Act), and approval
of construction of structures or work in navigable waters of the United States (Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act of 1899); EPA has responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System review (Section 402
of the Clean Water Act). Other agencies which will participate are as follows: State of Alaska, Department of Natural
Resources has responsibility for authorization for occupancy and use of tidelands and submerged lands; State of
Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation has responsibility for the Solid Waste Disposal Permit (Section
402 of Clean Water Act) and the Certificate of Reasonable Assurance (Section 404 of Clean Water Act); U.S. Coast Guard
has responsibility for Coast Guard Bridge Permits (in accordance with the General Bridge Act of 1946) required for
all structures constructed within the tidal influence zone. Both the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will
participate as cooperating agencies in preparation of the EIS.

Preparation of the EIS began with public notification and scoping in June, 1993. EIS preparation will continue with
the following additional steps: (1) Public notification and scoping (approximately 45 days beginning on the date
of publication of this Notice in the Federal Register); (2) identification of issues related to the proposed action
(significant issues) and a discussion of reasons for not considering other issues (non-significant issues) in this
analysis; (3) identification of issues to be analyzed in depth; (4) development of reasonable alternatives to the
proposed action which meet the stated purpose and need for the proposed action and address significant issues; and
(5) identification of the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.

For step 1, scoping announcements will be published in the Sitka Daily Sentinel newspaper on or about August 26 and
September 14, 1994, and copies of the announcement will be mailed to interested persons. This announcement will describe
the timing and location of the proposed project and will request comments. It will also contain specific information
about the location and timing of public involvement meetings. Scoping meetings will be held in Sitka, Alaska on September
21 and October 6, 1994, in the Maksoutoff Room of the Centennial Building from 6:30 p.m. until 9:00 p.m., and Angoon,
Alaska September 28 through 30, 1994. Exact locations and times of the Angoon scoping meetings will be announced in
local newspapers and on radio station public service announcements.

For steps 2 and 3, the Interdisciplinary Team will review comments received during both scoping periods to determine
issues which are significant and within the scope of this project.

Step 4 will consider a range of alternatives developed to address significant issues. One of these will be the ``No
Action'' alternative, in which there is no harvest or road building activity. Other alternatives may consider various
levels and locations of harvest and regeneration in response to issues and non-timber objectives.

Step 5 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects
of each alternative will be analyzed and documented. In addition, site specific mitigation measures for each alternative
will be identified and their effectiveness evaluated.

In addition to commenting on the proposed action and the Draft EIS when it is released, agencies and other interested
persons or groups are invited to contact Forest Service officials at any time during the planning process.

The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the EPA during the summer of 1995. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be
45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions; 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).

 Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion
of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts; 

City of Angoon v. Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the Draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these
points.

The Final EIS and Record of Decision is expected to be released in the winter of 1995-96. The Forest Supervisor
for the Chatham Area of the Tongass National Forest will, as the responsible official for the EIS, make a decision regarding
this proposal considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the Final EIS,
and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and supporting reasons will be documented in the Record
of Decision.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to provide
timber for the Ketchikan Pulp Company 50-year Timber Sale Contract or the Ketchikan Area Independent Timber Sale
Program. The Record of Decision will disclose how the Forest Service has decided to provide harvest units, roads,
and associated timber harvesting facilities. The proposed action is to harvest an estimated 70 million board feet
(mmbf) of timber on an estimated 2,200 acres. A range of alternatives will be developed to achieve this estimated volume
and include a no-action alternative. The proposed timber harvest is located within Tongass Forest Plan Management
Area K32, VCU's 737, 744, and 746, on Revillagigedo (Revilla) Island, Alaska, on the Ketchikan Ranger District of
the Ketchikan Area of the Tongass National Forest.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
(1) Public Participation


Public participation will be an integral component of the study process and will be especially important at several
points during the analysis. The first is during the scoping process. The Forest Service will be seeking information,
comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and individuals and organizations that may be interested
in, or affected by, the proposed activities. The scoping process will include (1) Identification of potential issues;
(2) identification of issues to be analyzed in depth; and, (3) eliminating of insignificant issues or these which
have been covered by a previous environmental review. Public scoping meetings are scheduled in Alaska at Ketchikan,
October 4, 1994, and Saxman, October 5, 1994. Written scoping comments are being solicited through a scoping package
that will be sent to the project mailing list. For the Forest Service to best use the scoping input, comments should
be received by October 28, 1994.
Tentative issues identified for analysis in the EIS include the potential effects of the project on and the relationship
of the project to: subsistence resources, old-growth ecosystem management and the maintenance of habitat for viable
populations of wildlife and plant species, timber sale economics, timber supply, visual and recreational resources,
anadromous fish habitat, potential road connections on Revilla Island, the Neets Bay Fish Hatchery, soil and water
resources, cultural resources, Misty Fiords National Monument wilderness values, and others. 
Based on results of scoping and the resources capabilities within the project area, alternatives including a ``no
action'' alternative will be developed for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS). The Draft EIS is
projected to be filed in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August 1995. Public comment on the Draft EIS
will be solicited for a minimum of 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of
availability in the Federal Register. Subsistence hearing, as provided for in Section 8 of the Alaska National Interest
Lands Conservation Acg (ANICLA), are planned during this 45-day comment period. The Final EIS is anticipated by April
1996.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
during scoping and comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the
merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on
Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Act
at 40 CFR 1503.8 in addressing these points. 
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of Draft EIS statements must structure their
participation in the environmental review of the proposal os that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's
position and concerns. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC,

AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA. 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action is to designate 41 helicopter landing areas in wilderness on the Tongass National Forest. Presently,
the use of helicopters by the general public for access to wilderness is prohibited on the Tongass National Forest
by regulation (36 CFR 261.10). The designation of helicopter landing areas is based on uses which were established
at the time of the designation of the wilderness which is allowed by the Wilderness Act (Pub. L. 88-577) under
36 CFR 293.6(d). The 41 landing areas identified in the Forest Service proposed action are located in seven of the 19
designated wildernesses on the Tongass National Forest. The wildernesses where landing areas are proposed and the
number of landing areas proposed are Endicott River (1), Kootznoowoo (Admiralty Island National Monument) (6),
Misty Fiords National Monument (25), South Etolin (1), South Prince of Wales (1), Strikine-LeConte (4), and Tracy
Arm-Fords Terror (3). The proposed action would allow up to 50 helicopter landings per year on some landing areas.
Implementation of the proposed action likely would require special use permits for helicopter landings to address
management concerns including monitoring. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of the project is to provide continued general public helicopter access for ``traditional'' activities
while managing Tongass National Forest wilderness to provide high quality wilderness opportunities. In this context,
traditional activities include hiking, camping, photography, fishing, and other wilderness-oriented forms of
recreation. Access for activities authorized under legal authorities other than Section 4(d)(1) of the Wilderness
Act (such as outfitting/guiding, mineral exploration, maintaining communication sites, agency administrative
use) is 

not 

included in this project. 
 
 


The Regional Forester, Phil Janik, must decide whether to allow continued helicopter landings for access by the general
public in areas that were used prior to wilderness designation. If helicopter landing areas are approved, the Regional
Forester will decide which areas will be designated and what restrictions, if any, will be established. 
 
A scoping letter was sent in 1992 to persons on a Tongass National Forest mailing list. Requests for comments were published
in newspapers throughout southeast Alaska. Public meetings were held in Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka,
and Wrangell, Alaska the fall of 1992. Additional comments will be solicited through mailings, public notices, and
this 

Federal Register

 Notice. Additional public scoping meetings are not planned. 
 
Alternatives will include the proposed action, a no action alternative, and other action alternatives. All action
alternatives would authorize some helicopter landings in wilderness for general public access. Proposed land areas
may or may not include areas already accessed by other motorized methods as provided for in Section 1110(a) of the Alaska
National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), Public Law 96-487. The following preliminary issues have
been identified:

1. Access for traditional activities. Should continued helicopter landings be authorized to provide general public
access to wilderness for traditional activities?
2. Wilderness. What effects will designation of helicopter landing areas have on the wilderness resource and the
inherent qualities of wilderness such as remoteness, isolation, and sense of privacy?
3. Heritage Resources. What effects will the increase of general public access have on known cultural resources and
yet undiscovered cultural resources?
4. Wildlife. What effects will helicopter landings have on wildlife, especially threatened, endangered and sensitive
species including mountain goats, goshawks, bald eagles, and brown bears?
5. Recreation. What changes in recreational use patterns may occur because of the reintroduction of helicopter landings
into wilderness?
6. Subsistence. What effects will helicopter landings have on subsistence resources and uses within wilderness?
The draft environmental impact statement is projected to be issued in May, 1995. The comment period on the draft environmental
impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the notice of availability
in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process.
First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental
review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by
the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service
at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
Issuance of the final environmental impact statement is projected in December, 1995. The responsible official for
the decision is Phil Janik, Regional Forester, Alaska Region, P.O. Box 21628, Juneau, AK 99802-1628.

Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) For Continued Military Training Use of National Forest Lands At Camp
Shelby, MS



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FEIS addresses environmental considerations of alternatives for the continued military training and land use
within the part of the DeSoto National Forest that lies within the boundaries of Camp Shelby. The proposed action does
not involve an expansion of the site nor acquisition of additional land. Environmental impacts addressed in the FEIS
include possible effects on endangered species, biodiversity, soil loss, wetlands, forest and recreational opportunities.
The FEIS includes discussions of six land use alternatives, focusing on the direct and indirect environmental impacts
of each.



Concurrently with release of the FEIS, the Forest Service has released a Record of Decision (ROD) detailing which
areas and types of activities are authorized for military training purposes on 117,000 acres of National Forest lands
within the current Special Use Permit boundaries at Camp Shelby. The Forest Service ROD authorizes the reconfiguration
of existing training areas to permit simultaneous tracked vehicle maneuver training and range gunnery practice
within Camp Shelby's current acreage, while excluding tracked vehicle maneuver within the Leaf River Wildlife Management
Area.

The regulations of the U.S. Forest Service allow for a 45-day appeal of the decision. Under Department of the Army regulations,
once the FEIS is published there is a minimum 30-day waiting period prior to release of its ROD.

As the Forest Service ROD indicates, a compromise decision is being considered allowing the agencies to balance environmental
impacts while achieving many of the Army's training needs.

The Army and Forest Service have been involved in discussions throughout the Environmental Impact Statement process.
Regulations allow the decisionmakers to select one alternative or to combine components of several different alternatives.
All elements of the decision reached must be within the range of environmental impacts discussed in the FEIS.

The Army's Preferred Alternative for this FEIS is Alternative 1. With this alternative, the Army proposes to continue
military training, and develop training areas suitable for battalion task force maneuvers in accordance with current
Army doctrine. This alternative fully meets Camp Shelby's tracked vehicle training requirements. Full implementation
of this alternative will be limited by, or subject to, the Forest Service Special Use Permit requirements

The Department of the Army will issue its ROD in no less than 30 days using the FEIS to verify its decision, and will subsequently
commit manpower and resources to support operations and training activities at Camp Shelby. The Army will work toward
the development of a ROD that will conform to the framework of the Forest Service ROD.

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Intent is for the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for proposed Army and
Air National Guard projects at the Massachusetts Military Reservation. The proposal includes renovation and rehabilitation
of existing facilities, range improvements, demolition and construction of facilities, and development of ranges.



Lead Agencies are: The Massachusetts Military Division and the National Guard Bureau.

Various alternatives have been developed for consideration regarding the proposed projects at the Massachusetts
Military Reservation. The following constitutes a list of those alternatives to be considered in the DEIS:

(1) No action; 

(2) Relocation of actions on-site and

(3) Alternative locations off-site.

Resource categories that will be analyzed include: physical environment, water quality, groundwater, air quality,
biological resources, land use, socioeconomic, noise, and cultural resources.




SCOPING: 

 The Massachusetts Military Division will conduct a public scoping meeting relating to the proposed actions. Public
participation in the DEIS process is essential to assist the decision maker in defining the scope of analysis considered
in the DEIS. 



Interested individuals, governmental agencies, and private organizations are invited to submit information and
comments on this proposed action for consideration by the National Guard Bureau. Information that would assist the
National Guard Bureau in analyzing the potential significant environmental consequences are solicited. This includes
information on other environmental studies planned or completed in the area of the Massachusetts Military Reservation;
other alternatives; potential impacts associated with the proposed action; and recommended mitigation measures.

Concerned individuals and agencies may express their views either by writing to the designated point of contact or
participating in a public scoping meeting to be held at a convenient location near the Massachusetts Military Reservation.
The date, time and location for the meeting will be announced through letters, public notices, display advertisements
and released to newspaper of general circulation a minimum of 15 days prior to the meeting. Those wishing to provide
information or data relevant to the environmental analysis of the proposed actions or alternatives are encouraged
to do so at the public scoping meetings.

Upon completion, the DEIS will be available to the public. The availability of this document will be announced by means
of public notices so that all interested parties may review and comment on the document. A public hearing to solicit
public response to the analysis will also be scheduled.

out responsibilities under the Indian Education Act of 1988 (Part C, Title V, Pub. L. 100-297) and to advise Congress
and the Secretary of Education with regard to federal education programs in which Indian children or adults participate
or from which they can benefit and submit a list on nominees for the position of Director, Office of Indian Education.


The Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Indian Education has called for a meeting of the full Council from
September 20-23, 1994. On Tuesday, September 20, and Wednesday, September 21, the agenda consists of an orientation
session for newly appointed members that will include: ethics training; swearing-in ceremony; discussion of current
Indian education issues; and meeting with officials from the Department of Education and with representatives of
Indian organizations.
The closed portion of the meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 21, from 1:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. and will be devoted
to interviewing candidates for the position of Director, Office of Indian Education. Subsequently, the Council
will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Education for filling such vacancy. Interviews with the candidates
and discussions held in conjunction with the selection process will involve matters which relate solely to the internal
personnel rules and practices of the Council and are likely to disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such matters are
protected by exemptions (2) and (6) of section 552b(c) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409;
5 U.S.C. 552b(c)).
The remainder of the meeting schedule on Thursday, September 22, and Friday, September 23, is open and will be a continuation
of orientation activities. Included also will be an opportunity for public participation in Council discussions.
Interested individuals may contact the NACIE office for a final agenda the week prior to the meeting date.
Records shall be kept of all Council proceedings and are available for public inspection at the office of the National
Advisory Council on Indian Education located at 330 C Street S.W., Room 4072, Washington, DC 20202-7556 from
the hours of 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

<DOCTITLE>Floodplain Statement of Findings for the Replacement of Four Bridges </DOCTITLE>
on the Savannah River Site 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Floodplain Statement of Findings. 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Floodplain Statement of Findings is prepared in compliance with 10 CFR Part 1022. It is designed to evaluate the
impact to the floodplain of the Savannah River Site (SRS) resulting from work that is needed to replace selected bridges
on SRS Roads 8-1 and 2-1. The scope of this project is intended to immediately replace three bridges because
of deteriorated, decayed, or rotten timber piles. A fourth bridge would be scheduled for a later replacement. The
proposed work would involve working in and close to the 100-year floodplain of Upper Three Runs and Tinker Creek. The
creeks associated with these projects have average annual flows which are greater than 5 cubic feet per second and
a Federal permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is not expected to be required for the proposed work.
These impacted areas would include: 




 Replacement of Bridge 603-13G at the intersection of the stream Upper Three Runs Creek and SRS Road 8-1.

 Replacement of Bridge 603-14G at the intersection of the stream Tinker Creek and SRS Road 8-1. 
 Replacement of Bridge 603-15G at the intersection of the stream Upper Three Runs Creek and SRS Road 2-1.

 Replacement of Bridge 603-39G at the intersection of the stream Tinker Creek and SRS Road 2-1. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The bridges on SRS Road 8-1 (603-13G and 603-14G) which cross Upper Three Runs Creek and Tinker Creek
will be replaced and raised with minimal short-term impact and no long-term impact to floodplains. A storm water and
sediment control plan will be required prior to bridge replacement in order to minimize sediments eroding into the
adjacent floodplain. 



The work required to replace these two bridges would be accomplished from the existing road beds using a crane for pile
driving, erection, and demolition. This activity should not have any significant impact on the floodplain. The only
disturbance to the stream is anticipated to be the installation of pilings to support the center span of the bridge.
Prestressed, precast concrete beams shall be used to minimize pile installation in the stream by constructing longer
spans. A small amount of sediment would be expected to go into the stream where the work is close to the channel and temporarily
increase stream's sediment load level. These increased sediment loads would be less than that encountered after
a heavy rain storm. The old bridge supports would be cut off at the stream bed. The bridges are to be replaced in kind at
their present locations so that there should be no loss or long term impact to floodplains. 

The bridge (603-15G) that spans Upper Three Runs Creek on SRS Road 2-1 would be replaced with minimal short-term
impact and no long-term impact to wetlands or floodplains. The bridge (603-39G) that spans Tinker Creek on SRS
Road 2-1 would be scheduled for replacement in the future as funding became available. 

The conditions of the bridges covered in this Statement of Findings do not meet Department of Energy, American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials, South Carolina Department of Transportation, or Federal Highway
Administration standards and guidelines and therefore severely limits the type of traffic that may utilize these
bridges on the primary route to the Advanced Tactical Training Area. Fire control equipment and logging trucks use
this route so that any delay in replacing these bridges would greatly limit the traffic count and load limits permitted
along this route, and would constitute a safety hazard to SRS personnel. Repair was considered as a potential alternative
but with the present condition of the bridges, the most cost effective method is replacement. The environmental impact
of repairing these bridges was also evaluated and found to be nearly identical in scope to that of replacing the bridges.
Bridge rehabilitation strategies were evaluated and concluded replacement of the bridges over rehabilitation
for many reasons, but largely because replacement of deteriorated piles and backwalls would fail to improve the load
carrying capacity of the bridges for vehicles crossing the structure. Timber pile and backwall replacement will
cause the same environmental impacts if not, more, because the bridge deck and piling caps must be completely removed
in order to drive new piles and construct concrete abutments at the edge of the stream in order to maintain existing
span lengths. Replacement of the entire bridge structure allows the span to be lengthened sufficiently to permit
construction of bridge abutments well away from the stream bed, thereby reducing impacts, and reducing construction
costs. 

Several mitigation activities will be implemented to minimize potential impacts to the floodplain. Silt fences
and other erosion control structures as needed will be installed to ensure there is no deposition in downslope areas.
Long-term construction impacts in the floodplain and wetland areas will be minimized through the removal of any excess
excavated sidefill and restoration to the original contours following completion of construction. An erosion control
plan will be developed so that the proposed action complies with applicable State and local floodplain protection
standards and further, to ensure that no additional impacts will occur due to erosion and sedimentation. Best management
practices will be employed during construction and maintenance activities associated with this proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award: Open Hands </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial
assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the Open Hands, under Grant Number
DE-FG01-94CE16095 to initiate a demonstration project for new technology for innovative exterior insulation
on houses. The Department of Energy has determined that a noncompetitive award is being conducted by the applicant
using their own resources or those donated or provided by third parties, however, DOE support of that activity would
enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct
such activity. 

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(i)(D) that the application submitted
by the Open Hands is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed
project represents a unique technology which has a possibility of DOE promoting implementation of components of
the National Energy Policy Act Sections 142 to develop and adopt new weatherization technologies through coordinated
effort of Federal State and Local organizations. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount
of $25,000 over a one year period. Data obtained from the grantee will enhance the public benefit to be derived from
the project by increasing the amount of data being collected on the proof of concept demonstration for the potential
new technology for innovative installing exterior insulation system. The Department of Energy has determined it
to be in the public interest to award a noncompetitive grant to the Open Hands (Non-Profit Organization) because the
proposed project has been initiated by the applicant using his own resources. The grantee will provide the labor,
materials and equipment to test the feasibility of the demonstrated proof of concept for technology for installing
exterior insultation for houses as directed. The proposed project is authorized under the Energy Conservation in
Existing Buildings Act of 1976 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6851 et seq., PL 94-375, and 10 CFR 440 and will allow the DOE
to evaluate other types of Weatherization in the future as this is proved.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award; Intent to Award Grant to the State of Utah</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announces, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7, that it intends to
award a grant based on a noncompetitive determination to the State of Utah to support the activities of the Region VIII
Weatherization Managers Association in the amount of $325,000. The State of Utah is the sponsor of the Weatherization
Managers Association which is an organization comprised of representatives from each of the six states in the region:
Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed financial assistance to the State of Utah for the Weatherization Managers Association will assist the
six states' Weatherization Assistance Programs by supporting and stimulating technical development activities
which improve the depth of knowledge and the caliber of technical skills of the regional Weatherization grantees
and subgrantees. The project's objectives are to facilitate technical assistance activities identified by the
Weatherization Managers Association which benefit all of the state programs in the region.


The proposed project meets the criteria of 10 CFR Part 600.7 (b)(2)(i) (B) and (D) in that the activity would be conducted
by the Weatherization Managers Association using their own resources. However, DOE support of the activity will
enhance the public benefits to be derived by increasing the amount and quality of training to be presented. The Denver
Support Office knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct any of these activities.
The Weatherization Managers Association sponsored by the State of Utah is the only region-specific organization
of which every Weatherization program is a member and, therefore, possesses exclusive capability to perform the
activities successfully.




Project Period



The initial term of the award will be for twelve (12) months, for a possible project period of three years from the initial
date of award. Possible additional funding in future years will be based on satisfactory completion of the initial
term and availability of funding.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of the proposed revision of forms EIA-846A/C, ``Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey,'' and solicitation
of comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
Pub. L. No. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), conducts a presurvey consultation program to provide the general
public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms.
This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized,
reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly
assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed revision to forms EIA-846A/C, ``Manufacturing
Energy Consumption Survey.''



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background.
II. Current Actions.
III. Request for Comments 


I. Background 


In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. No. 93-275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91), the Energy Information Administration is
obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program,
EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource
reserves, production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the
adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social
needs. 
The Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) has been conducted three times previously, covering the years
1985, 1988, and 1991. The MECS has collected basic data on energy consumption, fuel-switching, and in 1991, end-uses,
energy management activities, and energy-saving technologies. The MECS forms the basis for major publications
on energy consumption and energy intensity (e.g., Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey: Consumption of Energy,
1988 and Changes in Energy Intensity in the Manufacturing Sector, 1980-1988.) 
The proposed 1994 MECS design utilizes experience gained from the administration and processing of the three previous
surveys and consultations with respondents, trade association representatives, and data users. EIA conducted
user needs assessment meetings with frequent customers of the MECS data both inside and outside the Department of
Energy. When meetings were not feasible, outside customers especially were given a chance to present their requests
through mail or phone conversation. This notice can serve as another chance for customers to express their manufacturing
energy data needs. 
Additionally, a formal survey of 1991 MECS respondents about their experiences in completing that questionnaire
was done during the conduct of the MECS to determine other enhancements and redesign directions for the 1994 survey.



II. Current Actions 


EIA proposes to make the changes described below to the 1991 MECS survey forms for use in 1994. These changes are being
made to better serve the needs of data users, streamline the administration and processing of the survey, and reduce
respondent burden where possible. The frequency of the MECS is also changing. In accordance with Section 171 of the
Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the MECS, beginning in 1994, will be conducted biennially. 
The sample size for the 1994 MECS has been increased to 
 Permit more extensive coverage of industries consuming wood and biomass (approximately 5 additional four-digit
Standard Industrial Classification codes)

 Better serve the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) by providing inputs at a finer geographic level (Census
Division) for two-digit and selected four-digit Standard Industrial Classification codes 
 Enable the MECS to publish reliable population counts of manufacturing characteristics collected on the
MECS forms 
 Improve the reliability of estimates. 
As in previous versions, the 1994 MECS will contain five sections: Section I, Non-Combustible Energy Sources; Section
II, Combustible Energy Sources; Section III, Fuel Switching Capability; Section IV, Estimated Percent Consumption
by End Use; and Section V, Establishment Checklist. In addition, the 1994 MECS will collect minimal information to
determine the operational status of the manufacturing establishment for purposes of statistical sampling. 
As in the 1991 survey, separate forms will be used to meet the special needs of three major groups of manufacturers.
EIA-846A will be sent to the majority of the manufacturing establishments; EIA-846B will be sent to establishments
in SIC 2911 (Petroleum Refining); and EIA-846C will be sent to all other establishments in SIC 29 (Petroleum
Refining and Related Industries), as well as establishments in SIC 24 (Lumber and Wood Products), SIC 26 (Paper and
Allied Products), SIC 28 (Chemicals and Allied 
Products), and SIC 3312 (Blast Furnaces and Steel Mills). EIA-846A is the most general form and collects the
basic consumption and fuel-switching data. EIA-846B minimizes burden for the refining industry by taking
advantage of data already collected by other EIA surveys. Finally, EIA-846C is very similar to EIA-846A
except that it collects additional information on energy source shipments. 
Specific changes in data items from the 1991 MECS are discussed section by section below. 
Section I (Noncombustible Energy Sources): This section will not differ among the three forms. The noncombustible
energy sources (electricity, steam, and industrial hot water) will remain as the column headings with desired quantities
forming the rows of the table. One question, a checkbox for the source of renewable electricity generation, will be
added for 1994. 
Proposed to be dropped from the 1994 MECS Section I is the requirement that establishments that received transfers
of noncombustible energy sources from outside establishments indicate the name, address and telephone number of
the supplier. This will result in the removal from the MECS of Form EIA-846D, a questionnaire that was sent in
1988 and 1991 to company-owned electric generating plants serving manufacturers. The institution and further development
of Form EIA-867, ``Annual Nonutility Power Producer Report'' made the EIA-846D redundant. 
Section II (Combustible Energy Sources): In 1994, the MECS will contain revised wood- and biomass-related energy
source categories to agree with respondent and data-user understanding of these energy sources. Specifically,

 The category ``Roundwood'' will be expanded to explicitly include any wood product (roundwood, wood chips,
and bark) generated from harvested trees. 
 Wood Waste will be termed Wood Residue and it will include byproducts from mill processing (bark, slabs, sawdust,
shavings). 
 ``Waste Materials'' will be more specifically defined as wood/paper related refuse. 
Natural gas is another energy source that will be modified in 1994 to reflect the deregulation of the natural gas industry
and emerging purchasing patterns of manufacturers. The MECS will collect natural gas purchases and cost data within
the major categories: 
 Local Distribution Company/Utilities (LDC) 
 Other Sources (Pipelines, Brokers, and Other). 
For LDC purchases of natural gas, the 1994 MECS will collect purchases and expenditures for three natural gas service
rates: Firm, Interruptible, or Other. For other sources, the quantity of purchases will be collected but not subdivided.
However, costs will be collected for three components of the Other Sources purchases total: cost of supplies, cost
of transportation, and unspecified costs. 
Section III (Fuel Switching): Previously, fuel switching data were restricted to fuel switching capability, rather
than actual fuel switching experiences. This section will continue to collect information on the capabilities of
a manufacturing establishment, however, it will be enhanced with questions pertaining to actual fuel substitution.
These questions for each fuel are: 
 Number of times substitutions occurred 
 Primary reason(s) for substitution, such as: supply shortage or curtailment of this fuel, down-time caused
by maintenance, less expensive substitute, environmental restriction on emissions or waste 
 If ``less expensive substitute'' was chosen as a primary reason, the respondent is asked to supply a range that
contains the difference between the alternative fuel price and the current fuel price as percentage of the current
price.

<TEXT>
 

Section IV (Estimated Percent Consumption by End Use): No substantial changes from the 1991 version are anticipated.
Definitions and instructions will be enhanced to clarify possible ambiguities among the categories. 
Section V (Establishment Checklist): There are three subsections in Section V: Part A. Estimated Square Footage
of Buildings, Part B. Energy Management Activities, Part C. General Technologies, and other parts concerning specific
technologies relevant only to selected industries. 
EIA and the Bureau of the Census jointly conducted a survey of MECS respondents for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness
and comprehensibility of certain aspects of the 1991 MECS questionnaire. The results of the survey relating to Part
A indicate that most respondents could provide an estimate of the enclosed square-footage without major difficulty.
Accordingly, the 1994 MECS questionnaire will ask for those estimates. Those respondents who would still prefer
to give an estimate within a broad category will be given that option. 
The list for Part B will be expanded to include participation in certain Federal government programs, such as the Environmental
Protection Agency's ``Green Lights'' and DOE's ``Motor Challenge.'' Third party sponsorship will be separated
from Self-only participation as a column-header. 
Part C, the checklist for energy-saving technologies, will be expanded to include specific cogeneration technologies.

<DOCTITLE>Consolidated Hydro Maine, Inc.; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping
Meetings</DOCTITLE>


August 25, 1994.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of the South Berwick Dam
Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 11163. The project is located on the Salmon Falls River in Stafford County, New Hampshire
and York County, Maine.
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.
The staff's EA will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.
A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be
presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.


Scoping Meetings


The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while a
morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies
are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed
in the EA. Staff will visit the project site prior to the meetings to become more familiar with the project and its operation.
Both scoping meetings will be held on Thursday, September 29, 1994, in the South Berwick Assembly Hall, 180 Main Street,
South Berwick, Maine. The first meeting will be held from 10:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. and will focus primarily on issues
of concern to resource agencies. The second meeting will be held from 7:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. and will focus primarily
on issues of concern to the general public.
Prior to the meetings, a scoping document will be mailed to the list of interested parties. The scoping document identifies
resource issues to be addressed in the EA. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings
or can be obtained by writing: FERC_South Berwick Project, c/o J.H. Rumpp, Stone & Webster, 245 Summer Street,
Boston, MA 022010.


Objectives


At the scoping meetings the staff will: (1) summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the EA; (2) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EA' (3) identify resource issues
that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views.


Procedures


The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal
record of the Commission proceedings. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly
identify themselves for the record.
Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.
Participants at the public meetings are asked to keep oral comments brieff and concise.
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed
with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until
October 31, 1994.
All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: South Berwick EA, Project
No. 11163.
All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the licensing proceeding are asked to refrain
from engaging staff or its contractor in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings.
Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents
with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list.
For further information, please contact Susan Strandberg (202) 219-2829.

<DOCTITLE>Indiana Michigan Power Co.; Public Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>


August 25, 1994.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) has received applications for new license (relicense) for
the following two existing hydropower projects operated by the Indiana Michigan Power Company on the mainstem St.
Joseph River: (1) the Buchanan Project (FERC No. 2551) located in Berrien County, Michigan; and (2) the Twin Branch
Project (FERC No. 2579) located in St. Joseph County, Indiana.
Upon review of the applications, supplemental filings, and intervenor submittals, the Commission staff has concluded
that, given the locations and existing status of the projects, staff will prepare one Environmental Assessment (EA)
that describes and evaluates the probable impacts of the applicant's proposed and alternative operating strategies,
environmental enhancement measures, and improve public recreational access and facilities for both projects.
One element of the EA process is scoping. Scoping activities are initiated early to:
 Identify reasonable alternative operational procedures and environmental enhancement measures that should
be evaluated in the EA;

 Identify significant environmental and public recreational access issues related to the operation of the
projects;
 Determine the depth of analysis for issues that will be discussed in the EA; and
 Identify resource issues that are of lessor importance and, consequently, do not require detailed analysis
in the EA.


Scoping Meetings


Staff will hold two meetings. An evening scoping meeting is designed primarily for receiving public input, whereas
an agency meeting will focus on federal, state, and local government concerns. We invite all interested agencies,
tribes, organizations, and individuals to attend either or both meetings and to assist staff in identifying the scope
of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA.
The evening meeting for the general public will be held from 6:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20, 1994, at
the Bittersweet Branch of the Mishawaka_Penn Public Library, located at 602 Bittersweet Road in Mishawaka, Indiana.
The agency-oriented meeting will be held from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, September 21, 1994, in the Commission
Chamber of Buchanan City Hall, located at 302 N. Redbud Trail in Buchanan, Michigan.


Procedures


Both meetings, which will be recorded by a stenographer, will become part of the formal record of the Commission's
proceeding on the Buchanan and Twin Branch Projects. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked
to sign in before the meetings start and identify themselves for the record.
Concerned parties are encouraged to offer us verbal guidance during the public meetings. Speaking time allowed for
individuals at the evening public meeting will be determined before that meeting, based on the number of persons wishing
to speak and the approximate amount of time available for the session, but all speakers will be provided at least five
minutes to present their views.


Scoping Meeting Objectives


At the scoping meetings, the staff will:
 Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the multiple-project EA;
 Identify resource issues that are of lessor importance and, therefore, do not require detailed analysis;
 Solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable data, concerning
significant local resources; and
 Encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA.


Information Requested


Federal and state resource agencies, local government officials, interested groups, area residents, and concerned
individuals are requested to provide any information they believe will assist the Commission staff to analyze the
environmental impacts associated with relicensing the Buchanan and Twin Branch Projects. The types of information
sought include the following:
 Data, reports, and resource plans that characterize existing (baseline) physical, biological, or social
environments in the vicinity of the projects;
 Information and data that helps staff identify or evaluate significant environmental and recreational issues;
and
 Information from any EA, environmental impact statement or study (completed, in progress, or planned) relevant
to the Buchanan and Twin Branch relicensing.
Scoping information and associated comments should be submitted to the Commission no later than September 30, 1994.
Written comments should be provided at the scoping meetings or mailed to the Commission at the following address:
Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.
All correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page of each submittal:



Buchanan Project, FERC No. 2552
Twin Branch Project, FERC No. 2579



Intervenors are reminded of the Commission's Rule of Practice and Procedure requiring them to serve a copy of all documents
filed with the Commission on each person whose name is listed on the service listed for the Buchanan and Twin Branch
Projects.
For further information, please contact Jim Haimes of the Commission's Division of Project Review in Washington,

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice announces the availability of and requests public comment on Draft Site Treatment Plans for treating
the Department of Energy's (DOE) mixed radioactive and hazardous waste. As an interim step toward meeting the requirements
of the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 (FFCAct or the Act), DOE has prepared a Draft Site Treatment Plan (Draft
Plan) for each of 48 sites located in 22 states where DOE is currently storing, generating, or is expected to generate
mixed hazardous and radioactive waste within the next five years. These Draft Plans contain the sites' preferred
treatment options for this waste, where available. The Draft Plans are being provided at each site for public review
and comment as well as for review and discussion among the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulators.
Comments on the Draft Plans will be considered in developing Proposed Site Treatment Plans to be submitted to the regulators
for approval in February 1995.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The DOE is required by section 3021(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the FFCAct,
to prepare Site Treatment Plans (Plans) describing the development of treatment capacities and technologies for
treating mixed waste for each site at which DOE stores or generates mixed waste. Mixed waste is defined by the Act as
waste containing both a hazardous waste subject to RCRA, and source, special nuclear or by-product material subject
to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The Site Treatment Plans will be submitted to the regulating State or the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) for approval, approval with modification, or disapproval. The Draft Plans are the intermediate
version of the Site Treatment Plans and are being provided to the States and EPA, and made available to the public, for
review and comment. DOE is preparing Site Treatment Plans for the following sites:

As outlined in an April 6, 1993, Federal Register

 notice (58 FR 17875), DOE is developing the Site Treatment Plans in three stages. The first stage, the Conceptual Site
Treatment Plans, were released in October 1993 and described a wide range of possible treatment alternatives for
each mixed waste stream. The Draft Site Treatment Plans were issued in August 1994, and include one or two options identified
at the site, with input from the State, as the preferred treatment for each mixed waste stream. After further analysis
of the preferred options for the DOE complex as a whole, discussions among the States, and consideration of public
comments, DOE will submit Proposed Site Treatment Plans in February 1995 to the appropriate regulatory agency (i.e.,
the State or EPA). The regulatory agency will issue an Order requiring compliance with the approved Plan. Sites that
are in compliance with approved Plans and Orders after October 1995 will be exempt from fines and penalties related
to the storage prohibitions [section 3004(j)] under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). 


II. Draft Site Treatment Plans 


In response to early discussions with the States, DOE followed a ``bottom-up'' approach in which the DOE Operations
Offices evaluated treatment options for the mixed waste at each site, in conjunction with the host State and others.
The Draft Plans contain the results of this site-specific evaluation of the treatment options identified in the Conceptual
Plans, and present the currently preferred option for treating the site's mixed waste. The Draft Plans have not yet
been evaluated as a whole for impacts on other DOE sites and to the overall DOE program. Changes in the preferred option
and associated schedules are possible as evaluation from the DOE-wide perspective progresses, as State-to-State
discussions take place, and as other stakeholder input is received. 
DOE defined a common framework to provide a consistent approach to Draft Plan development among all of the DOE sites.
This framework, developed with input from State representatives, established common terminology, objectives,
planning assumptions, and a recommended methodology for narrowing the alternatives presented in the Conceptual
Plan to the preferred options in the Draft Plan. Evaluation criteria included sound technical judgment; regulatory
compliance; environmental, health, and safety concerns; stakeholder involvement; implementability; and efficient
use of limited resources. 
The Draft Plans also follow a common format, consisting of a Background Volume and a Compliance Plan Volume, supplemented
by an Appendix(s). The Background Volume describes the site's treatment options, including the associated uncertainties,
budget status, and regulator and stakeholder reactions, when known. The Compliance Plan Volume identifies the preferred
treatment option(s) and associated schedules, and also broadly describes provisions to implement and update the
Plan once approved. When finalized, the Compliance Plan Volume is intended to contain information that will ultimately
be enforced through an Order. Each Draft Plan also includes an Appendix that explains how the options presented in
the Conceptual Plan were narrowed to select the preferred option. Some site Draft Plans include additional appendices
to present other related information. 
In conjunction with identifying treatment options, DOE is also evaluating options for disposal of mixed waste treatment
residuals, at the request of the States. The Background Volume of each Draft Plan contains a description of the process
for evaluating disposal options. 
A Draft Site Treatment Plan Summary Report is being prepared to present a compilation of the information contained
in the individual sites' Draft Plans. The Summary Report will also provide a preliminary indication of the configuration
that may emerge for the DOE complex as a whole, and is intended to useful for discussions among the States, EPA and other
interested parties. This Summary Report will include brief discussions of the Draft Plan development process, a
DOE complex-wide look at treatment options for the different mixed waste streams, information on waste characterization,
technology development and other related topics. The Summary Report will be released as soon as possible. 


III. Availability of Draft Site Treatment Plans and Opportunity for Comment 


The individual Draft Site Treatment Plan will be available at each site's public reading room or at nearby locations
by mid-September, 1994. To review or request information on a specific Draft Plan, a DOE contact name and reading room
address for each site can be obtained by calling the DOE Center for Environmental Management Information at 1-800-7EM-DATA.

<DOCTITLE>Contractor Litigation Costs Policies; Policies, Terms of Law Firm Engagement, and Allowability of Costs </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of interim policy statement. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy today publishes an interim Acquisition Letter for public comment that has been issued to
contracting officers who are responsible for the administration of management and operating contracts. The letter
sets forth interim policies regarding two contract clauses that are prescribed by the Department of Energy Acquisition
Regulation. The letter sets forth a statement of policy with regard to the terms of engagement that should be a condition
of any authorization to a current or former management and operating contractor to engage a law firm to defend a lawsuit.
The letter also sets forth policies for a contracting officer's consideration in determining whether particular
litigation costs are reasonable and therefore allowable. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy (Department) owns facilities in various locations in the United States which have been operated
by former and current management and operating contractors. In connection with these facilities, there is a substantial
amount of litigation against which the Department may elect to defend itself or authorize the contractor to defend.
The standard provisions of management and operating contracts allow contracting officers to authorize contractors
to engage lawyers to defend lawsuits, subject to such conditions as the contracting officers deem appropriate. 

See

 48 CFR 970.5204-31. The standard provisions of management and operating contracts also authorize contracting
officers to determine whether the costs charged are reasonable and therefore allowable when allocable to contract
work. 

See

 48 CFR 970.5204-13. 



Recently, the Department has experienced unacceptably high litigation costs from management and operating contractors
in connection with the defense of lawsuits where the Department has elected to have the contractor engage lawyers
to conduct the litigation. Moreover, contracting officers dealing with these costs have differed in their approaches
to determining whether a litigation cost is reasonable. The Department has an urgent need to provide for a more uniform
approach by contracting officers to such costs and to stem payment of unreasonable expenses. This need is particularly
compelling in light of the substantial dollar amounts at stake and the Department's budgetary situation. In view
of the foregoing, the Department has issued the Acquisition Letter set forth below as an interim policy, the effective
dates of which are set forth below. The Department will receive and consider public comment prior to issuing a final
version of this Acquisition Letter. 

The provisions of the policy are largely self-explanatory. They are based on past experience of the contractors,
the Department of Energy, and other federal agencies (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution
Trust Corporation) in managing and controlling litigation costs throughout the Nation, and should provide a reasonable
decisionmaking framework for contracting officers without being unnecessarily constraining. If any of the provisions
of the policy would be unreasonable as applied, contracting officers have discretion to depart from the policy based
upon particular facts and circumstances. 

The Department is seeking public comment on the interim Acquisition Letter in order to give the public, including
those persons who are affected by the policies, an opportunity to comment on the interim Letter before it is finalized.

Acquisition Letter 94-13, August 25, 1994. 



Authority:

 This Acquisition Letter (AL) is issued by the Procurement Executive pursuant to a delegation from the Secretary and
under authority of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) Subpart 901.301-70. 



Contents



 


I. Purpose



The purpose of this AL is to establish interim policies on the reasonableness of Management and Operating (``M&O'')
contractor litigation costs. 



II. Background



Under the allowable costs clause of the Department's M&O contracts, attorneys' fees and other litigation costs
are allowable only if reasonable and incurred in accordance with the Litigation and claims clause. The policies set
forth below are a prospective reference to aid in Contracting Officers' determinations as to whether contractor
litigation costs under M&O contracts are reasonable.

The Department recognizes that these policies can be most effectively achieved for pending cases through the cooperation
of the contractors and the law firms involved. The Department intends to work closely with the contractors to ensure
a smooth implementation that will not compromise the defense of pending matters. 



III. Guidance 



These policies apply to reimbursement of present and former M&O contractors for amounts paid to outside law firms
and consultants (``outside firms'') in connection with litigation to which the contractor is a party, except to the
extent the contractor's own litigation procedures or current retainer agreements contain more cost-restrictive
provisions. The Contracting Officer, or his or her designated representative (hereinafter ``Contracting Officer''),
may, after consultation with Department counsel, authorize an exception to the policies described below based upon
economy, the interests of the Government, or other good cause. These policies may be modified, from time to time, as
the Department determines appropriate. The Contracting Officer has authority to exclude from these policies cases
whose expected costs of defense are less than $25,000 and/or routine matters handled by outside counsel retained
and supervised by an insurance carrier. 



A. Interim Policies 



Contracting Officers shall refer to and consider the following policies in determining the reasonableness of contractor
litigation costs. The failure to specify or describe a particular category of cost in paragraphs III.A.1. through
III.A.10. does not imply that such category of cost is either allowable or unallowable. 



1. Terms Of Engagement 



In order for costs incurred by an M&O contractor for an outside firm to be considered reasonable, they shall be
incurred in accordance with the terms of engagement between the contractor and the outside firm which have been approved
by the Contracting Officer. The terms of engagement between the contractor and the outside firm shall incorporate
and include the policies included in paragraphs III.A.1. through III.A.10. of this AL. The terms of engagement shall
also provide that the outside firm will comply with the Department's Litigation Management Procedures, which, among
other things, require a Staffing and Resource Plan (for significant cases), periodic case assessments and budgets,
adequate audit provisions, and notification to the Department and the contractor of any significant change in the
Staffing and Resource Plan. 

a. 

Bills and invoices.

 All bills and invoices shall reflect the information and contents set forth in the model format of Attachment A. Any
bill or invoice shall also contain a certification signed by a representative of the outside law firm to the effect
that: 

``Under penalty of law, [the representative] acknowledges the expectation that the bill will be paid by the contractor
and that the contractor will be reimbursed by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department of Energy, and, based
on personal knowledge and a good faith belief, certifies that the bill is truthful and accurate, and that the services
and charges set forth herein comply with the terms of engagement and the policies set forth in [this Acquisition Letter],
and that the costs and charges set forth herein are necessary for the litigation.'' 

b. 

Audit. 

All terms of engagement must contain a provision for auditing expenditures under the terms of engagement to determine
and ensure compliance with the terms of engagement and the provisions of the prime contract, and to determine the accuracy
of any bill or invoice for the services of the outside firm. The provision shall include a statement that: 

 [The outside firm] expects that the costs of the services rendered under the terms of engagement will be paid
by the contractor and that the contractor will be reimbursed by the Federal Government through the U.S. Department
of Energy. 

 [The contractor] and the Department of Energy, its designated representative, and the General Accounting
Office, have the right upon request, at reasonable times and at reasonable locations, to inspect, copy, and audit
all records documenting billable fees and costs under the terms of engagement, the systems employed by [the outside
firm] to capture, record, and bill the fees and costs, and any other records relevant to the representation by the outside
firm under the terms of engagement. 

 [The outside firm] will retain all such records for a period of three (3) years after the final payment under
the terms of engagement. 

 The provision does not constitute a waiver of any applicable legal privilege, protection, or immunity with
respect to disclosure of these records to third parties. 



 2. Fees 



In determining whether fees or rates charged by an outside firm are reasonable for purposes of approving a contractor's
terms of engagement with an outside firm, the Contracting Officer shall consider whether the contractor sought the
lowest reasonably achievable fees or rates (including any currently available or possibly negotiable discounts)
from the outside firm, whether the contractor considered rates available from other firms providing comparable
services, and whether the contractor considered alternative rate structures such as flat, contingent, and other
innovative proposals. 



3. Profit And Overhead

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940831-2-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940831-2-00030 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The rate or fee structure shall include all outside firm ``overhead'' and ``profit,'' and, therefore, any additional
overhead or profit charged by the outside firm shall be considered unreasonable. Similarly, any markups by the outside
firm for supplies or services procured from third parties would be unreasonable. For instance, only the actual costs
of messenger services shall be allowed, whether the service was performed by the outside firm or a third party. Additionally,
any interest the contractor incurred on any outstanding (unpaid) bills from outside firms is not reimbursable under
the DEAR. 




4. Travel and Related Expenses 



Charges for air travel shall be the actual cost, not to exceed the coach class fare. Charges for local ground travel
shall be the actual cost of the taxi service, or the existing Internal Revenue Service's mileage deduction allowance
if the person drives his or her own automobile. Charges billed for meals, lodging and rental cars must be moderate.
The rates set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations will be deemed presumptively reasonable. 

See 

41 CFR ch. 301. Charges for luxury hotels, cars, or services such as movies and fitness facilities are neither necessary
nor reasonable. 


Travel by more than one person from an outside law or consulting firm to attend a deposition, court hearing, interview,
or meeting outside the person's home office shall not be considered reasonable except when authorized by contractor
counsel in accordance with procedures agreed upon with Department counsel. 


Any travel time may be reimbursed at a full rate for the portion of time during which the outside firm performs work for
the contractor. For air travel, any remaining travel time during normal working hours shall be reimbursed at 50 percent.
In no event is travel time for time during which work was performed for other clients reimbursable. 




5. Copying 



Copying charges shall not exceed ten cents a page, unless supported by a cost study and approved in advance by the Contracting
Officer. Copying projects where volume would generate substantial savings should be sent to outside vendors when
practicable and cheaper. As with costs for all supplies and services, the Contracting Officer should look to local
commercial rates as a benchmark. 



6. Telephone Charges and Faxes 



Charges billed for toll or long distance calls, including facsimile/telecopier transmissions, shall not exceed
the actual charge for each call, with no overhead or surcharge adjustment. 



7. Computer Time 



Charges for computer-assisted research shall not exceed the actual cost, with no overhead or surcharge adjustments.





8. Overtime and Certain Temporary Employees 



Secretarial and clerical overtime or costs of temporary support personnel billed by the outside firm shall not be
charged, unless the Contracting Officer approves such overtime or temporary support personnel or the cost is caused
or required by an emergency situation not of the contractor or the outside attorney's making. Time charged by summer
associates should be scrutinized for its efficiency and consistency with the Staffing and Resource Plan. 




9. Experts Employed by DOE Contractors 



If the contractor or outside counsel wishes to retain as a consultant in a matter an employee of another contractor
of the Department of Energy, the requesting contractor must receive prior approval from the Department of Energy,
which will attempt to furnish the expert directly through the contractor that currently employs the potential consultant.
This policy does not alter any applicable provisions of the prime contract with either the requesting or the employing
contractor. 




10. Specific Non-reimbursable Costs 




The contracting officer shall not consider for reimbursement any proposed costs by the contractor for any direct
costs incurred by outside firms for the following items: entertainment; alcoholic beverages; secretarial or clerical
support time (except as provided under paragraph 8, above); word processing; computers or general application software;
client development and related activities; trade publications, books, treatises, background materials, and other
similar documents; professional/educational seminars and conferences; preparation of bills; parking fines or
any other fines or penalties for illegal conduct; and food, beverages and the like when the attorney or consultant
is not on travel status and away from the home office. An exception may be made, however, for reasonable expenses for
working meals during an in-house meeting not in excess of $10 per person. No outside firm's bills are to contain any
items representing disbursements made for the benefit of the contractor's employees, such as meals or lodging for
contractor's current personnel (other than conference meals at which contractor personnel are present under this
paragraph). 



IV. Effective Dates



These policies are effective with respect to determinations of reasonableness and allowability of costs for services
rendered and expenses incurred: 


1. on or after October 1, 1994, for all class actions; 


2. on or after November 1, 1994, for all non-class actions commenced on or after October 1, 1994; and 


3. on or after February 1, 1995, for all non-class-action litigation commenced before October 1, 1994. 



V. Expiration Date



The Department is seeking public comment on these policies. This AL will remain in effect on an interim basis until
the Department takes further action after reviewing any public comments on these policies.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 A Request for Preproposal Applications is available. The purpose of the request is to set forth the eligibility and
submission requirements, evaluation criteria and schedule for establishing hazardous substance research, technology
transfer and training activities at Minority Academic Institutions (MAIs), in cooperation with the five Hazardous
Substance Research Centers (HSRCs), as authorized by section 311(d) of Superfund, and as amended by section 209 of
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988. These activities will be competitively awarded. 



The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes that minority academic institutions (MAIs) are underrepresented
in research and other activities relating to hazardous substance management. To improve this situation, EPA is making
funds available to enhance the ability of MAIs to participate in research, technology transfer, training, and academic
development activities in collaboration with EPA's five HSRCs. The program rationale and design, areas of interest,
eligibility requirements, and other important information are described in the solicitation.

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has extended temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide halosulfuron (MON 12000) Methyl 5-[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino]
carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1-

H

-pyrazole-4-carboxylate in or on certain raw agricultural commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1993 (58 FR 32535) announcing the establishment of temporary tolerances for residues of the herbicide

halosulfuron (MON 12000) Methyl 5-[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino] carbonylaminosulfonyl]-3-chloro-1-methyl-1-

H

-pyrazole-4-carboxylate 
in or on the raw agricultural commodities field corn grain at 0.1 part per million (ppm); field corn forage at 0.3 ppm
and field corn fodder at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances were issued in response to pesticide petition (PP) 2G4073, submitted
by Monsanto Agricultural Co., 800 North Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63167.


These temporary tolerances have been extended to permit the continued marketing of the raw agricultural commodities
named above when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permits 524-EUP-74 and 524-EUP-76,
which are being extended under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub.
L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136).
The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the extension
of these temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have been extended
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permits and with the following
provisions:
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permits.
2. Monsanto Agricultural Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have
a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request
make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration.
These tolerances expire April 1, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permits and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permits are revoked or if any experience with or scientific data
on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

 A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to EPA's Statement of Policy entitled, ``Microbial
Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,''
published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received from Mycogen Corporation of San Diego, California (53219-NMP-R).
The proposed small-scale field trial involves the release of a non-indigenous microbial pesticide 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 serovar 

japonensis

 strain 

Buibui

 (B.t. buibui) into the field in order to evaluate the efficacy of this microbial pesticide against certain Coleopteran
pests for the control of white grubs in turfgrass relative to the commercially available pesticides. 

Field trials will be classified as small or micro-plot studies and will be conducted within areas of approximately
50 ft. by 100 ft. Treatments will include three to five replicates per treatment. Testing will consist of one or two
applications which coincide with specific stages of larval development, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd larval instars. 
Field trials will be conducted using prototype liquid flowable formulations and some limited testing with dry granular
formulations. Liquid treatments will be applied to plots in the test area using a handheld compressed air sprayer
with nozzles. Granular formulations will be applied using a pre-calibrated drop spreader. The proposed field trials
will be conducted during July - September 1994 and monitored 21 days following initial application. Following the
review of American Cyanamid Company's application and any comments received in response to this notice, EPA will
decide whether or not an experimental use permit is required.

<DOCTITLE>Accredited Training Programs Under The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 National Directory of AHERA Accredited Courses (NDAAC); Notice of Availability of New Edition.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Effective August 31, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA
Accredited Courses (NDAAC). This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training
providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
(AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar
listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the 

Federal Register

. The August 31, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on May 31, 1994, may be ordered through the
NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors
who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or
design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and
commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA
therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so
that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining
the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation
and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses
and organizations.


Previously, EPA had published this listing in the 

Federal Register

 on a quarterly basis. The last 

Federal Register

 listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document
even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at
the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities.

<DOCTITLE>Open Meeting on the Definition of Solid Waste and Hazardous Waste Recycling </DOCTITLE>



Agency: 

Environmental Protection Agency.

 

Action: 

Notice of public meeting.

 



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting two public small group discussions with representatives
of several companies potentially affected by recommendations from an internal Agency task force for revising the
regulatory definition of solid waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery ACT (RCRA). Other attendees to
these meetings would be afforded the opportunity at the appropriate times to ask questions or comment on the small
group discussions.



The revisions to the definition of solid waste are intended to eliminate the disincentives to the safe recycling of
hazardous waste while maintaining full protection of human health and the environment. They are also intended to
reduce any possible current underregulation of hazardous waste recycling.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Agency has selected representatives from the following companies who are intimately involved with and knowledgeable
about hazardous waste recycling to provide feedback on potential revisions to the definition of solid waste as it

<DOCTITLE>Listing of Controlled Carriers Under the Shipping Act of 1984</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Maritime Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Amendments to list of controlled carriers.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Maritime Commission is adding Vietnam Sea Transport and Chartering Company and POL-America, Inc. to
the list of controlled carriers, subject to the advance tariff filing and other regulatory requirements of section
9 of the Shipping Act of 1984. The Commission is removing the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines and
the Far Eastern Shipping Company of Russia, from the list of controlled carriers. Information received indicates
that they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier pursuant to section 3(8) of the Shipping Act of 1984.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sections 3(8) and 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(8) and 1708, provide for the identification
and regulation of certain state-controlled carriers operating in the waterborne foreign commerce of the United
States. The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') has determined that Vietnam Sea Transport and Chartering
Company (``Vietnam Sea Transport''), headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and POL-America, Inc. (``POL-America'')
headquartered in Gdynia, Poland, meet the definition of a controlled carrier under section 3(8) of the 1984 Act, and
are, therefore, being added to the list of controlled carriers.



Upon inquiry by the Commission, Vietnam Sea Transport responded that its operating assets are directly owned by the
Government of Vietnam (``GOV'') and that the GOV has the right to approve or disapprove the appointment of a majority
of the directors, including the chief operating or executive officer of the carrier. Vietnam Sea Transport advised
that it intends to operate at least two Vietnamese-flag vessels in its service in the U.S. cross-trades.

POL-America responded that Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia, Poland, a government-controlled carrier, holds the majority
interest (70 percent) of POL-America. Under the 1984 Act, government ownership is deemed to exist where the majority
interest of a carrier is held by a government entity or instrumentality. In this case, Polish Ocean Lines of Gdynia,
according to Commission records, is owned by the Polish Government. All vessels operated by POL-America are under
the Polish flag.

The Commission has determined to delete the National Shipping Corporation of the Philippines (``NSCP'') and the
Far Eastern Shipping Company (``FESCO''), currently named ``FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C.,'' from the list of controlled
carriers, because they no longer meet the definition of a controlled carrier set forth in section 3(8) of the 1984 Act.

Information submitted to the Commission by NSCP indicates that the Government of the Philippines (``GOP'') sold
all of its rights, title and interest in NSCP's three vessels of Philippine registry, as well as all of the issued and
outstanding shares in NSCP, to Madrigal-Wan Hai Lines Corporation (``Madrigal''), a private corporation organized
under the laws of the Philippines. Sixty percent of Madrigal is said to be owned by A. P. Madrigal Steamship Company,
Inc., a private Philippine Corporation owned by Philippine nationals, and forty percent is owned by Wan Hai Lines
Limited, a private Taiwan corporation owned by non-Philippine nationals. The Commission is also advised that the
GOP has no right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of the directors, or the chief operating or executive
officer of NSCP.

The Commission has determined that because NSCP is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the GOP, it no
longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list of controlled carriers.

FESCO Joint-Stock P.L.C., the legal successor to the Far Eastern Shipping Company, provided information advising
that it was created pursuant to the Russian Federation President's Decree No. 721, which enacted measures allowing
state enterprises to incorporate as private limited companies_stock societies. FESCO was organized and registered
in the Russian Federation on December 3, 1993.

FESCO reported that as of July 15, 1994, fifty-five percent of the company's shares belong to individual shareholders
comprised mainly of current and former employees of FESCO. FESCO further advises that: twenty-five percent of the
shares belong to 70 legal entities; the remaining twenty percent of the shares belong to Primorsk Region Committee
for the State Property Management, a government entity, which is required to sell these shares either to legal entities
or individuals before December 3, 1995; FESCO's operating assets are neither directly nor indirectly owned or controlled
by the Russian Federation or any governmental entity; and that the Russian Federation does not have the right to appoint
or disapprove the appointment of the directors or the chief operating or executive officer of the company.

The Commission has determined that because the Russian Federation neither owns a majority interest in FESCO, nor
has the right to appoint or disapprove the appointment of a majority of its directors, or its chief operating or executive
officer, FESCO no longer meets the definition of a controlled carrier and is, therefore, being deleted from the list
of controlled carriers.

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a letter sent to known manufacturers of blood establishment
computer software products. In the letter, FDA advised these manufacturers that it considers these computer software
products to be devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) because these products aid in the prevention
of disease by identifying unsuitable donors and preventing the release of unsuitable blood and blood components
for transfusion or for further manufacturing use. The letter, accompanied by a registration package and device listing,
was intended to notify manufacturers of the requirements of the act, to facilitate registration of these manufacturers
as medical device manufacturers, and to further ensure the safety of the blood supply.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a March 31, 1994, letter sent to known manufacturers of blood
establishment computer software products. The letter was sent by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER) to notify these manufacturers that their products meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the
act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)) and to facilitate registration of these manufacturers with FDA as device manufacturers. The
regulatory approach outlined in the March 31, 1994, letter is part of the effort by FDA to further ensure the safety
of the blood supply. This notice is being issued to ensure that all interested persons are aware of the requirements
of the act and have access to the information in the letter. 


In order to facilitate registration with FDA as a device manufacturer, the March 31, 1994, letter was accompanied
by a registration package. To obtain a copy of the registration package and device listing forms and instructions,
write to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (address above). Manufacturers of such software are required
to register their establishments and list their devices. Each manufacturer is also required to submit a premarket
notification or application for premarket approval to CBER for each device unless the manufacturer can demonstrate
that the manufacturer commercially distributed the device in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976 (the date
of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), and has continued to distribute the device without any significant
changes to the device. Guidance on how to prepare a premarket submission as well as device listing information will
be sent to each manufacturer after they have registered. The letter stated that manufacturers should submit premarket
submissions to CBER no later than March 31, 1995.
Additionally, the letter stated that FDA intends to inspect blood establishment software vendors in the interim
period and to focus primarily on assessing compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations
for devices (21 CFR part 820). FDA also will review and assess procedures for investigating reports of product problems
and defects, implementing and evaluating corrective actions, and for notifying FDA and customers of the corrective
actions. The complete text of the letter follows:


March 31, 1994

To: Blood Establishment Computer Software Manufacturers 
Dear Sir/Madam:



The purpose of this letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers software products
intended for use in the manufacture of blood and blood components or for the maintenance of data that personnel use
in making decisions regarding the suitability of donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion
or further manufacture to be devices under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21
U.S.C. 321(h)).
These software products are designed to receive and store data used by blood establishments during the manufacturing
process, from determining donor suitability through component processing, testing, and labeling to product release.
They are designed to receive and store data regarding blood donor status, including donors' answers to health history
questions and the results of laboratory tests, including blood grouping and typing, hepatitis, and antibody to the
human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). Blood establishment personnel later access and use the data to determine
whether donors are suitable and whether blood or blood components are free from disease-causing agents transmissible
by blood, such as hepatitis and HIV. In addition, the data are used to label blood and blood components prior to release
for use in hospitals and other health care facilities or for further manufacturing. Because they aid in the prevention
of disease (e.g., hepatitis, HIV, etc.) by identifying unsuitable donors and preventing release of unsuitable blood
and blood components for transfusion or for further manufacturing use, these software products meet the definition
of device under the act.
Facilities that manufacture and distribute these software products are subject to the device provisions of the act
and FDA's device regulations, including establishment registration, product listing, premarket notification
or approval, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP), and adverse event reporting. FDA's CGMP regulations
for devices appear at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820 and the MDR regulations at 
21 CFR, Part 803. 
According to FDA's information, your facility manufactures software intended for use in the manufacture of blood
and blood components. Consequently, you are required under the act to register your establishment and list your devices.
In addition, your manufacturing operations are required to be in compliance with CGMP for devices, and you must report
adverse events and other problems as required by FDA's Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations. 
We are enclosing a registration package for your convenience. We will forward a device listing package to you in the
near future. When completing the device listing form (Form FDA 2892), identify your product as Software, Blood-Bank,
Stand Alone Products, Product Code 75MMH. The registration form should be submitted within 60 days of receipt of this
letter if you intend to continue to distribute software products to blood establishments for use in manufacturing.
In addition, you are required to submit a premarket notification or application for premarket approval for each of
your devices unless you can demonstrate that you commercially distributed the devices in interstate commerce prior
to May 28, 1976 (the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments) and have continued to do so without any significant
changes to these devices. If you claim such preamendment status for any product(s), please complete only the registration
form, and send it to: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ-300), 2098 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD,
20850.
If you do not intend to submit a premarket submission, and intend to submit proof of the claimed preamendment distribution,
this information should be sent to: Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Division of Blood Applications
(HFM-370), 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD, 20852-1448. Finally, if you do not currently manufacture
software products for blood establishments, please advise CBER promptly.
When we forward the product listing information to you, we will include guidance on how to prepare your premarket submissions.
If you have questions about the content or format of a premarket submission once you have reviewed our guidance, CBER
staff are available to help answer such questions. Premarket submissions should be submitted to CBER no later than
March 31, 1995.
In the interim, FDA will continue to conduct inspections of blood establishment software vendors. These inspections
will include, among other things, a review of your standards for software development, testing, validation, and
quality assurance. The primary focus of these inspections will be to assess compliance with the CGMP regulations
for devices (21 CFR, Part 820).
The agency will also review and assess your procedures for investigating reports of product problems and defects
and for implementing and evaluating corrective actions. We will also 
review and assess your procedures for notifying your customers and the agency when you take corrective actions.
Please be advised that during this interim period if a manufacturer of software products for blood establishments
is not making good faith efforts to comply with the act and FDA's regulations as stated above, the agency will not hesitate
to take the appropriate steps to bring the firm into compliance.
If you have questions concerning: (1) the preparation of the establishment registration and device listing notification,
contact Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Division of Small Manufacturers (HFZ-220), at 301-443-6597,
or (2) guidance for premarket submissions, contact Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Division of Blood
Applications (HFM-370), at 301-594-2012. 


Sincerely yours, 


Kathryn C. Zoon, Ph.D.

Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated
October 13, 1992. 

This program announcement is subject to the appropriation of funds. Applicants are advised that this program announcement
is a contingency action being taken to assure that should funds become available for this purpose, they can be awarded
in a timely fashion consistent with the needs of the program as well as to provide for even distribution of funds throughout
the fiscal year. The Administration's budget request for FY 1995 includes $2,300,000 for this program. Total continuation
support recommended is $2,073,000. Under the Administration's budget request, it is anticipated that $227,000
will be available to support 2 competing awards averaging $100,000. 



Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1994, HRSA reviewed 72 applications for Allied Health

Other Considerations 



In addition, the following funding factor will be applied in determining funding of approved applications. A funding
preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories
or groups of approved applications in a discretionary program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines
the grant award in a formula grant program. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



Funding Preference 



The statutory preference identified in section 767(b)(2) and the statutory preference identified in section 791(a)
of the PHS Act have been combined in the following preference which will be applied to Allied Health Project Grants
for fiscal year 1995: Preference shall be given to qualified applicants that_ 

(A) Expand and maintain first-year enrollment by not less than 10 percent over enrollments in base year 1992; or

(B) Demonstrate that not less than 20 percent of the graduates of such training programs during the preceding 2-year
period are working in medically underserved communities (high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having
the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities); or

(C) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 



Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



The minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' were established in FY 1994 after
public comment (59 FR 23889, dated May 9, 1994). The Administration is extending these minimum percentages in FY 1995.


``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic year 1992-93 or academic year 1993-94,
whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings.
Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as part of a fellowship or other educational
experience can be counted. 

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. 

Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 15741, dated April 4, 1994. 



Information Requirements Provision

7. The potential of the project to continue on a 
self-sustaining basis after the period of grant 
support; and 

8. The adequacy of the project's plan to develop and 
use methods designed to attract and maintain 
minority and disadvantaged students to train as 
physician assistants. 



Other Considerations 



In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining the funding of approved applications: 

1. Funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications, such as competing continuation projects ahead of new projects. 

2. Funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores when applications meet specified
objective criteria. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for a funding factor will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



General Statutory Funding Preference 



As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference 
will be given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice 
settings having the principal focus of serving 
residents of medically underserved communities; or 

(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for 
which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This
preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for
approval by the peer review group. 

``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1992-93 or
academic year 1993-94, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical
practice in these settings. 

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate
of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of the academic year 1993-94 graduates are working in these settings. 

Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference was published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 15741, dated April 4, 1994. 

To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1995, criteria for the statutory and the administrative funding
preferences have been developed to apply only to them. These criteria are provided in the application materials.




Funding Preference for Fiscal Year 1995 



The following funding preference which was established in FY 1994 after public comment at 59 FR 2624, dated May 9, 1994,
will be continued in FY 1995: 

A funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate that
(a) more than 50 percent of their graduates in 1994 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general internal
medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1992, 1993, and 1994)
entered a generalist specialty. 



Funding Priority for FY 1995 



The following priority which was established in FY 1994 after public comment at 59 FR 2065, dated May 19, 1994, will
be continued in FY 1995: 

A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over
the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority
or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes. 

To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1995, criteria for the funding priority have been developed to
apply only to them. These criteria are provided in the application materials.

Notice of Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and To Conduct Scoping for the Barrick
Goldstrike Mines Inc. Betze Project in Elko and Eureka Counties, NV

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and to conduct scoping for the Barrick
Goldstrike Mines Inc. Betze Project in Elko and Eureka Counties, Nevada.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Land Management,
Elko District Office, prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) with respect to Barrick Goldstrike Mines
Inc.'s (Barrick's) Betze Project. The Final EIS and Record of Decision for the Betze Project were issued on June 10,
1991. The Final EIS included a description of the environmental impacts projected to result from groundwater pumping
conducted by Barrick to lower the local groundwater elevations below the proposed Betze mining operations. Since
the Betze EIS was issued, Barrick's implementation of the pumping operations and its monitoring of groundwater elevations
have provided new information regarding the pumping requirements and potential environmental impacts of pumping
operations. The Bureau has determined that a Supplemental EIS should be prepared to assess the potential environmental
impacts of the pumping and water management operations associated with Barrick's mining operations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In response to a Plan of Operations submitted in April 1989, the Bureau of Land Management, Elko District Office, prepared
an EIS with respect to Barrick's Betze Project. The Draft EIS for the Betze Project was issued on January 11, 1991, and
a sixty-day public comment period, including two public meetings, followed. The Final EIS and Record of Decision
for the Betze Project were issued on June 10, 1991. The Betze Project includes the development of Barrick's existing
Post Pit laterally and deeper, to completely mine the Betze Deposit. Because the Betze Deposit is located below the
elevation of the local groundwater system, Barrick must pump groundwater from the mine area to lower the groundwater
table below mining operation levels. The Betze EIS described the projected pumping and water management operations
and assessed the environmental impacts of those operations.


Since the Betze EIS was issued, Barrick through operational experience and monitoring, has acquired additional
information regarding the pumping rates required to lower groundwater elevations in the mining area. This includes
the nature and extent of the rock type from which groundwater is being pumped and the hydrologic connection between
the groundwater being pumped and surface waters in the vicinity of Barrick's mining operations. This new information
indicates that the highly transmissive area from which the groundwater is being pumped is more extensive than projected
at the time the Betze EIS was prepared. Consequently, the volume of water pumped and the rate of pumping is greater than
originally predicted and analyzed. Barrick's monitoring program also indicates that groundwater levels are being
drawn down over a larger area than projected at the time of the Betze EIS. The monitoring program has also provided additional
data regarding the potential hydrologic connection between the groundwater being pumped and surface waters in the
vicinity of Barrick's operations.
Barrick is presently pumping approximately 68,500 gallons per minute (gpm) to lower the groundwater table. Barrick
uses approximately 2,000 to 4,000 gpm for mining and milling operations. Water not used in mining and milling flows
into the TS Reservoir which is located about four miles southwest of the Betze Pit. During half the year about 15,000
gpm is used for irrigation of alfalfa fields located down gradient from the reservoir in Boulder Valley. Another 20,000
gpm is injected or infiltrated into the groundwater in a portion of Boulder Valley. The bulk of the remaining water
in the reservoir infiltrates into the water table through a high-angle fault located within the impoundment area.
As a result, the water table beneath the reservoir has risen and mounded in Boulder Valley. This mounding has also created
several springs and associated wetlands in the valley where the groundwater has intercepted the surface.

The Bureau is proposing to contract with a third party for the preparation of a supplement to the Betze EIS that would
describe the new information gathered since the Betze EIS was prepared and would describe any changes in the projected
environmental impacts as a result of the new information. In addition, the Supplemental EIS will also assess the cumulative
impacts of groundwater pumping to lower elevations and for longer periods of time associated with mining of other
nearby deposits within the area from which groundwater would be pumped, e.g., the Deep Post and Meikle. It is anticipated
that the Supplemental EIS will focus attention on five issues of special concern to the BLM: livestock operations,
threatened and endangered species, wetland and riparian vegetation, wildlife and fisheries resources, and surface
and groundwater resources including the potential effects from Barrick's operations on the Humboldt River.
The Betze EIS Record of Decision included stipulations requiring Barrick to monitor the effect of its pumping operations
on groundwater and also included stipulations specifically intended to mitigate the potential impacts of Barrick's
groundwater pumping operations. The stipulations also included a requirement that Barrick establish a $1,000,000.00
fund for monitoring and mitigation of possible adverse environmental impacts that were not specifically identified
in the Betze EIS. The Supplemental EIS will evaluate a range of mitigating measures to minimize these environmental
impacts and to assure that Barrick's operations do not result in undue or unnecessary degradation of public lands.
The special fund described above would be applied to any additional mitigation subsequently identified in the Supplemental
EIS.
It is important that those interested in this project participate in the scoping and commenting process. To achieve
the best possible analysis, comments should be as specific as possible. The tentative project schedule is as follows:



Begin Public Comment Period_September 2, 1994
Issuance of Draft Supplemental EIS_August 30, 1995
File Final Supplemental EIS_December 29, 1995



Comments on the scope of the supplemental EIS should be directed to the attention of Nick Rieger, Betze Project Leader
at the Bureau of Land Management, Elko District Office, P.O. Box 831, Elko, Nevada 89803. Comments must be received
by the close of business on October 3, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Mt. Shasta Historic District; Determination of Eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.




On March 11, 1994, the Mt. Shasta Historic District was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. The property was determined to meet National Register Criterion A (associated with important events)
in the area of Ethnic Heritage: Native American because of its long history of use and traditional importance to several
different Native American tribes. This finding was based upon nearly a dozen publicly-available professional reports
and approximately 200 letters submitted by the Forest Service to the Keeper of the National Register, which address
the historical and cultural significance of Mt. Shasta. The National Park Service received additional letters regarding
the significance of Mt. Shasta. The reports were prepared for the Forest Service as part of its survey to identify properties
that are eligible for listing in the National Register under its responsibilities under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966. A copy of the determination is available from the National Register of Historic
Places, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127.

The documentation previously submitted to the National Register indicates that the entire Mt. Shasta is significant
and the property, most appropriately, should be classified as a ``district.'' The boundary of the Mt. Shasta Historic
District is: ``The northernmost point is a point on Military Pass Road approximately midway between the Southern
Pacific Railroad tracks and Highway 97, thence westerly midway between the railroad tracks and the highway to its
intersection with the National Forest boundary, thence south along the National Forest boundary to Howard east of
the town of Mt. Shasta, thence following the McCloud River Railroad tracks eastward to the Pilgrim Creek Road, thence
northeast to Coonrod Flat, thence northwest along Ash Creek to Military Pass Road, thence back to the point of beginning.''
Based on Forest Service documentation, this area has been established using a mixture of geographic referents, including
manmade features (e.g., railroad tracks) and natural features (e.g., buttes). Within this boundary are all the specific
places mentioned in the historical studies and recent interviews.
Since the determination of eligibility was made, property owners within the boundary of the determined eligible
area and individuals nationwide have written to us either endorsing or disagreeing with the eligibility of the property.
In order to accommodate those who wish to provide new information on whether or not this property meets the National
Register Criteria for Evaluation or on the scope of the district's boundary, the National Park Service is providing
a 60 day comment period on these issues. The National Register Criteria for Evaluation are set forth below.
Anyone wishing to submit additional information bearing on the historic significance and/or the extent of the boundary
should do so within 60 days of the date of this notice. A written statement on the determination of eligibility will
be issued after the close of the comment period and review of all comments. The determination of eligibility remains
in effect pending issuance of this written statement.
Comments should be addressed to the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,
Washington, DC 20013-7127.

National Register Criteria for Evaluation


National Register criteria define, for the nation as a whole, the scope and nature of historic and archeological properties
that are considered for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present
in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history;
or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the
work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction; or

D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history.
Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions
or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed history
buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within
the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However, such properties will qualify
if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories:
A. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical
importance; or 
B. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural
value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or
C. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building
directly associated with his productive life;
D. A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age,
from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or
E. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner
as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived;
or
F. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, traditional, or symbolic value has invested it with
its own historical significance; or
G. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement on the Red Bluff Diversion Dam Fish Passage Program, Sacramento Canals Unit, Central
Valley Project, California </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Reclamation, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends
to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the fish passage capability at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD).
The EIS, in conjunction with the ongoing planning study, will evaluate alternative methods to improve fish passage
both upstream and downstream on the Sacramento River. Inefficient fish passage at RBDD has been identified as a contributing
factor in the decline in the populations of anadromous fishes (mainly salmon and steelhead) in the upper Sacramento
River. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Sacramento River supports the largest run of Chinook salmon and provides more spawning habitat for them than any
other river in the State of California. Each year, four different runs of Chinook salmon spawn in the Sacramento River
(spring, fall, late fall, winter). Closure of the RBDD gates in August 1966 restricted upstream passage and created
additional mortality factors for all four Chinook runs and steelhead. The most significant decline has been experienced
by the winter-run Chinook salmon, now protected under Federal and State Endangered Species Acts. The winter-run
is listed as endangered by both the Federal and State acts. 



The objectives of the planning study are to improve fish passage capability at the RBDD for upstream and downstream
migrations on the river while attempting to: 

(1) Continue water deliveries to the Tehama-Colusa Canal and Corning Canal systems in the quantities and according
to the timing necessary to meet demands; 

(2) Maintain existing authorized purposes of the Central Valley Project; and, 

(3) Otherwise prevent serious adverse impacts. 

A public scoping process integrated with the ongoing planning study will be used to elicit information for use in determining
the scope of the environmental impacts and issues related to the proposal and to determine alternative methods to
accomplish the goals of the project. The results of the scoping process will help Reclamation develop concepts for
improvement of fish passage and to determine the scope and extent of the impact analysis. Integration of the scoping
study with the planning study, before engineering feasibilities of the alternatives have been determined, will
significantly prolong the scoping process and make it more exhaustive. That is typical. However, it will maximize
the opportunity for public involvement in the development of alternatives. The scoping process may consist of public
meetings, private consultation, written comments or combinations of these. A subsequent notice will be published
in the 

Federal Register

 at least 30 days prior to the first formal, public scoping meeting.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination
(ID) (Order No. 132) issued on July 28, 1994, by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned
investigation extending the date for issuance of the ALJ's initial determination on violation until November 29,
1994, at the latest.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission instituted this investigation concerning allegations of section 337 violations in the importation
of recombinantly produced human growth hormone on September 29, 1993. Complainant Genentech Inc. (``Genentech'')
alleges infringement of claims of four U.S. patents owned by Genentech. 


On July 21, 1994, respondents Bio-Technology General Corp. and Biotechnology General (Israel) (collectively,
``BTG'') and respondents Novo-Nordisk A/S; Novo-Nordisk of North America; Novo-Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;
and ZymoGenetics, Inc. (collectively, ``Novo'') filed a motion to delay issuance of the initial determination on
violation. The motion for delay was filed in order to give the ALJ more time to consider whether to reopen the evidentiary
record in light of documents that had recently become available to respondents. Genentech had previously claimed
privilege as to these documents, but that privilege was deemed waived as a result of an inadvertent production to the
Eli Lilly Company in concurrent multidistrict litigation, 

In Re Recombinant DNA Technology Patent and Contract Litigation, 

30 USPQ2d 1881 (S.D. Ind. 1994). No petitions for review of the ID were filed. 
This action is taken under authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1337) and sections 210.55
and 210.59(a) of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 210.55, 210.59(a)). Copies
of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available for inspection
during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission,

Privacy Act of 1974; Modified System of Records


Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Office of the Deputy Attorney General proposes to modify the
following system of records:



Special Candidates for Presidential Appointments Records System, Justice/DAG-008



Specifically, the above system name, as it now appears in the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systems of records,
is revised to read:



Special Candidates for Presidential Appointments and Noncareer SES Positions Records System, Justice/DAG-008



In addition, a number of minor edits are made to the system of records to improve readability, to expand appointments
covered by the system and to modify two existing routine uses. We have also added a ``Purpose'' statement to better
inform the public regarding the nature of this system of records.
The current notice indicates that the ``Categories of individuals covered by the system'' include individuals being
considered for presidential appointments as ``heads of divisions or sections'' of the Department of Justice. The
categories of individuals covered by the system have been modified to include deputy division heads and noncareer
SES positions.
The routine use permitting disclosure to the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), General Services Administration
(GSA) for records management inspections has been modified. The routine use has been modified consistent with Public
Law 98-497 (44 U.S.C. 2102) which renamed NARS as the ``National Archives and Records Administration'' (NARA),
and established it as a separate agency which nevertheless would continue to share its records management inspection
responsibilities with GSA. Accordingly, the routine use has been changed to show that NARA and GSA share responsibility
for records management inspections conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906.
The routine use which permits disclosure for law enforcement purposes has been modified to indicate that the record
must indicate a violation or a potential violation of law before it may be disclosed to law enforcement agencies.
Comments may be addressed to Robert M. Zanger, Systems Policy Staff, Information Resources Management, Justice
Management Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530 (room 850, WCTR Building). Please submit any comments
by September 30, 1994.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from August 8, 1994, through
August 19, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on August 17, 1994 (59 FR 42332). 



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By September 30, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a
hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of a hearing or an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).

Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, Plymouth County, Massachusetts




Date of amendment request: 

June 9, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would increase the allowed out-of-service time to increase from 7 days to 14 days for the automatic
depressurization system (ADS), the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system and the reactor core isolation
cooling (RCIC)
system. The proposed change includes a change to Section 4.5.H, ``Maintenance of Filled Discharge Pipe'' to reflect
Amendment 149, issued September 28, 1993.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Safety criteria used to determine the acceptability of extending continued operation with one ADS valve, the HPCI
or RCIC system out-of-service (OOS) is consistent with Pilgrim's licensing basis. For example, events with the expected
frequency of occurrence greater than once-per-reactor lifetime are required to meet the transient MCPR [minimum
critical power ratio] thermal limit: more than 99.9% of the fuel rods are expected to avoid boiling transition. Very
low probability events, such as a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident], are required to satisfy the criteria of 10CFR50.46:
the primary criterion being that the Peak Cladding Temperatures (PCT) be maintained less than 2200
 F.

For intermediate frequency events, e.g. safe shutdown in the event of a fire, 10CFR50 Appendix R involves a ``no fuel
damage'' criterion. To evaluate these types of events, the GE [General Electric] SAFER/GESTR-LOCA licensing methodology
was used to calculate the system responses and PCTs.

Analyses performed by Pilgrim's NSSS [nuclear steam supply system] vendor, General Electric, [***] for various
limiting-case scenarios involving ADS, HPCI, or RCIC out-of-service situations demonstrated 10CFR50.46 limits
(i.e. a PCT less than 2200
 F) were met. (The most severe PCT was 1500
 F). The core damage frequency analysis for Pilgrim is unchanged by operating Pilgrim in accordance with this
proposed amendment. The 14 day OOS for HPCI, RCIC and ADS also conforms to the 00S time for these systems found in BWR
[boiling-water reactor] Standard Technical Specifications. Hence, increasing the allowed 00S time from 7 to 14
days does not result in a challenge to fuel cladding integrity or BWR Standard Technical Specifications, and operating
Pilgrim in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

The removal of the association between LPCI [low-pressure coolant injection] and Core Spray system testing and surveilling
their filled discharge pipes is an administrative change because the specified surveillance frequency is unchanged.
This proposed change reflects Amendment #149, issued by the NRC September 28, 1993, and is proposed to ensure consistency
between Pilgrim's Technical Specification sections. This administrative change will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
As discussed above, a variety of limiting-case scenarios were analyzed to demonstrate the effects of increasing
the 00S time for one ADS valve, the HPCI system, or the RCIC system. The conclusion of the analyses is that this proposed
change does not violate Pilgrim's licensing basis or 10CFR50.46 requirements. 
Some scenarios result in elevated PCTs, but they are still significantly below the 10CFR50.46 limit of 2200
 F. Therefore, since the licensing-basis and code required PCT continues to be met and because the proposed change
comports the requirements of 

BWR Standard Technical Specifications, operating Pilgrim in
accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated. 
As discussed in above question 1, the proposed change to section 4.5.H.1 is administrative and does not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

Certain scenarios analyzed for system unavailability result in evaluated PCTs. However, these elevated PCTs are
significantly below the 10CFR50.46 limit of 2200
 F. Therefore, there is no reduction in the safety margin for PCT resulting from the change from 7 to 14 days. The
proposed change also corresponds to the requirements of BWR Standard Technical Specifications concerning 00S for
HPCI, RCIC and ADS. Therefore, operating Pilgrim Station in accordance with this proposed amendment does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis, and based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 22, 1994


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendment would implement a performance based assessment program, including corresponding organizational
and functional changes. Specifically, the changes affect the Independent Review (IR) function, the independent
assessment of plant activity and the Independent Safety Engineering Group. These functions will be performed by
the proposed Nuclear Assessment Section (NAS). The NAS would perform internal evaluations and assessment activities
and serve as plant management's staff for the objective oversight of plant performance relating to nuclear safety,
reliability, and quality. The NAS's fundamental role will be to: (1) assist plant management in the early identification
of issues which may prevent the plant from achieving quality performance on a sustained basis; and (2) ensure effective
correction of deficiencies. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because it is a programmatic and administrative change which does not physically alter any
safety-related systems, nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform their functions.
Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed amendment does not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated in Item 1, the proposed amendment is a programmatic and administrative change which does not
physically alter any safety-related systems; nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform
their functions. Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because it is a programmatic
and administrative change which provides assurance that plant operations continue to be conducted in a safe manner
through the performance based assessment programs. As stated in Item 1, the proposed amendment does not physically
alter any safety-related systems; nor does it affect the way in which any safety-related systems perform their functions.
Since the design of the facility and system operating parameters are not changing, the proposed amendment does not

Date of amendment request: 

July 28, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change TS Sections 5.3.1.3, 5.4.2.1, 5.4.22, and the Section 5 references to allow the
use of fuel enriched to 4.95 plus 0.05 weight percent (w/o) U235.
The proposed license change is required to support delivery of reload batch enrichments anticipated for Cycle 17
and beyond. These reloads will require the use of fuel enrichments exceeding the current TS limit of 4.20 plus 0.05
weight percent (w/o) U

235

 (nominal 4.20). 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Increasing the allowable U

235

 enrichment will have no influence on the probability of an accident previously evaluated. No changes will be made
to any safety related equipment, systems, or setpoints used in determining the probability of an evaluated accident.
Neither will the proposed amendment allow operation of the facility or safety equipment outside applicable limitations
or restrictions. Plant design bases will not be altered. With respect to the Fuel Handling Accident, the manner in
which the fuel is handled will not be altered. The heat load on the Spent Fuel Pool will not be increased and the cooling
and circulation systems and equipment will be unaltered. Therefore, there will be no significant increase in the
probability of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not increase maximum allowable burnup or fission product inventory. Since fission product
inventory is an inconsequential function of enrichment, radiological consequences evaluated in the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) will not increase. The proposed change will not alter the function of safety related
equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident previously evaluated or allow operation of the facility
outside applicable limitations or restrictions. Accordingly the proposed change will not involve a significant
increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed increase in allowable enrichment will not result in any design, operation, or function changes
to any safety related equipment designed to prevent and/or mitigate accidents, to any setpoints or systems, or to
any portion of the plant design basis. Operation of the facility will remain within all required limitations and restrictions.
With respect to the Fuel Handling Accident, the manner in which the fuel is handled will not be altered. The heat load
on the Spent Fuel Pool will not be increased and the cooling and circulation systems and equipment will be unaltered.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. NRC acceptance criteria
and thus the acceptable margin of safety to criticality for the Spent Fuel Pool and New Fuel Storage Vault criticality
are defined in Section 5.0 of the Technical Specifications. For the Spent Fuel Pool the criteria specify that Keff
must be maintained less than 0.95 when the pit is flooded with unborated water. For the New Fuel Storage Vault, the Keff
must remain less than 0.95 if the vault is flooded with unborated water, and must remain below 0.98 in an optimum moderation
event. Analyses performed in support of the proposed change demonstrate that these acceptance criteria will continue
to be met. With respect to radiological consequences, the margin of safety is defined by 10 CFR [Part] 100 limits which
will not be challenged. The analyses conclude that fission product inventory and thus radiological consequences
reported in Chapter 15 of the UFSAR will not change. Accordingly the proposed license amendment will not involve a
significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 29, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would allow operation of the plant with one Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) inoperable without entering
a condition prohibited by Section 3.0 of the Technical Specifications (TS). This TS request includes provisions
to avoid testing the operable EDG altogether under certain conditions to ensure that one EDG is available to provide
emergency power, if needed, and to preserve the EDG overall life and reliability.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change involves changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable,
as well as provision of additional measures to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change
will also avoid testing of an EDG when one EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common
cause. Since the changes involve the EDGs which perform an accident mitigation function and are not involved in any
accident initiation sequence, there is no significant increase in the probability of a previously analyzed accident.
Since the changes involve the EDGs which perform an accident mitigation function, and the changes provide additional
assurance that emergency power will be available for accident mitigation, [there] is no significant increase in
the consequences of a previously analyzed accident. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable, as
well as provision of additional measures to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change
will also avoid testing of an EDG when one EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common
cause. Since these changes do not involve changes in the operation of the plant, or physical or equipment changes and
involve controls for accident mitigation equipment, the proposed amendment will not created the possibility of
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes do not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change involves
changes in the testing frequency of the EDGs when one EDG is inoperable, as well as provision of additional measures
to ensure that a source of off-site power is available. The proposed change will also avoid testing of an EDG when one
EDG is inoperable if the EDG became inoperable for reasons other than a common cause. The change reduces the required
testing frequency of an operable EDG, hence reducing time that no EDG will be available for automatic starting and
loading. These changes will provide assurance that emergency power will be available to mitigate the effects of any
accident and will prevent excessive wear on the EDGs. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

Date of amendment request: 

August 1, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications to incorporate a 1.0 volt steam generator tube
interim plugging criteria (IPC) for Unit 1 beginning with Cycle 7, which will begin in the fall of 1994. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

Consistent with Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.121, ``Basis for Plugging Degraded PWR Steam Generator Tubes, '' Revision
0, August 1976, the traditional depth-based criteria for SG tube repair implicitly ensures that tubes accepted for
continued service will retain adequate structural and leakage integrity during normal operating, transient, and
postulated accident conditions. It is recognized that defects in tubes permitted to remain in service, especially
cracks, occasionally grow entirely through-wall and develop small leaks. Limits on allowable primary-to-secondary
leakage established in Technical Specifications ensure timely plant shutdown before the structural and leakage
integrity of the affected tube is challenged. 

The proposed license amendment request to implement voltage amplitude SG tube support plate Interim Plugging Criteria
for Byron Unit 1 meets the requirements of RG 1.121. The IPC methodology demonstrates that tube leakage is acceptably
low and tube burst is a highly improbable event during either normal operation or the most limiting accident condition,
a postulated main steam line break (MSLB) event. 

Adequate SG tube leakage integrity during normal operating conditions is assured by limiting allowable primary-to-secondary
leakage to 150 gpd per SG or 600 gpd total. Currently, this limit is administratively controlled. However, a license
amendment request was submitted on 06/03/94 to incorporate this limit into the Byron Technical Specifications.
During normal operating conditions, the tube support plate constrains the [outer diameter stress corrosion cracking]
ODSCC affected area of the tube to provide additional strength that precludes burst. Any leakage of a tube exhibiting
ODSCC at the [tube support plate] TSP is fully bounded by the existing SG tube rupture analysis included in the Byron
UFSAR. Therefore, probability of failure of a tube left in service or consequences of tube failure during normal operating
conditions is not significantly increased by the application of IPC. 
During transients, the TSP is conservatively assumed to displace due to the thermal-hydraulic loads associated
with the transient. This may partially expose a crack which is within the boundary of the TSP during normal operations
to free span conditions. Burst is therefore conservatively evaluated assuming the crack is fully exposed to free
span conditions. The structural eddy current bobbin coil voltage limit for free-span burst is 4.54 volts. This limit
takes into consideration a 1.43 safety factor applied to the steam line break differential pressure that is consistent
with RG 1.121 requirements. With additional considerations for growth rate assumptions and an upper 95% confidence
estimate on voltage variability, the maximum voltage indication that could remain in service is reduced to 2.7 volts.
For added conservatism, the allowable indication voltage is further reduced in the proposed amendment to a 1.0 volt
confirmed ODSCC indication limit. All indications between 1.0 and 2.7 volts will be subject to an RPC examination.
Tubes with RPC confirmed ODSCC indications will be plugged or sleeved. Any ODSCC indications between 1.0 volt and
2.7 volts which are not confirmed as ODSCC will be allowed to remain in service since these indications are not as likely
to affect tube structural integrity or leakage integrity over the next operating cycle as the indications that are
detectable by both bobbin and [rotating pancake coil] RPC inspections. 

The eddy current inspection process has been enhanced to address RG 1.83, ``Inservice Inspection of PWR Steam Generator
Tubes,'' Revision 1, July 1975, considerations as well as the EPRI SG Inspection Guidelines. Enhancements in accordance
with NUREG-1477 and Appendix A of the Catawba IPC report (WCAP-13698) are in place to increase detection of ODSCC indications
and to ensure reliable, consistent acquisition and analysis of data. Based on the conservative selection of the voltage
criteria and the increased ability to identify ODSCC, the probability of tube failure during an accident is also not
significantly increased due to application of requested IPC. 
 
For consistency with current offsite dose limits, the site allowable leakage limit during a MSLB has been conservatively
calculated to be 12.8 gpm. This leakage limit includes maximum allowable operational leakage from the unaffected
SGs and the accident leakage from the affected SG. As a requirement for operation following application of IPC, the
projected distribution of crack indications over the operating period must be verified to result in primary to secondary
accident leakage less than the site allowable leakage limit. Thus, the consequences of a MSLB remain unchanged. 

Therefore, as implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC for Byron Unit 1 does not adversely affect steam generator tube integrity
and results in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed license amendment request does not result in any significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Byron Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report. 

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

Implementation of the proposed SG tube IPC does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use
of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident outside the tube support plate elevations
since industry experience indicates that ODSCC originating within the tube support plate does not extend significantly
beyond the thickness of the support plate. This criteria only applies to ODSCC contained within the region of the tube
bounded by the tube support plate. 

In addressing the combined effects of Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) coincident with a Safe Shutdown Earthquake
(SSE) on the SG (as required by General Design Criteria 2), it has been determined that tube collapse of select tubes
may occur in the SGs at some plants, including Byron Unit 1. There are two issues associated with SG tube collapse. First,
the collapse of SG tubing reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance
to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase Peak Clad Temperature (PCT). Second,
there is a potential that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube
deformation or collapse. 

A number of tubes have been identified, in the ``wedge'' locations of the SG TSPs, that demonstrate the potential for
tube collapse during a LOCA + SSE event. Because of this potential, these tubes have been excluded from application
of the voltage-based SG TSP IPC. 

Therefore, neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which IPC has been
applied. 
ComEd has implemented a maximum primary to secondary leakage limit of 150 gpd through any one SG at Byron to help preclude
the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit provides for leakage detection
and plant shutdown in the event of an unexpected single crack leak associated with the longest permissible free span
crack length. The 150 gpd limit provides adequate leakage detection and plant shutdown criteria in the event an unexpected
single crack results in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube
burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the
crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude
tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides a conservative limit to prompt plant shutdown prior
to reaching critical crack lengths under MSLB conditions.

Upon implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC, steam generator tube integrity continues to be maintained through inservice
inspection and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated is not created. 

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The use of the voltage based bobbin coil probe SG TSP IPC for Byron Unit 1 will maintain steam generator tube integrity
commensurate with the criteria of RG 1.121 as discussed above. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the
worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube
rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations
result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage during all plant conditions and radiological consequences
are not adversely impacted by the application of IPC. 

The installation of SG tube plugs and sleeves reduces the RCS flow margin. As noted previously, implementation of
the SG TSP IPC will decrease the number of tubes which must be repaired by plugging or sleeving. Thus, implementation
of IPC will retain additional flow margin that would otherwise be reduced due to increased tube plugging. Therefore,
no significant reduction in the margin of safety will occur as a result of the implementation of this proposed license
amendment request. 

Although not relied upon to prove adequacy of the proposed amendment request, the following analyses demonstrate
that significant conservatisms exist in the methods and justifications described above: 

LIMITED TUBE SUPPORT PLATE DISPLACEMENT

An analysis was performed to verify [the effect] of limited TSP displacement during accident conditions (MSLB).
Application of minimum TSP displacement assumptions reduce the likelihood of a tube burst to negligible levels.
Consideration of limited TSP displacement would also reduce potential MSLB leakage when compared to the leakage
calculated assuming free span indications. 

PROBABILITY OF DETECTION

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Performance Demonstration Program analyzed the performance of approximately
20 eddy current data analysts evaluating data from a unit with 3/4'' inside diameter and 0.049'' wall thickness tubes.
The results of this analysis clearly show that the detectability of larger voltage indications is increased which
lends creditability for application of a POD of > 0.62 for ODSCC indications larger than 1.0 volt. 
 
RISK EVALUATION OF CORE DAMAGE

As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Byron Unit 1 Cycle 7, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency under containment bypass conditions, with and without the
interim plugging criteria applied at Byron Unit 1. 

The total Byron core damage frequency is estimated to be 3.09E-5 per reactor year with a total contribution from containment
bypass sequences of 3.72E-8 per reactor year according to the results of the current individual plant evaluation
(IPE). Operation with the requested IPC resulted in an insignificant increase in core damage frequency resulting
from MSLB with containment bypass conditions. 

Therefore, based on the evaluation above, ComEd has concluded that this proposed license amendment request does
not involve a significant hazards consideration. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 8, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would add a License Condition to specify that commitments made in response to the March 14,
1983, NUREG-0737 Order shall be maintained pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed:

Commonwealth Edison has addressed all issues made in response to NUREG-0737. As such, the purpose of the post-TMI
Order is no longer served. The inclusion of the modified Order as a license condition is administrative in nature and
does not allow unregulated decreases in the level of safety; therefore, this license amendment is appropriate and
safe. The proposed license amendment requires control of NUREG-0737 commitments through 10 CFR 50.59. If an unreviewed
safety question occurs during the review of a NUREG 0737 item then Commonwealth Edison is obligated to submit a change
to the NRC staff as a license amendment. As a result of the proposed amendment, there are no physical changes to the facility
and all operating procedures, limiting conditions for operation (LCO), limiting safety system settings, and safety
limits specified in the Technical Specifications will remain unchanged. Therefore, the proposed license amendment
to modify the post-TMI Order will not increase the probability or the consequences of any accident previously analyzed.

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated:

Since there are no changes in the way the plant is operated, the potential for a new or different kind of accident is not
created. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not affect any accident initiators for Dresden,
Quad Cities, and Zion Stations. No new failure modes are introduced.

Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:

Plant safety margins are established through LCOs, limiting safety system settings, and safety limits specified
in the Technical Specifications. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will be no changes to either the physical
design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits. The proposed changes are administrative and do not affect
the safe operation of the sites. Therefore, there will be no changes to any of the margins of safety.

Guidance has been provided in 51 FR 7744 for the application of standards to license change requests for determination
of the existence of significant hazards considerations. This document provides examples of amendments which are
not likely considered to involve significant hazards considerations.
 
This proposed amendment does not involve a significant relaxation of the criteria used to establish safety limits,
a significant relaxation of the bases for the limiting safety system setting or a significant relaxation of the bases
for the limiting conditions for operations. The proposed changes are administrative in nature without consequence
to the safety of the plant. Therefore, based on the guidance provided in the Federal Register and the criteria established
in 10 CFR 50.92(c), the proposed change does not constitute a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

County, Connecticut 




Date of amendment request: 

June 30, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would modify the Administrative Controls Section of the Technical Specifications by replacing
the present Nuclear Review Board (NRB) for the Haddam Neck Plant, and the NRB and Site Nuclear Review Board (SNRB) with
a Nuclear Safety Assessment Board (NSAB) which will serve Millstone Units 1, 2, and 3, and Haddam Neck.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below:



... These proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The NSAB is an oversight group which provides independent assessments of activities at the Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone
Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The members of the NSAB are appointed by the Executive Vice President - Nuclear to provide oversight
and feedback on the operation of the units. The NSAB adds to the defense-in-depth provided by the design, operation,
maintenance, and quality oversight of the nuclear units by promoting excellence through the conduct of its affairs
and advising the Executive Vice President - Nuclear in matters concerning nuclear safety.

The proposed modification to the Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and will establish a new
group which will accomplish the guidance provided in ANSI N18.7-1976. The charter of the NSAB will be controlled by
procedure. 
These administrative changes will not increase the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed addition of the NSAB and its subcommittees and the ensuing elimination of the NRB and the SNRB is an administrative
reorganization. There are no changes in the way in which the plants are physically operated. The administrative changes
being accomplished by the establishment of the NSAB fulfills the function previously provided by the NRB and the SNRB.
The organization of the NSAB will follow the guidance found in ANSI N18.7-1976 and will be controlled by procedure.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes establish the requirements of the NSAB. The NSAB replaces those activities previously performed
by the NRB and the SNRB. With these changes the new organization will provide more consistent and clearer feedback
to the four units and the Executive Vice President - Nuclear.

The changes do not directly affect any protective boundaries nor do they impact the safety limits for the protective
boundaries. These proposed changes are administrative in nature. Therefore, there can be no reduction in the margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Section 6.5.1, Station Nuclear Safety Committee (SNSC),
to change the designation of the Chairman and to clarify the maximum allowable alternate members for quorum purposes.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

This is an administrative change. Since this change maintains a consistent level of chairmanship while continuing
to ensure independence and technical expertise of the SNSC chairman, this change does not increase the probability
or consequences of an accident.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.

This is an administrative change of the designation of the Chairman of SNSC which does not significantly decrease
the level of senior management which is responsible for chairing SNSC. No new or different kind of accident has been
created.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 
The independence and technical expertise of the SNSC Chairman will be preserved. SNSC will continue to be composed
of those individuals most related to matters of nuclear safety. The margin of safety will not be reduced by this change.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant

Date of amendment request: 

May 24, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would transfer the boron concentration in Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.1 for the reactor
coolant system and the refueling canal during MODE 6, and the boron concentration in TS 4.7.13.3 for the spent fuel
pool from the TS to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The application is submitted in response to the guidance
in Generic Letter 88-16 which addresses the transfer of fuel cycle-specific parameter limits from the TS to the COLR.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The following analysis, performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91, shows that the proposed amendment will not create a significant
hazards consideration as defined by the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92.

1. This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.

No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The relocation of boron concentration values to the COLR is an administrative
change which will have no effect on the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed accident. The required
values of boron concentration will continue to be determined through use of approved methodologies.

2. This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.

No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The administrative change of relocating parameters to the COLR, in this case boron concentration, cannot
create the probability of an accident.

3. This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Required boron concentrations will remain appropriate for each cycle, and will continue to be calculated using approved
methodologies. There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

February 5, 1993 as supplemented by letter dated August 1, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to incorporate a technical review and control
process to supplement the onsite technical review and approval of new procedures and changes thereto affecting nuclear
safety. This process is discussed in Section 5.5 of the Revised Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1432.
This notice supersedes the notice issued on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19478), and acknowledges the clarification in the
licensee's 
August 1, 1994, letter.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change is administrative in nature and provides for 1) procedural reviews through the use of qualified
technical review personnel designated by the PORC [Plant Operating Review Committee] and 2) procedural approval
through the use of group heads designated by the General Manager Plant Operations as authorized by administrative
controls upon their development. As part of this process, qualified technical reviewers will be individuals other
than the preparer who will document and implement necessary cross-discipline reviews prior to approval. The process
will be controlled by administrative controls which will be reviewed by the PORC and approved by the General Manager
Plant Operations.

The procedures governing plant operation will continue to ensure that plant parameters are maintained within acceptable
limits. Procedures and changes thereto will be reviewed and approved at a level commensurate with their importance
to safety. Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes do not involve physical changes to the plant,
changes to setpoints, or operating parameters. The applicable procedures governing the operation of the plant will
receive reviews and approvals commensurate with their importance to nuclear safety, and where appropriate cross-discipline
review will be performed. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature. The Waterford 3 safety margins are defined and maintained by the
Technical Specifications in Sections 2-5 which are unaffected. Therefore, the proposed change will not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The licensee's letter dated August 1, 1994, provided a clarification of the proposed wording of the technical specifications
to assure the personnel performing the technical reviews would have the necessary technical knowledge base.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would move the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.3.4 Turbine Overspeed Protection
from the technical specifications (TS) and relocate them in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) consistent
with the NRC Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change relocates the Turbine Valve Overspeed Protection requirements from the TS to the Waterford 3
UFSAR consistent with the NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements. Testing and inspections
of the turbine Overspeed Protection System will remain governed by an approved turbine maintenance program, described
in the UFSAR. This proposed change has no affect on the current Turbine Overspeed Protection requirements other then
to relocate them to the UFSAR. Thus, the probability of a turbine missile causing damage to a safety-related component
or structure at Waterford 3 as described in the FSAR analysis (Reference 5) is not affected. The purpose of the Turbine
Overspeed Protection System is to prevent an overspeed event, the precursor to a potential turbine fragment missile.
Since the purpose of this system is preventive, it serves no function to mitigate any accident previously evaluated.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment.
No new failure modes or limiting failures have been identified as result of the proposed change. The proposed change
will not alte the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated. Any subsequent change to the Turbine Oversspeed
Protection System requirements will undergo a review in accordance with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to ensure that
the change does not involve an unreviewed safety question.

Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
prveiously evaluated.

The proposed change will relocate Turbine Overspeed Protection System requirements from the TS to the Waterford
3 UFSAR on the basis that the Turbine Overspeed Protection System does not meet the criteria of the NRC Final Policy
Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Reactors. The requirements that will reside in
the UFSAR for the Turbine Overspeed Protection system will ensure that the system remains capable of protecting the
turbine from excessive overspeed. The proposed change will have no adverse impact on any protective boundary or safety
limit.

Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments evise various Technical Specification sections to implement enhancements recommended
by NRC Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation,'' for St. Lucie Units 1 and 2.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The standards used to arrive at a determination that a request for amendment involves a no significant hazards consideration
are included in the Commission's regulation, 10 CFR 50.92. 10 CFR 50.92 states that no significant hazards considerations
are involved if the operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:

(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendments do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed amendments conform to the guidance given in Enclosure 1 of the NRC Generic Letter 93-05.
The overall functional capabilities of the incore detector system, reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves,
safety injection tank, or containment sump will not be modified by the proposed change. Therefore, the probability
or consequences of an accident are not significantly increased by the changes.

(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.

The use of the modified specifications can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since the proposed amendments will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation
defined in the facility operating license. No new failure mode is introduced due to the surveillance interval changes
and clarifications, since the proposed changes do not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor do they
alter the design or operation of affected plant systems.

(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The operating limits and functional capabilities of the affected systems are unchanged by the proposed amendments.
Therefore, the modified specifications which establish new or clarify old surveillance intervals consistent with
the NRC Generic Letter 93-05 line-item improvement guidance do not significantly reduce any of the margins of safety.

Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendments do not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
do not involve a significant hazards consideration. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

The amendment will upgrade Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.1.6 for the Main Feedwater Line Isolation Valves
to be consistent with NUREG-1432, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering Plants.'' The
changes include all related requirements of NUREG-1432, Revision O, specification 3.7.3. Accordingly, the proposal
is consistent with the Commission's Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements (58 FR 39132).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:

(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment will upgrade the existing Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) associated with the Main
Feedwater Line Isolation Valves (MFIVs) to be consistent with NUREG-1432, Standard Technical Specifications for
Combustion Engineering Plants. The MFIVs are not initiators of accidents previously evaluated, but are included
as part of the success paths associated with mitigating various accidents and transients. The redundancy afforded
by two MFIVs per feedwater line in conjunction with the requirements of the proposed LCO assure that the feedwater
isolation safety function of these valves can be accomplished considering single failure criteria. Neither the
feedwater system design nor the safety function of the MFIVs have been altered from those previously evaluated, and
the proposed amendment does not change the applicable plant safety analyses.

Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes are administrative in nature in that they do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification
of existing equipment, nor do they otherwise alter the design of St. Lucie Unit 2 systems. Therefore, operation of
the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The safety function of the MFIVs is to terminate main feedwater flow and isolate the safety related portion from the
non-safety related portion of the feedwater system. The proposed amendment, in conjunction with the redundancy
afforded by the feedwater system design, assures that this safety function can be accomplished considering single-failure
criteria. The bases for required actions and the action completion times specified for inoperable MFIVs is consistent
with the corresponding specifications in NUREG-1432, which are equally applicable to St. Lucie Unit 2. The safety
analyses for applicable accidents and transients remain unchanged from those previously evaluated and reported
in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed
amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded
that this proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specification Table 4.3-1, Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Surveillance
Requirements, Technical Specification 3.3.4, Turbine Governor Valves and Technical Specification 3.7.1.2, Turbine
Driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pump. The purpose of this amendment is to remove one-time amendments that are no longer
necessary. In addition, six minor editorial changes are proposed.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident.

The changes proposed to remove the one-time amendments return the Technical Specifications to the exact wording
prior to the one-time amendments. Returning the Technical Specifications to their original wording is administrative
because the one-time amendments are no longer applicable. Hence, removing the one-time amendments would not increase
the probability or consequences of an accident. The other changes are purely editorial in nature, hence, would not
increase the probability or consequences of an accident. Based on the above, removal of the one-time amendments from
the Technical Specifications will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The changes proposed to remove the one-time amendments return the Technical Specifications to the exact wording
prior to the one-time amendments. Returning the Technical Specifications to their original wording is administrative

Date of amendment request: 

July 12, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment changes the requirement to perform the surveillance test for the channel functional test
Rod Block Monitor, Flow-biased Average Power Range Monitor and Recirculation Flow instruments from within 24 hours
prior to startup to after the reactor is in the RUN mode, but prior to when each system is assumed to function in the plant
safety analysis. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1) The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the RBM will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences for any previously-evaluated event as we are only matching the mode requirements for performing
the SR to the OPERABILITY requirement for the RBM system, i.e., prior to 30% RTP. The system will be verified to be OPERABLE
prior to when it is assumed to be OPERABLE in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) for the DAEC.

Allowing the Channel Functional Test for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block Upscale and Downscale trips to be performed
``within 24 hours of entering RUN mode and prior to exceeding 25% RTP'' will not increase either the probability or
consequences of any previously-analyzed event. The applicable event for the rod block function during reactor startup
is a control Rod Withdrawal Error (RWE), which is initiated by either an operator error or malfunction within the Reactor
Manual Control System, not by a malfunction within the APRM system. However, a RWE event that could challenge the fuel
thermal limits is precluded because, as documented in the DAEC UFSAR (see Section 15.4) and the analysis submitted
to support DAEC TS Amendment No. 120,( NEDC-30813-P, 

Average Power Range Monitor, Rod Block Monitor and Technical Specification Improvement (ARTS) Program for the Duane
Arnold Energy Center,

 December 1984.), significant margin exists below 25% RTP to assure the Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power Ratio
(SLMCPR) is not violated by a RWE event. In addition, rod pattern controls are in place during this period to limit the
rod withdrawal sequence, i.e., rod worth, such that the fuel thermal limits would not be exceeded. The Control Rod
Drop Accident is unaffected by the requested SR change as the ``accident'' control rod is assumed to be de-coupled
from its drive mechanism and free-falls from fully inserted to fully-withdrawal. As the drive for that rod is assumed
to be fully-withdrawn as an initial condition in the event, the APRM rod block has no role in either preventing or mitigating
the rod drop accident. Thus, revising the SR for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block has no impact upon the Control Rod Drop
Accident.

The SRs for the Recirculation Flow Rod Block trips are being modified for consistency with the APRM Rod Block changes
above, as the sole purpose of this Recirculation Flow signal is to provide the flow input signal into the APRM Flow-Biased
trips. The Recirculation Flow units are a support system to the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Blocks. There is no event that
is either caused by or mitigated by the Recirculation Flow Rod Block trips. They are provided solely to ensure that
if the flow signal being input into the APRM circuits is not valid, a precautionary rod block will be generated as the
APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block setpoint could be in error. Consequently, allowing the Channel Functional Test for the
Recirculation Flow Rod Block Upscale, Downscale and Comparator trips to be performed ``within 24 hours of entering
RUN mode and prior to exceeding 25% RTP'' will not increase either the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed
event as these rod blocks are not involved in either preventing or mitigating any analyzed event.

2) The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the RBM will not introduce any new or different
event, as no changes in system design or operation are being made. We are only matching the requirement for performing
the SR to the OPERABILITY requirement for the RBM system.

The proposed change to the Channel Functional Test frequency for the APRM and Recirculation Flow Rod Blocks will not
introduce any new or different event, as no changes in either system design or operation are being made. In fact, by
allowing the Channel Functional Test to be performed in an operating state which does not require extensive use of
jumpers and/or relay blocks, we reduce the possibility of an error being made that could cause an inadvertent actuation
of an ESF or disabling of an ESF.

3) The proposed change matches the mode requirement for performing the SR to the OPERABILITY requirement for the RBM
system, 

i.e.

, prior to 30% RTP. The system will be verified to be OPERABLE prior to when it is assumed to be OPERABLE in the UFSAR accident
analysis. Thus, the margin of safety for the RBM is not reduced.

As stated in the BASES for TS Chapter 3/4.2, the margin of safety for the APRM rod block is to prevent violation of the
SLMCPR in RUN by a RWE event. The analysis of the RWE event during Startup (See DAEC UFSAR Section 15.4.2) and during
Power Operation (Ibid), demonstrates that violations of the SLMCPR are not possible in RUN below 25% RTP when normal
control rod patterns are followed (which are reinforced by procedural and/or automatic rod pattern controls). Because
the proposed change to the SR for the APRM Flow-Biased Rod Block will still ensure that the trip will be OPERABLE prior
to exceeding 25% RTP, this change will not reduce the existing margin of safety.

Again, the Recirculation Flow units are a support system to the APRM flow-biased circuits. The Recirculation Flow
Rod Blocks are merely precautionary, they do not prevent or mitigate any accident. Therefore, the proposed revision
to the Recirculation Flow Rod block SR frequency will not reduce the margin of safety for the same reasons given above
for the APRM Rod Blocks.

Date of amendment request: 

July 29, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by allowing the processing and implementation
of an ISI or IST request for relief from the ASME Code under 10 CFR 50.59 without prior NRC approval, provided that the
relief request has been reviewed and approved by the plant staff and plant safety committee.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve any increase in the probability
of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs,
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a, are described in the Technical Specifications. The proposed amendment, in accordance
with NUREG-1433 and draft NUREG-1482, permits relief from an ASME Code requirement in the interim between the time
of submittal of a relief request and NRC approval of the relief. The changes being proposed do not affect assumptions
contained in plant safety analyses or change the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do they affect
Technical Specifications that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Any relief from the approved ASME Section
XI Code requirements that is implemented prior to NRC review and approval will require evaluation under the 10 CFR
50.59 process to determine that no TS changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. This evaluation process will
ensure that the impact of any Code relief is thoroughly evaluated and that the structures, systems and components
remain in conformance with assumptions made in the safety analysis. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not affect the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs,
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a, are described in the Technical Specifications. The proposed amendment, in accordance
with NUREG-1433 and draft NUREG-1482, permits relief from an ASME Code requirement in the interim between the time
of submittal of a relief request and NRC approval of the relief. The changes being proposed will not change the physical
plant or the modes of operation defined in the Facility License. The changes do not involve the addition or modification
of equipment nor do they alter the design or operation of plant systems. Any relief from the approved ASME Section XI
Code requirements that is implemented prior to NRC review and approval will require evaluation under the 10 CFR 50.59
process to determine that no TS changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. This evaluation process will ensure
that the impact on any Code relief is thoroughly evaluated and that the structures, systems and components remain
in conformance with assumptions made in the safety analysis. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated.

3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve any reduction in a margin
of safety. The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a, are described in the Technical
Specifications. The proposed amendment, in accordance with NUREG-1433 and draft NUREG-1482, permits relief from
an ASME Code requirement in the interim between the time of submittal of a relief request and NRC approval of the relief.
The changes being proposed do not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly
or the basis for any TS that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a safety margin. Any relief from the
approved ASME Section XI Code equirements that is implemented prior to NRC review and approval will require evaluation
under the 10 CFR 50.59 process to determine that no TS changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. This evaluation
process will ensure that the impact on any Code relief does not affect the ability of structures, systems or components
to perform their design function, affect compliance with any TS requirements or reduce the margin of safety. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Date of amendment request: 

July 26, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the existing limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.12.A.2.c to allow for
increased flow capacity of the control room emergency filter system. By increasing the maximum allowed makeup capacity
of this system, additional margin is provided for the positive pressurization of the control room envelope. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?



Evaluation

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of < 1000 CFM. By establishing a new maximum flowrate for this
system, additional filtered makeup air can be supplied to the Control Room, thus increasing the positive pressure
in the Control Room envelope. 

The purpose ofthe Control Room Emergency Filter System is to remove radioactive iodine and other radioactive materials
from the makeup air during design basis accidents. Therefore, any change to this system will not increase the probability
of an accident previously evaluated. Radiological calculations show that the increased flowrate of this system
will not result in a significant increase in Control Room operator dose during a design basis accidents, and these
doses remain well below the established limits. Therefore, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated
are not significantly increased. The addition of the new Surveillance Requirement provides a Technical Specification
required periodic demonstration of the positive pressurization function of the system. This requirement has previously
been implemented per existing surveillance procedures as part of the overall Control Room Emergency Filter System
operability demonstration, and does not represent a new requirement. This proposed change does not introduce any
new modes of plant operation nor affect any operational setpoints. The change does not degrade the performance of
any safety system assumed to function in the accident analysis. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
 
2. Does the proposed change create the possibility for a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?

Evaluation

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of < 1000 CFM. This proposed change involves a physical modification
to the Control Room Emergency Filter System where the filter fan is replaced with a new fan with greater capacity. To
accommodate the additional flow capacity of the system, an additional charcoal tray is installed in the charcoal
adsorber unit. The District has evaluated the potential effects of this modification and has determined that the
increased air flowrate is within the system capacity and that radiological doses, through the filter system, during
the design basis accident are largely unaffected. Because this is a modification of an existing system with no direct
interface with other systems responsible for prohibiting or mitigating design basis events, the District has concluded
that this proposed change cannot create the possibility for a new or different kind of accident. This proposed change
does not involve the creation, deletion, or modification of the function of any structure or system, except as described
above, nor does this change introduce or change any mode of plant operation. This proposed change does not create the
possibility for a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does the proposed change create a significant reduction in the margin of safety?

Evaluation

This license amendment request involves the upgrading of the Control Room Emergency Filter System from 341 cubic
feet per minute (CFM) plus or minus 10% to a maximum of < 1000 CFM. By establishing this new maximum flowrate for the
Emergency Filter System, additional filtered makeup air can be supplied to the Control Room envelope, thus improving
the margin for positive pressurization with respect to adjacent areas. Recent tests, utilizing the Main Control
Room Air Conditioning System, have provided information that supports an increase in the Emergency Filter System
flowrate, from 341 CFM to the proposed maximum system capability of approximately 1000 CFM. These tests indicate
that an increase of positive pressure can be achieved by this increased flowrate. This positive pressure increase
provides additional margin of Control Room envelope positive pressure.

The District has performed radiological calculations to determine the increase in Control Room operator dose during
the 30-day design basis LOCA event, as a result of increased system air flow. These calculations show increasing the
Control Room Emergency Filter System to a maximum of 1000 CFM results in a dose of 1.799 Rem whole body and 12.81 Rem thyroid.
These doses are not significantly different than the doses received at a system flowrate of 341 CFM, which is 1.745
Rem whole body and 11.39 Rem thyroid. These doses are well within the limits of 10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General
Design Criteria 19, and the guidance provided in NUREG 0800, which require that doses be limited to less than 5 Rem whole
body, or its equivalent to any part of the body including 30 Rem thyroid, for the duration of any design basis accident.
The above calculated values have also been evaluated and determined to be within the Updated Safety Analysis Report
(USAR) Section XII requirement of 0.5 Rem in any eight-hour period, whole body from the reactor building. Increasing
the Control Room Emergency Filter System maximum flowrate has a minimal effect on quantifiable dose rates, while
increasing positive pressurization in the Control Room envelope. By increasing the positive pressurization in
the Control Room envelope, the possibility of non quantifiable radiation dose to the Control Room operators, through
inleakage, is reduced. This proposed change does not involve any change to instrument setpoints or operation. Therefore,
the District has concluded that this proposed change does not create a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

York 




Date of amendment request: 

July 21, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 2.2.2 (Reactor Coolant System), 3.2.8/4.2.8
(Pressure Relief Systems - Safety Valves), and the associated Bases to reduce the number of reactor head safety valves
required operable from 16 valves to 9 valves. The Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (NMP1) reactor vessel was
designed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code), Section I-1962
and Code Case 1271N. In order to show compliance with the ASME Code, it was assumed that a main steam isolation valve
(MSIV) closure occurred without scram. This assumption demonstrated that it was necessary to have 16 reactor head
safety valves. However, the licensee now states that Section 5.2.2.II.A of NUREG-0800 (Standard Review Plan) requires
that safety valves shall be designed with sufficient capacity to limit the pressure to less than 110 percent of the
reactor coolant system design pressure during the most severe abnormal operational transient with credit for reactor
scram. The licensee now proposes to use the high neutron flux scram in analyzing this event. The licensee states that
this results in a reduction in the number of safety valves required operable from 16 valves to 9 valves. The setpoints
of the valve groups would remain unchanged. Testing of the safety valves for setpoint and partial lift would be changed
to be in accordance with the NMP1 Inservice Test Program which is based upon ASME Code, Section XI, 1983, including
Summer Addenda.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes reduce the number of safety valves from sixteen (16) to nine (9). The function of the safety valves
is to provide code overpressure protection. This design basis event has been reanalyzed using the methodology documented
in NEDE-24011-P-A, General Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel (GESTAR). The reanalysis takes credit
for the high neutron flux scram in order to reduce the number of valves. Since peak pressure remains below the safety
limit, the consequences of the event remain the same. The resultant peak pressure is below the pressure safety limit
of 1375 psig. The only event initiator that involves safety valves is the spurious actuation of one valve. Since the
number of valves has been reduced, the probability of a spurious actuation has been reduced. Testing in accordance
with ASME Section XI will ensure that the safety valves lift at the required setpoints although the frequency of testing
has been reduced. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change represents physical changes to the plant as described in the NMP1 Final Safety Analysis Report
(Updated). The proposed changes however, do not alter the method of providing overpressure protection, i.e., safety
valves. The valves continue to function to limit peak pressure below the safety limit. Therefore, maintaining reactor
vessel integrity. The reduction in number of safety valves results from taking credit for the high neutron flux scram
in the safety valve actuation transient as allowed by NUREG-0800. The initiating event, MSIV closure, remains unchanged.
Although the frequency of testing has been reduced, testing in accordance with the requirements of Section XI of the
ASME Code will ensure valves lift at the required setpoints. Thus, no potential initiating events are created which
would cause any new or different kinds of accidents. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with
the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

The overpressure safety limit of 1375 psig remains unchanged. In addition to the initial conditions associated with
the safety valve actuation transient, NUREG-0800 allows the use of the high neutron flux scram. This results in the
reduction from sixteen (16) to nine (9) safety valves with peak pressure in the vessel still below the overpressure
safety limit. The margin of safety is defined as the range between the safety limit (1375 psig) and the failure point
of the vessel. Thus, since peak pressure is below the safety limit, the margin of safety has not been reduced. Additionally,
testing in accordance with ASME Section XI ensures operation at the required setpoints and does not result in reduction
with margin of safety. Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed change will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

July 21, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 2.1.2 (Fuel Cladding Integrity), 3.1.7 (Fuel
Rods), 3.4.6/4.6.2 (Protective Instrumentation), and the associated Bases to allow the use of Range 10 on the Intermediate
Range Neutron Flux Monitors (IRMs) with the Reactor Protection System (RPS) low pressure trip for main steam line
isolation valve closure not in bypass. Changes are also being proposed to TS Tables 3.6.2.a/4.6.2.a (Instrumentation
that Initiates Scram) and TS Tables 3.6.2.g/4.6.2.g (Instrumentation that Initiates Control Rod Withdrawal Block)
to extend the calibration frequency of the Source Range Neutron Flux Monitors (SRMs) and the IRMs from prior to startup
and shutdown to once per operating cycle. In addition, the proposed amendment would change the Instrument Channel
Test interval for the SRMs and IRMs from prior to startup and shutdown to once per week. The licensee stated that these
changes are in accordance with NUREG-1433 (Improved Standard Technical Specifications for BWR/4). Associated
changes to TS Setpoints, Bases, References, and Notes for TSs 2.1.2, 3.1.7, and 3.6.2/4.6.2 are also being proposed.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes expand the IRM operating range, deletes the coincident APRM [Average Power Range Monitor] downscale
scram trip and extend the calibration interval for the SRM/IRM System setpoints. The expansion of the startup operating
range is required to achieve the 1/2 decade overlap between the IRMs and the APRMs. Proper overlap improves plant safety
by ensuring a smooth transition between IRMs and APRMs. The evaluation of operation in IRM range 10 demonstrates that
the addition of range 10 along with the RPS low pressure isolation activated ensures that the fuel cladding integrity
safety limits would not be exceeded.

The increased IRM/APRM overlap reduces the probability of multiple APRM channels downscale in the transition between
the IRM and APRM Systems and thus eliminates the need for re-activation of the IRM scram when in the run mode. The scram
is replaced by an overlap surveillance which requires that the IRMs overlap by at least 1/2 decade with the APRMs during
normal shutdown. This surveillance ensures that the IRM/APRM overlap is maintained which is the basis for deletion
of the APRM downscale scram. With the improved overlap, the probability of multiple APRM channels being downscale
is reduced such that it is no longer a credible event and therefore, the APRM rod block in combination with proper operating
procedures, provides the same level of protection. Thus, normal plant operation is not affected by these changes
and the probability of previously analyzed accidents is not increased. 
The new surveillance intervals and setpoints were calculated using the General Electric approved methodology documented
in NEDC-31336. The methodology in NEDC-31336 provides assurance that safety system actuation (i.e., reactor scram
or control rod withdrawal block) will occur prior to the associated system parameter, neutron flux, from exceeding
its analytical limit. Thus, plant response to previously analyzed accidents remains within previously determined
limits.

Therefore, the operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposedamendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The addition of IRM range 10, deletion of the APRM downscale scram tripand extension of the surveillance interval
for the SRM/IRM instrumentation, does not involve an initiation or failure not considered in the Final Safety Analysis
Report (Updated). The proposed changes do not alter the plant configuration and the initial conditions used for the
design basis accident are still valid. Thus, no potential initiating events are created which would cause any new
or different kinds of accidents. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment,
will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The addition of IRM range 10 ensures sufficient overlap with the APRM System such that switching between startup and
run can be easily accomplished. The requirement for having the low reactor pressure isolation in effect when operating
in IRM range 10 is to prevent a potential depressurization event. Analysis has shown that the margin between the existing
safety limits and those events previously analyzed has not been reduced. The deletion of the coincident APRM scram
trip has also been shown not to result in a decrease in the margin of safety as the APRM downscale control rod withdrawal
block provides adequate protection. The analytical limits associated with the SRM/IRM instrumentation have been
reconstituted in conjunction with extending the surveillance interval to once per operating cycle. The results
using the methodology defined in NEDC-31336 required that various setpoints in the Technical Specifications be
changed, however, these changes do not reduce the margins between any existing safety limits and previously analyzed
events. Therefore, operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, Docket No. 50-245, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, New London County,
Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

June 23, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would reword Technical Specification 3.7, ``Containment Systems,'' to permit operation with
one of the two circuits of the reactor building ventilation logic temporarily inoperable. In addition, Section 3.7.C.1.b
will be reworded to not permit movement of irradiated fuel, or movement of any loads over irradiated fuel, without
secondary containment integrity.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

The function of a reactor building ventilation isolation is to limit fission product release in the event of a design
basis accident (DBA). Two dampers in series are provided in both the supply and exhaust lines of the reactor building
ventilation so that no single failure would result in the failure to isolate these secondary containment penetrations.
The proposed change permits one of the two circuits of the reactor building ventilation isolation logic to be temporarily
inoperable.

The Millstone Unit No. 1 DBAs that could be affected by the proposed LCO [Limiting Condition for Operation] are those
in which the secondary containment is credited to isolate and contain fission products. The probability of occurrence
of any of these accidents is not altered by changes to the operation of secondary containment. There is a small potential
increase in the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. This is due to the small increase in probability
that a release could occur while Millstone Unit No. 1 is operating in the proposed LCO.

The increase in public risk due to the proposed LCO is negligible. The associated increase in risk is similar to the
increase in public risk permitted by other LCOs. A PRA [probabilistic risk assessment] has determined that the probability
of an event with a radioactive release in the reactor building, concurrent with a failure of both operable ventilation
dampers to function, while in the 7-day LCO, is very small.

The wording change to Technical Specification 3.7.C.1.b would result in more conservative restrictions, in that
secondary containment integrity would be required when any load (e.g., new fuel) is being moved over irradiated fuel.
As currently written, the Technical Specification only requires secondary containment integrity when the fuel
cask or irradiated fuel is being moved. Therefore, qualitatively, this change would have a positive impact on the
probability and consequences of accidents involving spent fuel.

Based upon the above, the proposed changes do not constitute a significant increase in the probability or consequence
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed addition of a new LCO which allows operation with one circuit of the reactor building ventilation isolation
logic inoperable for up to seven days, would only affect the reliability of the secondary containment isolation.
No new equipment is being added, and no new type of operation is being introduced. This change allows a short (seven
day) period of operation when the reactor building ventilation is not single failure proof. The reactor building
ventilation functions to mitigate the consequences of accidents. Failure to function, therefore, does not create
the possibility of a different kind of accident.

The proposed change to Section 3.7.C.1.b increases the restrictions on load handling, thereby decreasing the possibility
of any kind of accident involving irradiated fuel.

Therefore, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes would permit temporary plant operation with a small decrease in the reliability of secondary
containment isolation. However, the reliability of the reactor building ventilation isolation would remain high
enough with the proposed LCO, that the impact on the protective boundaries and the margin of safety would be insignificant.

The proposed change to Section 3.7.C.1.b increases the restrictions on load handling, decreasing the possibility
of any kind of accident involving irradiated fuel. Therefore this change would not constitute a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50-423, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3, New London
County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

July 22, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications to (1) change the title of Figure 3.1-5 to be consistent
with the applicable Limiting Condition For Operation (LCO), (2) relocate the Chemical and Volume Control System
(CVCS) valve position requirements to the Reactivity Control Systems - Shutdown Margin specifications, and (3)
consolidate action statements to be expressed in the LCOs rather than in Surveillance Requirements, and also clarify
the requirements for calculating the heat flux hot channel factor F

Q

(z) when using the base load option.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



... The proposed changes would not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would
not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specification requirements and do
not substantively affect plant operation. Since they do not affect plant operations, they cannot be initiators of
any events.

The safety analysis of the plant is unaffected by the proposed changes. Since the safety analysis is unaffected, the
calculated radiological releases associated with the accident analyses are not affected. Therefore, the proposed
changes will not increase the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
As previously stated, the proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specifications
and do not substantively affect plant operation. No new failure modes are introduced. Since the proposed modifications
do not affect plant operations, they cannot be initiators of new events.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes are clarifications or relocation of existing technical specifications and are not substantive
changes. The correction of the title in Figure 3.1-5 will ensure consistency throughout the technical specifications.
The relocation of the CVCS valves requirements from the RCS [Reactor Coolant System] - Cold Shutdown Specification
to the Reactivity Control Systems - Shutdown Margin specification will ensure the CVCS valves requirements are located
in the most appropriate location and will help the operators from the commission of errors or omission of actions due
to inappropriately located material. The final change will revise the action statement sections of the specification
pertaining to heat flux hot channel factor to ensure all actions in these specifications are clearly displayed and
not contained in the corresponding surveillance requirements. Therefore, since these changes are editorial in
nature, the proposed modification will have no impact on the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-171, Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 1, York County, Pennsylvania








Date of Application for Amendment: 

May 9, 1994


Brief description of amendment: 

This Licensee Amendment Request (LAR) proposes to revise the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 1, Possession-Only
License and Technical Specifications (TS) to reflect the name change of Philadelphia Electric Company to PECO Energy
Company, to provide proper reference to 10 CFR Part 20 requirements (56 FR 23360), and to reduce the required frequency
for performing periodic inspections in the containment vessel below ground level for water accumulation. 








Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




a. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not alter the operation of equipment assumed to be an initiator or any analyzed
event or assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative
in nature. Proposed change 3 to reduce the required frequency for performing the periodic inspection for water accumulation
in the containment vessel below ground level does not impact the probability of ground water intrusion into the containment
building. Proposed change 3 maintains adequate assurance that integrity of the containment building with respect
to ground water entry will be maintained. The design of Unit 1 makes it very difficult for ground water to reach the exterior
of the containment liner to start the metal corrosion process. The concrete layer between the rock and the containment
liner serves as a barrier to prevent water migration to the liner shell. A cathodic protection system provides protective
current to the containment liner as well as nearby underground piping. The steel containment liner of Unit 1 should
not corrode under the present environmental conditions or any anticipated future conditions even without an operating
cathodic protection system. Monthly inspections from May 1990 (following issuance of Amendment No. 7 to the Possession-Only
License No. DR-12 on April 25, 1990) through April 1994 have not detected any water in the containment building. Prior
to Amendment No. 7, the inspection of Unit 1 was performed semi-annually. A review of these semi-annual inspections
dating back to October 1981 determined that water has never been detected in the accessible areas below ground level
in the containment building. The TS limit water accumulation in the containment sump to 500 gallons. Twelve and one-half
years of inspections have confirmed the reliability of the design of Unit 1 to maintain integrity against any ground
water intrusion. There is no reason, based on the review of inspection data, why the inspection could not be performed
semi-annually rather than monthly. Therefore, these proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

b. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components. The proposed changes do not affect the plant SAFSTOR status. Therefore, the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.

c. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes do not
affect the plant SAFSTOR status. Because proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative in nature, they do not involve
a question of safety. The semi-annual inspection of the accessible areas below ground level in the containment building
for water accumulation, as proposed by change 3, is adequate to ensure containment building integrity is maintained
with respect to ground water. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Technical Specifications. The Section 3.4 revision
would reduce the maximum allowable percent of rated power associated with inoperable Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs).
This change would modify Table 3.4-1 and the associated Basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation
with inoperable MSSVs is below the heat removing capability of the operable MSSVs. The Section 3.5 revision would
correct administrative errors in the action statements associated with Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4. Additionally,
the proposed changes to Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 would clarify the action statements associated
with inoperable high containment pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:

(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?

Response:

The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. This proposed technical specification change would modify Table 3.4-1 and the associated
basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation with inoperable MSSVs is below the heat removing capability
of the operable MSSVs. This proposed technical specification change will be more conservative than the current technical
specifications. Proposed changes to Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4 would restore the original intent of the specifications
and remove undue restrictions on the plant. Proposed changes to Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 clarify
the action statements associated with inoperable high containment pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?
 
Response:

The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change incorporates more conservative limits on the maximum power level allowed
for operation with inoperable MSSVs, restores the original intent of items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4, and clarifies
action statements associated with item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and item 2.b of Table 3.5-4.

(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

Response:

The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This proposed technical specification
change would modify Table 3.4-1 and the associated basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation with
inoperable MSSVs is below the heat removing capability of the operable MSSVs. This proposed technical specification
change will be more conservative than the current technical specifications. Proposed changes to Items 2.a and 2.c
of Table 3.5-4 would restore the original intent of the specifications and remove undue restrictions on the plant.
Proposed changes to Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 clarify the action
statements associated with inoperable high containment pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise the fuel oil availability requirements for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs)
from Section 3.7 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). This TS change would require that 30,026 gallons of fuel oil
be available onsite in addition to the oil in the EDG storage tanks. TS 3.7.F.4 is also being changed to require a total
of 7056 gallons of fuel in the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. In addition, several administrative changes are being proposed
to remove the word ``available'' from the phrase ''... gallons of fuel available...'' in Section 3.7.A.5 (for the
individual storage tanks) to avoid confusion regarding the amount of usable fuel in the tanks.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 
Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:



(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously analyzed?

Response:

The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed. The change in the minimum required volume for the EDG fuel oil storage tanks ensures that two EDGs can power
minimum safeguards equipment for 48 hours. The new required levels allow for temperature effects on fuel density
and calibration uncertainties. The change to the minimum amount of fuel that must be stored onsite is based on a new
fuel consumption profile and ensures that sufficient oil is present, even in the unlikely event that one EDG storage
tank (and its associated day tank) is unavailable. The change to specification 3.7.F.4 is consistent with the newly
calculated amount of usable fuel and instrument uncertainties.

The deletion of the word ``available'' from Section 3.7.A.5 (concerning the individual storage tanks) and the change
to Reference 2 of Section 3.7 are administrative in nature and do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of a previously analyzed accident.

(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?

Response:

The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because the changes do not affect current plant configuration or how the plant operates. The proposed change
in the minimum required volume for the EDG fuel oil storage tanks ensures an adequate amount of usable fuel and allows
for temperature effects on fuel density and calibration uncertainties. The change to the minimum amount of fuel that
must be stored onsite is based on a new fuel consumption profile and ensures that sufficient oil is present, even in
the unlikely event that one EDG storage tank (and its associated day tank) is unavailable. These changes do not alter
how the fuel storage tanks operate and therefore do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
Specification 3.7.F.4 is being changed consistent with the revised calculation.

The deletion of the word ``available'' from Section 3.7.A.5 (concerning the individual storage tanks) and the change
to Reference 2 of Section 3.7 are administrative in nature and do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident.

(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

Response:

The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change in the minimum
required volume for the EDG fuel oil storage tanks ensures the required amount of usable fuel is available for two EDGs
to operate minimum safeguards for 48 hours, and it allows for temperature effects on fuel density and calibration
uncertainties. The change to the minimum amount of fuel that must be stored onsite is based on a new fuel consumption
profile and ensures that sufficient oil is present, even in the unlikely event that one EDG storage tank (and its associated
day tank) is unavailable. Specification 3.7.F.4 is being changed consistent with the revised calculation.

The deletion of the word ``available'' from Section 3.7.A.5 (concerning the individual storage tanks) and the change
to Reference 2 of Section 3.7 are administrative in nature and do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego County,
New York




Date of amendment request: 

August 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications (TSs) to revise the primary containment atmosphere
monitoring and drywell to torus differential pressure requirements. Specifically, TS 3.7.A.6 would be revised
to adopt primary containment inerting/deinerting requirements that are consistent with NUREG-1433, ``Standard
Technical Specifications - General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' TSs 4.7.A.6.a and 4.7.A.7.a would be revised to provide
frequencies for the verifications of primary containment oxygen concentration and pressure differential between
the drywell and torus. TSs 3.7.A.7.a.(1) and 3.7.A.7.a.(3) would be revised to provide requirements for establishing
and maintaining differential pressure between the drywell and torus that are consistent with NUREG-1433. Several
administrative changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.3-8 were also proposed to improve the overall quality of the TSs.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes revise primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements. The proposed changes adopt
reference plant operating conditions (i.e., 15% rated thermal power) for inerting/de-inerting requirement as
well as for the drywell to torus differential pressure monitoring consistent with the NRC guidance provided in the
Standard Technical Specifications. The FitzPatrick Technical Specifications currently allow a 24 [hour] grace
period following startup or before shutdown in which the primary containment does not have to be inerted. During this
24 hour time period required leak inspections as well as inerting or shutdown evolutions are completed. Making the
24 hour ``window'' contingent upon core thermal power will allow [operators] to place the mode switch in run sooner,
removing startup neutron monitoring instrumentation scrams (i.e., APRM 15% and IRM upscale/inop). This reduces
the probability of spurious trips due to spiking of this instrumentation. The proposed changes do not involve physical
modification to the plant nor involve any accident initiators. Therefore, the probability of an accident occurring
remains unchanged. Accident analyses contained in FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] Chapter 14 assume that a LOCA
[Loss-of-coolant accident] occurs from full power. The consequences of a LOCA below 15% rated thermal power would
be less severe and would produce less hydrogen.

The proposed changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.2-8 will eliminate the reference to Specifications 3.7.A.9 by moving the
primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements from Specification 3.7.A.9 to Table 3.2-8, Note F. Note
F is also revised such that if recorder 279CR-101A or B is inoperable, a daily monitoring and logging of the appropriate
parameter on the associated indicator on panel 279CX-101A, B is acceptable in lieu of taking grab samples. The monitoring
will be performed using indicators on 279CX-101A and B which are Regulatory Guide 1.97 qualified analyzers. The proposed
new Note K is added for completeness. These changes are administrative in nature and will improve the overall quality
of the technical specifications. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
The proposed changes revise primary containment atmosphere monitoring requirements by adopting STS [Standard
Technical Specifications] guidance regarding inerting/de-inerting requirements. Consistent with this change
the drywell to torus differential pressure monitoring requirement is being revised. Adopting the STS reference
plant operating condition of 15% rated thermal power adds operational flexibility. The proposed changes do not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the plant safety
analyses assume that a LOCA occurs at full power. In addition, several changes are proposed to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.2-8
which simplify hydrogen/oxygen monitoring requirements by moving the primary containment monitoring requirements
from Specification 3.7.A.9 to Table 3.2-8. These changes are administrative in nature and will result in the overall
improvement to the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes revise the primary containment atmosphere inerting/de-inerting requirements and the drywell
to torus differential pressure monitoring requirement. The proposed change will allow inerting within 24 hours
of exceeding 15% rated thermal power during startup and de-inerting 24 hours prior to reducing thermal power to less
than 15% of rated before a plant shutdown. These requirements are consistent with the guidance provided in the STS.
This proposed change does not affect the assumptions or conclusions contained in the plant safety analyses which
assume that a LOCA occurs from full power. The consequences of a LOCA below 15% rated thermal power would be less severe
and would produce less hydrogen. The proposed changes to Tables 3.2-8 and 4.3-8 are administrative in nature. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket No. 50-354, Hope Creek Generating Station, Salem County, New Jersey




Date of amendment request: 

July 27, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment request proposes to revise the Allowed Out-of-service Times (AOTs) for: inoperable Station Service
Water System (SSWS) pumps, inoperable Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System (SACS) pumps, and inoperable Emergency
Diesel Generators (EDGs). In addition, this request is also proposing to allow online maintenance of the EDGs.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


PSE&G has, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, reviewed the proposed amendment to determine whether our request involves
a significant hazards consideration. We have determined that operation of the Hope Creek Generating Station in accordance
with the proposed changes:

1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

LCR 94-08

Station Service Water System (SSWS) Changes

Engineering evaluations of the SSWS/Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System (SACS) demonstrate that adequate heat removal
capability is maintained in the post LOCA/LOP period with either two SSWS/SACS pumps in one loop or with one SSWS/SACS
pump in each independent loop. The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analyses of
the SSWS determined that the probability of an accident previously evaluated does not significantly change by increasing
the SSWS pump AOT from 7 days to 30 days. The evaluations demonstrated that the relative risk remained low with an increased
(and more appropriate) AOT due to capabilities of the Hope Creek SSWS to accommodate active failures.

Increasing the SSWS pump AOT does not involve physical alteration of any plant equipment and does not affect analysis
assumptions regarding functioning of required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents. Further,
the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiological effluent releases will not be affected by the increased
AOT.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System Changes

Engineering evaluations of the SSWS/SACS demonstrate that adequate heat removal capability is maintained in the
post LOCA/LOP period with either two SSWS/SACS pumps in one loop or with one SSWS/SACS pump in each independent loop.
The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analysis of the SACS determined that the probability
of an accident previously evaluated does not significantly change by increasing the SACS pump AOT from 72 hours to
30 days. Similarly, the provision of a 72 hour AOT for one SACS pump inoperable in each SACS loop does not significantly
change the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The evaluations demonstrated that the relative risk
remained low with an increased (and more appropriate) AOTs due to capabilities of the Hope Creek SACS to accommodate
active failures.

Increasing the SACS pump AOTs does not involve physical alteration of the plant equipment and does not affect analysis
assumptions regarding functioning of required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents. Further,
the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiological effluent releases will not be affected by the increased
AOTs.

The proposed changes to ACTION Statement a.2 of Technical Specification 3.7.1.1 precludes overly conservative
and improper operator action (initiation of plant shutdown procedures) to comply with the requirements in the situation
in which one of the affected EDGs (an EDG cooled by the inoperable SACS loop) is not realigned to OPERABLE SACS loop.
Currently, Hope Creek can simultaneously be in the ACTION Statement for Technical Specifications 3.7.1.1 and 3.8.1.1.
Simultaneous entry into these ACTION Statements bounds the conditions of the plant when the proposed requirements
of the Technical Specification 3.7.1.1, ACTION Statement a.2 are met. For this reason, the proposed changes will
not increase the probabilities or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Technical Specification 3.7.1.1, ACTION Statements b., c. and d. are being revised to require that the RHR loop or
safety related equipment must be declared inoperable when two SACS pumps in the associated SACS loop are inoperable.
This change permits one SACS pump to be inoperable without affecting the operability of the associated RHR loop or
safety related equipment. Engineering evaluations demonstrate that two SACS loops with one pump and two heat exchangers
per loop can provide the required heat removal capability in the post DBA LOCA/LOP scenario and maintain safe shutdown
conditions. Therefore, a SACS loop with one OPERABLE SACS pump should still be considered as a 100% functional SACS
loop, capable of supplying sufficient cooling for RHR and safety related equipment required by Specifications 3.4.9.1,
3.4.9.2, 3.5.2, 3.9.11.1 and 3.9.11.2. For this reason, the proposed changes will not increase the probabilities
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

In conclusion, the above SACS changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.

LCR 94-11

Emergency Diesel Generator AOT Extensions.

The Hope Creek offsite and onsite power systems are highly reliable. The risk evaluations contained in the Probabilistic
Safety Assessment analyses of the onsite power system determined that the probability of an accident previously
evaluated does not significantly change by increasing the diesel generator AOT from 72 hours to 30 days for one inoperable
diesel generator or from 2 hours to 72 hours for two inoperable diesel generators. The evaluations demonstrated that
the relative risk remained low with an increased (and more appropriate) AOT due to capabilities of the four channel
onsite Class-1E electrical system design at Hope Creek.

Increasing the diesel generator AOT does not involve physical alteration of any plant equipment and does not affect
analysis assumptions regarding functioning of required equipment designed to mitigate the consequences of accidents.
Further, the severity of postulated accidents and resulting radiological effluent release will not be affected
by the increased AOT. 

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

LCR 94-12

Emergency Diesel Generator Online Maintenance

The proposed changes would require that the requisite number of diesel generators be in an operable condition, but
would eliminate the restriction that the 18 month maintenance inspection and other surveillance tests be performed
only while the unit is shutdown. Because all operational conditions (governed by the operability of the equipment
prescribed as necessary in Technical Specification 3.8.1.1) and the associated actions are defined elsewhere in
the Technical Specifications, the removal of this restriction would not involve as significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

LCR 94-08 
Station Service Water System (SSWS) Changes

Extending the SSWS pump AOTS does not necessitate physical alteration of the plant or changes in parameters governing
normal plant operation. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated for Hope Creek.

Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System Changes

The changes to the SACS do not necessitate physical alteration of the plant or changes in parameters governing normal
plant operation. Thus, these changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated for Hope Creek.

LCR 94-11

Emergency Diesel Generator AOT Extensions

Extending the diesel generator AOTs does not necessitate physical alteration of the plant or changes in parameters
governing normal plant operation. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated for Hope Creek.

LCR 94-12

Emergency Diesel Generator Online Maintenance

The proposed revisions will not change the method in which any of the 4.8.1.1.2.h surveillance activities are to be
performed, only the prescriptive operational condition is being removed. Since the operational conditions and
the associated actions are defined elsewhere in the Technical Specifications, the removal of this restriction will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

LCR 94-08

Station Service Water System (SSWS) Changes

As discussed above, the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analyses determined that the change in core damage frequency
for extended SSWS pump AOT is insignificant. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

Safety Auxiliaries Cooling System Changes

As discussed above, the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analyses determined that the change in core damage frequency
for the SACS changes are insignificant. Therefore, these changes do not result in a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.

LCR 94-11 
Emergency Diesel Generator AOT Extensions

As discussed above, the Probabilistic Safety Assessment analyses determined that the change in core damage frequency
for extended diesel generator AOTs is insignificant. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
LCR 94-12

Emergency Diesel Generator Online Maintenance

The margin of safety for the emergency power system depends on the proven, historical reliability of the diesel generators
and the surveillances verifying the power circuits between the offsite and the onsite power systems. The elimination
of the restrictions for performance of the maintenance tear down inspection would remain within the action parameters
of Technical Specification 3.8.1.1. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

Date of amendment request: 

July 28, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed Technical Specification changes contained herein represent changes to Section 3/4.8.1 ``AC Sources.''
The revised specification removes the surveillance requirements, methodology and frequency for Emergency Diesel
Generator (EDG) fuel oil from the Technical Specifications and relocates them in a controlled plant procedure, VSH.SS-CA.ZZ-0013(Q)
``Procedure for Testing Diesel Fuel and #2 Fuel Oil at Artificial Island for PSE&G Nuclear Operations.'' The
changes also delete an unnecessary lab test for the fuel oil and extend the surveillance frequency from once per 92
days to once per 184 days.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


1. Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change to delete a test not required by Regulatory Guide 1.137 or ASTM-D975-77 will not result in degradation
of fuel oil quality below acceptable limits. Based on established fuel oil quality history, the proposed increase
in surveillance frequency from once per 92 days to once per 184 days will not significantly decrease confidence in
fuel oil quality and EDG operability, nor will the relocation of fuel oil quality surveillance from the Technical
Specifications to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program have any effect on established plant practices in regards to
the testing of EDG fuel oil. The proposed changes involve no hardware changes, no changes to the operation of any systems
or components, and no changes to existing structures. Therefore, these changes will not alter or impact previously
evaluated accidents. 

2. Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are procedural in nature concerning fuel oil testing and, therefore, will not directly impact
the operation of any plant safety related component or equipment. Any reduction in fuel oil quality will not be significant
or result in a decrease in EDG operability. Therefore, these changes will not create a new or unevaluated operating
condition.

3. Will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes concern how EDG fuel oil quality is to be determined, how frequently this determination is to
be performed, and how to control the process for determining fuel oil acceptability, and therefore EDG operability.
There are no associated safety margins and the only margin of concern is that of fuel oil combustibility due to the presence
of either contaminants or particulate buildup from long term storage. Based on historical data, PSE&G believes
that EDG fuel oil quality will not be affected or impacted by the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve any reduction in a safety margin.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment requests:

Description of amendment requests: 

This is a proposal to revise the Units 2 and 3 Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.3, ``Component Cooling Water System,''
and the corresponding Bases to support the addition of the component cooling water surge tank backup nitrogen supply
(BNS) system. The amendment is necessary to establish new operability and surveillance requirements for the system.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

Response: No.

The Component Cooling Water (CCW) system removes heat to mitigate the consequences of those design basis accidents
included in chapter 15 of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). A CCW system failure is not an accident
initiating event as listed in the UFSAR, Table 15.0-2. The addition of the Backup Nitrogen Supply (BNS) system does
not change the CCW system function and does not interface with any system which relates to the initiating events listed
in Table 15.0-2 of the UFSAR. The BNS system is designed to Quality Class II, Seismic Category I requirements and will
increase CCW reliability by minimizing CCW system voiding during and after a Design Basis Event (DBE). Failure of
the BNS system will not by itself result in an accident or have any effect on normal plant operation. 

The proposed revision of Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.3 will not change the CCW system operation. This amendment
request retains the original CCW TS requirements and adds provisions specifically limited to the BNS system. The
proposed revisions provide an 8-hour Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for one or both trains of the BNS system inoperable
to avoid unnecessary plant power reductions. If the 8-hour AOT for BNS system inoperability is not met, the associated
CCW train(s) must be declared inoperable. The 8-hour AOT followed by either the 72-hour AOT for one train of CCW inoperable
or the 1-hour AOT provided by TS 3.0.3 for both trains of CCW inoperable results in overall AOTs of 80 and 9 hours, respectively.
The results of a conservative Probabilistic Risk Assessment demonstrate that for the overall 80-hour and 9-hour
AOTs the increases in core damage risk per year are 6.5E-7 and 8.6E-7, respectively. This results in less than a 3% increase
in the annual core damage risk for Units 2 and 3. 

The proposed revisions to TS 3/4.7.3 include surveillance requirements to provide assurance that the BNS system
remains OPERABLE when required to support CCW operation. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with
this proposed TS change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

Response: No

The BNS system does not change the CCW system function and does not interface with any system related to the initiating
events listed in Table 15.0-2 of the UFSAR. The BNS system is designed to Seismic Category I requirements and will minimize
CCW system voiding and the potential for a subsequent water hammer by maintaining the CCW surge tank pressure during
and after a DBE. No new High Energy Line Break considerations apply because the nitrogen bottle pressure is reduced
at the bottle header and all connections are less than one inch in diameter. The BNS system is independent from all systems
possibly related to the initiating DBEs listed in the UFSAR Table 15.0-2. 
The proposed TS 3/4.7.3 revision does not change the existing CCW system requirements. This proposed change adds
operability and surveillance requirements for the BNS system to support CCW system operability and provide additional
assurance that plant operation is consistent with the design basis. Failure of the BNS system will not by itself result
in an accident or have any effect on normal plant operation. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a
margin of safety?

Response: No

The addition of the BNS system enhanced the CCW system by minimizing the possibility for water hammer following certain
postulated events. Surveillance and nitrogen bottle change-out procedures assure that the BNS system is available
to perform its safety-related function. The redundant cooling capacity of the CCW system is maintained by providing
an independent dedicated BNS system for each CCW critical loop, assuming a single failure. 

The safety function of the BNS system is limited to the minimization of void formation in the CCW system under a specific
set of coincident circumstances following a DBE. The proposed revision to TS 3/4.7.3 allows the BNS system to have
one or both trains inoperable for 8 hours before the associated CCW train(s) must be declared inoperable. The BNS system
AOTs do not affect plant operation because the BNS system is not normally in operation. The BNS system action statements
are not normally entered for normal bottle change out since the BNS system is designed with one more bottle than is required
for seven days of BNS system operation. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri




Date of amendment request: 

May 20, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications to incorporate improvements endorsed by the NRC
Final Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) and, therefore, will be controlled
and implemented as FSAR commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety significance
but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state, (for example, through surveillance programs) would
be controlled.

In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.

Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document, i.e. FSAR Chapter 16. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the
operation of the plant or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the FSAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
from the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.
 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would delete the sections describing the On-Site Review Committee (ORC) and the Nuclear Safety
Review Board (NSRB) from the Technical Specifications. This change also removes reference to the Manager, Nuclear
Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Additionally, the change reflects an organizational restructuring which addresses
the Independent Safety Engineering Group (ISEG) reporting to the Manager, Quality Assurance.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The changes are administrative and equivalent descriptions and requirements for these oversight committees are
contained in FSAR Section 13.4.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

These changes do not involve any physical alterations to the plant. There is no new type of accident or malfunction
created and the method and manner of plant operation will not change. The changes are administrative and equivalent
descriptions and requirements for these oversight committees are contained in FSAR Section 13.4.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The margin of safety remains unaffected since no design change is made and plant operation remains the same. The changes
are administrative and equivalent descriptions and requirements for these oversight committees are contained
in FSAR Section 13.4.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Date of amendment request: 

July 12, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the technical specifications (TS) to remove instrument response time limit
tables for the reactor protection system (RPS) and isolation actuation and emergency core cooling system (ECCS)
from the TS. The affected instrument response time limit tables would be located in the Final Safety Analysis Report
(FSAR).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The RPS, Isolation Actuation and ECCS Instruments provide signals to the actuation logic for safety equipment needed
to mitigate accidents and transients. The proposed change relocates the instrument response times from the Technical
Specifications to the FSAR but will not affect the operability or surveillance requirements of the affected instruments.
The instruments will continue to be proven operable on the schedule provided in the Technical Specifications. 

The FSAR change process and Plant Operations Committee review responsibilities ensure that changes to the response
time limits cannot be made without adequate review and approval. Since operability confirmation as required by the
Technical Specifications (surveillance testing requirements) will not be affected by the change and the limits
themselves cannot be altered without adequate review and approval, there is no possibility of a significant increase
in the probability of an accident previously approved as a result of this change.

The instruments provide signals to the actuation logic of equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident.
However, since no changes are being made in the methods or frequencies of proving operability the systems will not
be degraded or be made susceptible to degradation that could go unidentified. As discussed above, changes to the limits
will not be made without adequate review and approval. Hence, this change will not affect the capability of the plant
to mitigate a previously evaluated accident. Because the mitigative capability is not affected there is no significant
increase in the consequences of a previously evaluated accident as a result of this change.

For the above reasons, the change does not represent a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
 
The proposed change relocates only the tables containing the instrument response times for the RPS, Isolation Actuation
and ECCS response time limits from the Technical Specifications to the FSAR. The change does not affect how these instruments
will function. Relocation of this information does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the
plant. No new hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed change. Plant procedures are not affected
by the change. The Technical Specification sections for the surveillance testing of these instruments will not be
affected. Therefore, the Technical Specifications will continue to require that the same operability and surveillance
requirements be met for the affected instruments.

Consequently, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed is not
introduced as a result of this change.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The margin of safety established by the response time limits is in ensuring that the RPS, Isolation Actuation and ECCS
systems will respond in time to support the assumptions of the accident analysis. Relocating the response time limits
to the FSAR does not alter the operability or the surveillance requirements applicable to the affected instruments.
These instruments will continue to be tested for operability and therefore remain capable of responding to accident
events within the time limits required by the accident analysis. The administrative change control provisions for
the FSAR, the plant procedures implementing the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59 and the administrative sections of the
Technical Specifications are adequate to control changes to the response time limits such that they cannot be altered
in a manner that would adversely affect plant safety.

Therefore, for these reasons, the change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 23, 1994, as supplemented on July 26, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments consist of two parts: Part one, would revise ``Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC)''
Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow the use of a slightly positive MTC for the core design. The licensee has stated
that a positive MTC will reduce the burnable rod requirements and improve operational flexibility. Because of using
a positive MTC, the TSs would be revised to permit a higher boron concentration in the refueling water storage tank,
the reactor coolant system (RCS) accumulators, and the refueling cavity, in order to ensure adequate shutdown margin
is maintained at all times. Part two, would revise the TSs to reduce the required RCS flow to offset any reduction in
flow due to increased steam generator tube plugging. Additionally, the associated Bases for the above TSs would be
revised to describe the basis for the TS requirements.
Because Byron, Unit 1, and Braidwood, Unit 2, will be in refueling outage in the fall of 1994, the proposed TS changes
will apply to them. Byron, Unit 2 and Braidwood, Unit 1 will continue to operate in accordance with the current TSs.
The licensee's submittal identified the appropriate unit applicability of the TSs pertaining to the positive MTC
and the required RCS flows.

During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application complies with the standards and requirements
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission
has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I,
which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for A Hearing in connection with these actions was published in the


Federal Register 

as indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applications for amendment, (2) the amendment, and (3) the
Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment as indicated. All of these items
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document rooms for the particular facilities involved. 



Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket No. STN 50-529, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 2, Maricopa
County, Arizona




Date of application for amendments: 

July 1, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated August 11, 1994


Brief description of amendment: 

The proposed amendment changes the minimum cold-leg temperature for core power levels between 90 percent and 100
percent to 552 degrees Fahrenheit for Unit 2 (which is a reduction of 10 degrees Fahrenheit from the previous technical
specification (TS) requirement). This TS change permits reactor operation at full power with a lower reactor coolant
temperature to minimize potential steam generator tube degradation. The cold-leg temperature reduction at power
levels above 90 percent was previously granted for Units 1 and 3 by letter dated June 7, 1994. 

Date of issuance: 

August 12, 1994


Effective date: 

August 12, 1994


Amendment No.:

Date of application for amendment: 

June 20, 1994, as supplemented on August 18, 1994.


Brief description of amendment: 

The amendment revises Technical Specification (TS) 4.4.5.4.a(11) by moving a footnote into the body of the text.
Additionally, Item 3 of TS Section 4.4.5.4.a(11) has been revised to remove the licensee's previous calculation
of primary-to-secondary leakage of 26 gallons per minute (gpm) at the end of 100 calendar days of operation in the present
fuel cycle. In place of this value, the licensee's revised calculated value of less than 9.1 gpm at the end of Cycle 5
is inserted, including a reference to the basis for this revised estimate (i.e; WCAP-14046). Finally, Section 3.4.8.a
is revised to remove the limit on operating time in the present fuel cycle. The maximum permissible dose equivalent
Iodine-131 concentration in the footnote to Section 3.4.8.a remains at 0.35 microcuries per gram of coolant as proposed
by the licensee in its letter dated August 18, 1994. The net result of these revisions is to remove the limitation on
permissible operating time from the Braidwood 1 TSs.

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensee), for operation of the Millstone
Nuclear Power Station, Unit 3, located in New London County, Connecticut.
The proposed amendment would grant a one-time change to the Action Statement for Limiting Condition for Operation
3.7.5 of the Technical Specifications. The amendment would permit Millstone Unit No. 3 to remain in Modes 1, 2, 3, or
4 while the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink is greater than 75
 F for a 24 hour period for the months of August and September 1994. Exigent action is justified in order to permit
the licensee to continue operations in the above mentioned Modes.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1)
Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below:
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
The proposed temporary change to the Action Statement of LCO 3.7.5 of the Millstone Unit No. 3 Technical Specifications
will increase the time the plant may be in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink
greater than 75
 F from 6 hours to 24 hours. The proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously
analyzed. The probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased by a short term increase in the ultimate
heat sink average water temperature. The probability of Condition IV accidents, as described in Chapter 15 of the
FSAR, occurring in conjunction with the short duration increase in ultimate heat sink average water temperature
above 75
 F is low enough such that they are not risk significant. Further, an evaluation has been performed that safe shutdown
will be achieved and maintained for a loss of offsite power and a steam generator tube rupture event with the additional
consideration of a single failure with ultimate heat sink average water temperatures as high as 77
 F. There has been no significant increase in the consequences of these previously evaluated events.
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
The proposed temporary technical specification change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident previously analyzed. The change increases the amount of time that is allowed for the plant to be in hot standby
should the ultimate heat sink average water temperature increase above 75
 F from 6 to 24 hours. This extension of the time allowed for the plant to be in hot standby does not change the plant
configuration. As such, the change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously
evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
The proposed technical specification change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The
proposed change increases the time required for the plant to be in hot standby from 6 to 24 hours should the ultimate
heat sink average water temperature exceed 75
 F. An evaluation has been performed to demonstrate that the risk significance associated with the increased
action time is very low. In addition, safe shutdown capability has been demonstrated for ultimate heat sink average
water temperatures as high as 77
 F.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By September 29, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ms. L. M. Cuoco, Senior Nuclear Counsel, Northeast Utilities Service Company, Post Office
Box 270, Hartford, Connecticut 06141-0270, attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated August 19, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim form; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service proposes to revise PS Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation. Under the
revised form, publishers of second-class publications will be required to calculate the percentage of paid or requested
circulation of each publication. Publishers will also be required to indicate the date of issue in which the Statement
of Ownership will be printed. An interim revision of the form is being printed for distribution to publishers before
October 1, 1994. A final edition of the form will be based on the comments received from this notice. Publishers may
use the revised interim form or the previous January 1991 edition to meet their filing requirements for this year.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Publishers are required to furnish to the Postal Service certain information for each of their publications that
has second-class mail privileges. The Postal Service uses this information to determine whether these publications
continue to qualify for such authorization. 39 U.S.C. 3685. 



PS Form 3526 has been revised on an interim basis for the October 1, 1994, filing requirement. The final version of the
form will be based on the comments received from this notice. Publishers may use the revised interim form or the previous
January 1991 edition to meet their filing requirements for this year. 

The interim form has been reduced to standard size paper (81/2 by 11 inches) and is printed on two sides. The reverse
contains space for questions concerning circulation of the publication. There are two additional pieces of information
that will be required from publishers under the new form. An additional space is provided for the publisher to calculate
and report the percentage of paid or requested circulation for the publication. In addition, a space has been provided
for the publisher to provide the date of the issue in which the Statement of Ownership will be printed. Alternatively,
there is a box that the publisher can check if the Statement of Ownership is not required to be published. 

These changes will facilitate the processing and use of the form. Information provided on PS Form 3526, Statement
of Ownership, Management, and Circulation, will be used for scheduling the eligibility review of the publications,
if necessary.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule
Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Indexed Term Notes



August 25, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 8, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. On August 24, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule
change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''),
Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based in whole or in part on changes in the value of ten or more
equity securities representing industrial companies (``Index''). The text of the proposed rule change is available
at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Under Section 107 of the Guide, the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily
categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants.
 The Amex now proposes to list for trading, under Section 107A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part
on a static index composed of ten or more actively-traded equity securities. The securities to be included in the Index
will include the stocks of companies in basic industries such as chemicals, metals, steel, aluminum, paper and oil.
The specific composition of the Index will be determined by the issuer, Lehman Brothers, Inc., based on its market
research and investment strategy, prior to approval of the proposed rule change.






The Notes will be non-convertible debt securities and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of
the Guide.
 Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the
Notes will provide for maturity within a period of not less than one nor more than seven years from the date of issue.
Notes may provide for periodic payments and/or payments at maturity based on whole or in part or in part on changes in
the value of the Index and may feature a ``cap'' on the maximum amount to be paid either periodically or at maturity.
Additionally, the Notes shall provide that at maturity, holders will receive not less than 90% of the principal amount
of the Notes.
 Prior to the commencement of listing and trading of the Notes, the Exchange shall distribute a circular to its membership
providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities, including appropriate suitability
criteria and/or guidelines.







Eligibility Standards for Index Components



The Components of the Index shall meet the following criteria: (1) a minimum market capitalization of $75 million,
except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a market capitalization of not less than $50 million; (2)
trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than one million shares, except
that up to 10% of the component securities may have a trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of
the Notes of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least 90% of the weight of the Index and at least 80% of the total number
of components will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915;
(4) all components of the Index will be listed on the Amex on the New York Stock Exchange, or will be listed on the Amex
or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be National Market securities traded through NASDAQ; (5) all components of
the Index will be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Act; and (6) no more than 20% of
the weight of the Index shall be represented by foreign securities or ADRs for which the Exchange does not have in place
a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the appropriate regulatory organization(s) in such country(ies).






Index Calculation



The Index will be calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the
component securities is represented in an approximately equal dollar amount in the Index. To create the Index, a portfolio
of equity securities will be established by the issuer representing an investment of a specified dollar amount in
each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market
value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding
the establishment of the Index.

The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate
actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split,
reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with
respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary,
in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as
the distribution of property by an issuer to shareholders, the expropriation or nationalization of a foreign issuer
or the imposition of certain foreign taxes on shareholders of a foreign issuer. Shares of a component security may
be replaced (or supplemented) with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component
stock into another class of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary.
If the security remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share,
to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action.
 In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index.





The value of the Index will be calculated continuously by the Amex and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated
Tape Association's Network B.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(B)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and national market system.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Interpretation of Rule G-37 on Political Contributions and Prohibitions
on Municipal Securities Business </DOCTITLE>



August 35, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), and Rule 19b-4
thereunder, notice is hereby given that on August 18, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board''
or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Board. The purpose of the proposed rule
change is to provide interpretative guidance concerning rule G-37 on political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business. The Board has designated this proposal as constituting a stated policy, practice,
or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board under
Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, which renders the proposal effective upon receipt of this filing by the Commission.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The Board is filing the proposed rule change to provide interpretative guidance concerning rule G-37 on political
contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business.
 





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule change




In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Board has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G-37. concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business.
 In response to numerous inquiries received by the Board concerning the application of the rule, on May 24, 1994, the
Board filed with the Commission a Question and Answer (``Q&A'') interpretation of the rule.
 Since that time, the Board has continued to receive questions concerning the rule. Thus, in an effort to further assist
dealers in understanding and complying with rule G-37, the Board is filing this second Q&A relating to rule
G-37. As previously stated, the Board will continue to monitor the application of rule G-37, and, from
to time, will publish additional notices of interpretations, as necessary. 






The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides
that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest. 



B. 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



Because the proposed rule change would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers, the
Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others 



Written comments were neither solicited nor received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder because the rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation
with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board. 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the Board. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSRB-94-15 and should be submitted by September
21, 1994. 

 


For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change and Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Amendments
to Rules 450 (``Restriction on Giving of Proxies''), 451 (``Transmission of Proxy Material''), 452 (``Giving Proxies
by Member Organizations'') and 465 (``Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material'')</DOCTITLE>



August 25, 1994.



I. Introduction


On October 22, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend various exchange rules.






Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on January 12, 1994.
 On April 22, 1994, the NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal.
 Five comment letters were received on the proposal.
 This order approves the proposed rule change including, on an accelerated basis, Amendment No. 1.







II. Description of the Proposal



The Exchange is amending several NYSE Rules related to the giving of proxies and the transmission of proxy and other
related materials. Specifically, the NYSE is amending NYSE Rules: 450_Restriction on Giving of Proxies; 451_Transmission
of Proxy Material; 452_Giving Proxies by Member Organization, and 465_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other
Material.

The proposed amendments to NYSE Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 will permit investment advisers registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 who exercise investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated
in writing by the beneficial owner, to receive proxy soliciting materials, annual reports and other related material
and to vote proxies in lieu of the beneficial owners of securities. The term investment adviser is defined to include
a registered broker-dealer (

e.g.,

 a member organization).

Currently, NYSE Rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities
held in its custody, unless the securities are beneficially owned by a member organization, the beneficial owner
has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is non-substantive,
or the member organization is the investment manager for an ERISA account. Currently, NYSE Rules also require transmission
of proxy and related issuer materials, as well as proxy voting instructions, to each beneficial owner of stock held
in the member organization's possession and control. Rule 451.60 explicitly requires that proxy material be sent
to a beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so.





According to the Exchange, a number of member organizations along with the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities
Industry Association (``SIA'') informed the Exchange that many of their customers who have their accounts managed
by investment advisers do not want to receive proxy related information and annual reports, or vote the proxy. These
member organizations have indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals, whom they pay to manage
their accounts, represent their interests relative to the companies in which they own stock because the professionals
are better qualified. In addition, the Exchange states that banks, investment advisers, and broker-dealers who
are not subject to the Exchange's or similar rules may receive proxy material and vote proxies on behalf of their customers
in accordance with fiduciary obligations set forth by contractual arrangement. Accordingly, the Exchange is making
the following changes to permit beneficial owners to designated investment advisers that are registered broker-dealers
to receive materials and proxies and to vote proxies.

NYSE Rule 450_Restrictions on Giving of Proxies_currently provides that no member organization shall give or authorize
the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name, or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted
under the provisions of Rule 452, unless the member organization is the beneficiary owner of the stock. The Exchange
proposes to add an exception (paragraph (2)) to Rule 450,
 that would provide that any person registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who
exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and who has been designated
in writing by the beneficial owner to vote the proxies for stock which is in the possession or control of the member organization,
may vote such proxy.





NYSE Rule 451_Transmission of Proxy Material_generally provides that, whenever a person soliciting proxies furnishes
a member organization copies of all soliciting material which the person is sending to registered holders, and satisfactory
assurance that he will reimburse such member organization for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such member
in connection with such solicitation, such member shall transmit to each beneficial owner of stock which is in its
possession or control, the material furnished. The Exchange is amending Rule 451, paragraph (a) to add the requirement
that the member organization may also transmit the soliciting material to an investment adviser registered under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the
beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of such stock (``designated investment
adviser'') to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner.

<TEXT>
 

The Exchange also is amending Rules 451(b)(1) and (2), which deal with what soliciting material the member organization
receiving proxy information shall transmit and when such transmission shall occur. As amended, Rule 451(b)(1) provides
that the member organization may transmit, with soliciting material, a request for voting instructions and a statement
to the effect that, if such instructions are not received by the tenth day before the meeting, the proxy may be given
at discretion by the owner of record of the stock, provided that such statement may be made only when the proxy soliciting
material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
at least fifteen days before the meeting. As amended, Rule 451(b)(1) also provides that when the proxy soliciting
material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
twenty-five days or more before the meeting, the statement accompanying such material shall be to the effect that
the proxy may be given fifteen days before the meeting at the discretion of the owner of the record of the stock. 

Rule 451(b)(2), as amended, provides that, instead of the material submitted under Rule 451(b)(1), the member organization
may transmit with the soliciting material a signed proxy indicating the number of shares held for the beneficial owner
and bearing a symbol identifying the proxy records of such member organization, and a letter informing the beneficial
owner or the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser of the necessity for completing the proxy form and
forwarding it to the person soliciting proxies in order that the shares may be represented at the meeting. 

The Exchange also is modifying two Supplementary Material provisions to Rule 451. Supplementary Material .10_Annual
Reports_is being amended to provide that annual reports shall be transmitted to beneficial owners or to beneficial
owners' designated investment advisers under the same conditions as those applying to proxy soliciting material
under Rule 451 even though it is not proxy soliciting material under the proxy rules of the Commission. Supplementary
Material .60_Duty to transmit even when requested not to_currently provides that proxy material must be sent to a
beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so. The Exchange is qualifying
the provision so that proxy material must be sent even though the beneficial owner has instructed not to do so, unless
the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to send such material to the beneficial owner's
designated investment adviser. 

The Exchange also is adding provisions for a beneficial owner's designated investment adviser to Rule 452_Giving
of Proxies by Member Organization, Voting procedure without instructions. As amended, the Rule provides that a member
who has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to an investment adviser registered
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for
the beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of such stock (``designated investment
adviser'') to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner and solicited voting instructions in accordance
with the provisions of Rule 451, and who has not received instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial
owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material, may give
or authorize giving of a proxy to vote such stock, provided certain enumerated conditions are met. 

The Exchange is making two changes to Rule 452 Supplementary Material .10_Giving a Proxy To Vote Stock. As amended,
paragraphs (1) and (2) state that a member organization may give a proxy to vote stock provided that: (1) It has transmitted
proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
in accordance with Rule 451 and (2) it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial
owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material. The remaining
condition in paragraph (3) is unchanged. 

Rule 465_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material_currently provides that a member organization, upon
request by a company, and when furnished with copies of interim reports of earnings or other material sent to stockholders,
and satisfactory assurance that it will be reimbursed by such company for out-of-pocket expenses , shall transmit
such reports of material to each beneficial owner of stock of such company held by the member organization and registered
in a name other than the name of the beneficial owner. The Exchange is qualifying Rule 465 by adding the following to
the end of the Rule: ``unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to transmit such
reports or material to a designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises
investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner.'' 

The Exchange states that the proposed rule change will not diminish a beneficial owner's rights to receive proxy related
materials and to vote proxies. Rather, it will give beneficial owners the option to designate their investment adviser
as the person to receive such materials and to vote proxies. The Exchange also believes that the changes will enable
member organizations to comply with customer desires concerning transmission of proxy materials and proxy voting.




III. Discussion of Comments 



The Commission received five comment letters recommending approval of this proposal. In its comment letter, Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. (``Sanford'') strongly endorses the NYSE's proposed rule changes relating to voting
of proxies and transmission of proxy and related issuer material.
 Sanford states that for many years those clients for which it acts as an investment adviser, managing accounts and
purchasing securities, have requested that it vote proxies and receive annual reports and other related materials
in connection with the securities they own. Sanford asserts that its clients find it incomprehensible that they may
give Sanford the power to determine the securities to be bought and sold but are not able to give them the ability to vote
their proxies. 





Sanford asserts that when clients open an advisory account they often do so in order to obtain the professional money
management services of the adviser and because they have determined that they do not have the time, expertise, or desire
to handle their own investments, and they often do not want to be responsible for proxy voting or to receive voluminous
issuer reports. Sanford also asserts that such clients have no need for issuer materials since they have already determined
that the adviser is to have authority to make investment decisions. Sanford believes that since such advisory clients
frequently have little familiarity with or knowledge of specific securities, they are often ill equipped to vote
proxies from such issuers.

<TEXT>
 

The Sanford letter emphasizes that clients retain investment advisers with the expectation that financial management
includes the expertise to vote proxies and that voting responsibility should be placed wherever the client chooses.
Finally, Sanford points out that the proposed changes to the NYSE Rules will not require a beneficial owner to grant
authority to vote his proxies but they will merely permit such owners to delegate such authority if they so desire.
Likewise, non-discretionary clients may still vote proxies themselves. 

In its comment letter, Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc. (``Davenport'') strongly supports the proposed changes.
 Davenports states that it acts as an investment adviser to over five hundred clients and a significant number of its
clients have expressed dismay over existing proxy mailing and voting regulations. Davenport believes that its clients
will be best served by permitting investment advisers who have custody of and exercise discretion over client accounts
the opportunity to render the additional service of voting proxies. 





In its comment letter, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (``Merrill Lynch'') supports the proposed changes
to the NYSE Rules and encourages their approval.
 Merrill Lynch states that it believes that the proposed amendments appropriately recognize the increased utilization
of registered investment advisers by its clients and appropriately permits its clients to designate the investment
adviser to vote proxies and receive proxy related issuer materials with respect to securities in clients' managed
accounts. 





In its comment letter, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (``Dean Witter'') supports the proposed changes because they benefit
its clients as well as other NYSE member firms.
 Dean Witter also states that when a client instructs an investment adviser to act with discretion to implement an investment
strategy, the client expects that such management power includes the expertise to vote proxies. Dean Witter states
that it has an increased number of managed accounts and it has received many requests from clients who wish to be relieved
of the responsibility of proxy voting and the receipt of voluminous numbers of reports by corporate issuers. 





In its comment letter, the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA Committee'')
strongly supports the proposed amendments to certain rules governing the voting of proxies as well as the transmission
of proxy and issuer related materials. The SIA Committee comment letter states that the proposed changes to NYSE Rules
450, 451, 452 and 465 resulted from clients of member firms expressing their desire to have such firms act on their behalf
whenever they are designated investment advisers. The SIA Committee states that the proposed changes coincide with
the growing regulatory perspective that an investment adviser's fiduciary obligations include the voting of proxies
unless otherwise directed by the clients. 

The SIA Committee letter concludes that overall, the requested relief would enhance the effectiveness of discretionary
account management and provide a service frequently requested by clients. While principles of corporate governance
mandate that beneficial owners of securities should have relevant information about issuers of those securities,
this is not necessarily the case when a beneficial owner has set up an investment advisory account wherein discretion
is given to the investment adviser to implement a suitable investment strategy. In this instance, virtually all clients
give discretion to their investment adviser to implement an investment strategy that is suitable for, and best reflects,
client objectives. The SIA Committee goes on to state that when an investment advisory account is set up it is almost
always the case that the client does not want the burden of receiving issuer mailings. Such clients have generally
determined that they do not have the time, expertise or desire to handle their own investments. Similarly, such clients
frequently do not want to be recipients of voluminous issuer reports that, for a fully diversified account, can be
described as ``mountainous.'' 


The SIA Committee states that clients with investment advisory accounts generally do not need to receive issuer mailings
or proxy materials since it is the adviser that has the authority and obligation to decide upon purchases and sales
in the account. Clients frequently have little or no role in the selection of specific securities in a discretionary
account and thus, they often have little or no familiarity with or knowledge of issuers and will be ill equipped to vote
provide from such issuers. 

The SIA Committee comment letter also states that NYSE member organizations are at a competitive disadvantage with
advisers not subject to NYSE regulation. The SIA states that investment advisers that are not registered as NYSE or
National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') members are able to enter into agreements with discretionary
clients to vote the client's securities. According to the SIA Committee, clients are seeking to delegate proxy voting
with increasing frequency and rather than receive voluminous issuer material, some potential clients have chosen
not to open advisory accounts and some existing clients have actually closed investment accounts. The SIA Committee
concludes that compelling NYSE member firms to continue to send such materials to a segment of clients who do not need
or want them serves no purpose and can only alienate a potential client base. 

The SIA Committee concludes by emphasizing that the proposed changes would not reduce a client's right either to vote
proxies or receive issuer materials, but rather would enhance a NYSE member's ability to comply with client instructions
under specific circumstances. 



IV. Discussion and Conclusion 



The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections
6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides, 

inter alias

, that the rules of an exchange be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.

The Commission believes that allowing investors to designate an investment adviser to receive proxy and related
issuer materials and vote their proxies removes impediments to a free and open market. As noted by the commenters,
investors have been requesting that investment advisers be authorized to receive issuer materials and vote proxies
for the investor. Investors choosing an investment adviser arrangement may feel that they do not need to receive issuer
information since the investment adviser is making investment decisions on the investor's behalf. The Commission
acknowledges that investors might view the receipt of issuers materials and the ability to vote proxies as part of
the investment adviser's continuing activities in managing customer accounts. Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges
that some investors, in choosing to utilize the services of an investment adviser, are indicating that they do not
have the knowledge or inclination to review complicated issuer or proxy materials or to vote proxies. These investors,
in particular, may feel frustrated when inundated with unwanted issuer materials. Furthermore, the Commission
believes that the proposed rule change will permit the investment adviser to make more expedient, informed investment
decisions, thereby facilitating securities transactions in accordance with the Act. For these reasons, the Commission
believes that the proposed rule change appropriately gives investors the freedom to choose whether to receive proxy
and related issuer materials and vote the proxies or to designate an investment adviser to perform these functions
on their behalf.

Section 6(b)(5) of the Act also provides that the rules of an exchange should protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors. The Commission notes that the rule change permits investors who wish to receive and vote proxies and receive
other issuer materials to continue to do so. The proposed rule change affords beneficial owners the choice to delegate
this authority when the beneficial owner has already granted discretion in his investment account to an investment
adviser. In addition, investors will have the authority to rescind designation of an investment adviser at any time,
and, prior to the effective date of such designation, member organizations must provide beneficial owners written
notice of their right to rescind the designation.
Finally, the Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which requires
that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act. The Commission believes the proposed rule change should serve to eliminate unnecessary burdens
on competition in recognition that advisers not subject to NYSE rules already are able to vote proxies for their clients.
The Commission finds good cause to accelerate approval of Amendment No. 1. Amendment No. 1 made clarifying, technical
changes to the text of the rule, and did not propose new substantive provisions to the proposed rule change.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act, that the proposed rule chance (SR-NYSE-93-37) is approved, including Amendment No.
1 on an accelerated basis.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Invesco Treasurer's Series Trust: Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


August 25, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').




 

Applicant: 

Invesco Treasurer's Series Trust (``Invesco'').



Relevant Act Sections: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from rule 24f-2 under the Act.



Summary of Application:

 Invesco requests an order to permit it to pay a share registration fee due under rule 24f-2 for its 1993 fiscal
year based on net sales, 

i.e.,

 new sales minus redemptions, rather than on gross sales, 

i.e.

, with no credit for redemptions.




Filing Date:

 The application was filed on June 7, 1994.



Hearing or Notification of Hearing: 

An order granting the application will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested parties may request a
hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary and serving applicant with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing
requests should be received by the SEC by 5:30 p.m. on September 19, 1994, and should be accompanied by proof of service
on applicant, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state
the nature of the writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons may request notification
of a hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary.



</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Invesco, a registered open-end investment company, filed a declaration pursuant to rule 24f-2 under the
Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933.


2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f-2 must file annual notices with the SEC and
pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f-2 notice is filed within
two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net
sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f-2 notice is not filed within two months,
the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f-2 notice
along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's
fiscal year.

3. Invesco's fiscal year ends on December 31. Invesco's transfer agent mailed Invesco's rule 24f-2 notice for
fiscal year 1993 on February 21, 1994, seven days before the deadline. The filing was not received in the SEC's mail
room until March 1, 1994, however, and was rejected as being too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on net
sales. If Invesco had filed the rule 24f-2 notice within the two month period, it would not have been required
to pay any registration fee because of net redemptions in fiscal year 1993. Since its filing was late, the rule requires
Invesco to pay a registration fee based on gross sales, which would equal $252,007.


Legal Analysis


1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and
to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
 In addition, the SEC must find that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing
deadline of rule 24f-2.




2. Invesco believes that its agent acted reasonably and in good faith in mailing its rule 24f-2 notice seven days
before the filing deadline. Invesco states that the delay in receipt of its filing was caused by the fact that at the
time the rule 24f-2 notice was mailed, the United States Postal Service's performance in delivering the mail
was ``comparatively poor.'' According to Invesco, this resulted, in part, from extreme weather conditions in the
early part of 1994. Invesco believes that it was reasonable to assume that mailing the rule 24f-2 notice seven
days before the filing deadline would assure timely receipt by the SEC.





3. Rule 24e-2 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to register a definite number of shares, in
addition to the indefinite number or amount registered under rule 24f-2. For a nominal amount, an investment
company that had redemptions during the prior fiscal year, but missed the rule 24f-2 two month deadline, may
register a definite number of shares under rule 24e-2 equal to the number of shares redeemed. Shares registered
under rule 24e-2 then can be used in future years to offset registration fees due under rule 24f-2 when the
company has net sales. Invesco, however, does not believe that its net sales in the foreseeable future will be close
to the level necessary to use such a credit fully.
4. Invesco also believes that it is appropriate in the public interest not to burden Invesco and its shareholders with
a registration fee based on gross sales. Thus, Invesco requests an exemption under section 6(c) from rule 24f-2
to permit it to pay the registration fee based on net sales even though their rule 24f-2 notice for fiscal year
1993 was not filed by February 28, 1994.

Extension of the Restriction on the Use of United States Passports for Travel To, In, or Through Lebanon


On January 26, 1987, pursuant to the authority of 22 U.S.C. 211a and Executive Order 11295 (31 FR 10603), and in accordance
with 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3), all United States passports, with the exception of passports of immediate family members
of hostages in Lebanon, were declared invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically validated
for such travel. This action was taken because the situation in Lebanon was so chaotic that American citizens there
could not be considered safe from terrorist acts.
Although there continues to be improvement in the security situation, review of the situation there has led me to conclude
that Lebanon continues to be an area ``* * *where there is imminent danger to the public health or the
physical safety of United States travellers'' within the meaning of 22 U.S.C. 211a and 22 CFR 51.73(a)(3).
Accordingly, all United States passports shall remain invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon unless specifically
validated for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State.
This Public Notice shall be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register 

and shall expire at the end of six months unless extended or sooner revoked by Public Notice.

<DOCTITLE>Acceptance of Noise Exposure Maps and Request for Review of Noise Compatibility Program for McCarran International
Airport, Las Vegas, NV</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
Clark County, Nevada, for McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada, under the provisions of Title I of the
Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150 are in compliance with
applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is also reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program
that was submitted for McCarran International Airport under Part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map,
and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before February 15, 1995.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the McCarran International Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of Part 150 effective August 19, 1994.





Under Section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible
land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in
which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested
and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.


Clark County, Nevada submitted to the FAA on March 9, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during the McCarran International Airport Part 150 Study conducted between May, 1992 and January
1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in Section 103(a)(1)
of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities,
be approved as a noise compatibility program under Section 104(b) of the Act.
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Clark County, Nevada.
The specific maps under consideration are Figure 11 ``Noise Exposure Map: 1992 with Existing Land Use'', and Figure
12, ``Noise Exposure Map: 1997 Existing and Approved Land'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps
for the McCarran International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on August 19, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the
maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150.
Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to
approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. If questions arise concerning
the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted
under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations
of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve
questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of Section 107 of the Act.
These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government.
These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps.
Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the maps depicting properties
on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agencies
and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification
by the airport operator, under Section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been
accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for McCarran International Airport, also effective
on August 19, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for
the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval
of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before February
15, 1995.
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 150, Section 150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

<ACTION>

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On February 2, 1994, the FAA determined
that the noise exposure maps submitted by the St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority under Part 150 were in compliance
with applicable requirements. On July 29, 1994, the Administrator approved the St. Lucie County International Airport
noise compatibility program. All of the recommendations of the program were approved.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for St. Lucie
County International Airport, effective July 29, 1994.


Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act (ASNA) of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility
program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measure should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program
recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following
determinations:
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical users, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Orlando, Florida.

The St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on January 26, 1994, the noise exposure maps, descriptions,
and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from October 11, 1991,
through January 21, 1994. The FAA completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted
by the St. Lucie County Port and Airport Authority. The specific maps under consideration were 1992 ``EXISTING CONDITIONS''
NOISE EXPOSURE MAP and 1997 ``FUTURE CONDITIONS'' NOISE EXPOSURE MAP in the submission. The FAA determined that these
maps for the St. Lucie County International Airport were in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination
was effective on February 2, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps in limited to
a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such
determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve
a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.

The St. Lucie County International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions
designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion
to the year 1997. It was requested that FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described
in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on February 2, 1994, and was required by a provision
of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise
control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval
of such program.

The submitted program contained six (6) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed
its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied.
The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Administrator effective July 29, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for all six (6) of the specific program elements. The approval action was for the following
program elements:





These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on July 29, 1994.
The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available
for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the St. Lucie County Port and Airport
Authority.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice publishes the ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Alaska and in the Washington, DC, Area, June 1994,'' prepared
by Runzheimer International under Government contract OPM-90-0705.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Sections 591.205(d) and 591.206(c) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, require that nonforeign area cost-of-living
allowance (COLA) survey summaries and calculations be published in the 

Federal Register

. Accordingly, OPM is publishing the complete ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Alaska and in the Washington DC Area,
June 1994,'' produced by Runzheimer International under contract with OPM. This report explains in detail the methodologies,
calculations, and findings of the winter 1994 living-cost surveys conducted in Alaska and in the Washington, DC area.



The report presents only the results of the winter 1994 surveys. It does not cover the summer 1993 living-cost surveys
conducted in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The results of the summer 1993 surveys were published
in the 

Federal Register 

on May 26, 1994. Reporting the summer and winter living-cost surveys separately allows OPM to adjust COLA rates where
warranted in a more timely manner.

Based on the winter 1994 living-cost surveys, Runzheimer computed index values of relative living costs in allowance
areas using an index scale where the living costs in the Washington, DC area equal 100. (See the Executive Summary of
the June 1994 Runzheimer report accompanying this notice.) OPM notes that the winter survey indices showed that the
COLA rate for the Rest of the State of Alaska is currently set at the proper level but that the rates authorized for all
of the other Alaska allowance areas are above levels warranted by the indices. However, the Treasury, Postal Service,
and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102-141), prohibits reductions in COLA rates through
December 31, 1995. Therefore, OPM is 

not 

proposing any adjustments to the COLA rates in Alaska at this time.

Executive Summary 



This report culminates the fifth living-cost comparison study undertaken by Runzheimer International for the Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) under contract OPM-90-0705. The contract requires Runzheimer to: 




(1) survey living costs in 4 cost-of-living allowance (COLA) areas and the Washington, D.C., area, and 
(2) compare living costs between the areas and the D.C. area. 




To determine living costs in the identified areas and build this report, Runzheimer researched over 1,000 outlets
and gathered more than 6,000 price quotes. 

This report presents the results of the living-cost surveys conducted during the winter of 1994. The results of the
summer 1993 surveys were presented in a report provided to OPM earlier this year. 

To ease interpretation of the research results, we display the outcome of the comparisons as living-cost indexes
in the table below. In addition, the table shows living-cost indexes for federal employees who have unlimited access
to commissary and exchange facilities because of their employment. The index for the Washington, D.C., area (not
shown) is 100.00 because it is, by definition, the reference area. 






One of the changes OPM requested this year was to separate the reporting of the summer and winter living-cost surveys.
The purpose of this change was to allow OPM to adjust COLA where warranted in a more timely manner. Other changes included:

 A moving average approach to introduce new federal employment weights, 
 A new methodology for collecting and analyzing automotive maintenance cost, and 
 Minor changes in pricing sources for certain items to refine the comparisons of D.C. and allowance area prices.


We discuss these and other adjustments in appropriate sections throughout this report. 

In addition, to monitor, fine-tune, and maintain effective control of the data-gathering efforts in Alaska, Runzheimer
sent a full-time research professional to Alaska to visit retail outlets, Runzheimer research associates, housing
data sources, and living communities.

Report to OPM on Living Costs 
in Alaska and in the Washington, DC, Area 



1. Introduction 



1.1 Report Objectives 



This comprehensive report culminates data-gathering and research work undertaken in Winter 1994 as required by
Task 2 of contract OPM-90-0705 between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Runzheimer International.
The report details the results of Runzheimer International's surveys of over 1,000 outlets to obtain more than 6,000
price quotes and the analyses of the data. 

In 1990, in fulfillment of Task 1 of the contract, Runzheimer worked with OPM to design a model for estimating comparative
living costs between the allowance areas and the Washington, D.C., area. Task 2 of the contract required that Runzheimer
apply the model by conducting living-cost surveys, analyzing the results, and developing living-cost comparative
indexes. On February 26, 1991, OPM published that model and the results of the first surveys conducted under the model
in the Federal Register

. On December 10, 1992, OPM published in the 

Federal Register

 the second report, which covered the summer 1991 and winter 1992 surveys. On August 30, 1993, OPM published in the 

Federal Register

 the next report that covered the summer 1992 and winter 1993 surveys; and on May 26, 1994, OPM published the results
of the summer 1993 surveys. 

This report provides only the results of the winter 1994 surveys. This change was made at OPM's request. Separating
the summer 1993 and winter 1994 surveys allowed OPM to adjust COLA rates where warranted in a more timely manner. 

The analyses establish the comparative cost differences between the listed allowance areas and the Washington,
D.C., area: 




1. Anchorage, Alaska 
2. Fairbanks, Alaska 
3. Juneau, Alaska 
4. Other Areas in Alaska (as represented by Nome, Alaska) 




By law, Washington, D.C., is the base or ``reference'' area for the nonforeign area COLA program. 

Task 2 of the OPM contract also required Runzheimer International to calculate comparative living costs in the areas
listed below and the Washington, D.C., area for federal civilian employees who have access to military commissaries
and post exchanges. 




1. Anchorage, AK 
2. Fairbanks, AK 




Under OPM regulations, federal civilian employees who have unlimited access to commissaries and post exchanges
due to their employment by the government may receive a different allowance rate than other federal employees. This
regulation does not apply to federal employees who have limited access or unlimited access for other reasons_e.g.,
being married to active or retired military personnel. 



1.2 Changes in This Year's Survey 



Runzheimer and OPM made several changes to the survey and analyses. These changes included: 

 Reporting the results of the summer and winter surveys separately, 
 Using a moving average approach to introduce new federal employment weights, 
 Updating appliance models or replacing one make with another where a previous brand was difficult to find, 
 Employing a new methodology for determining automobile maintenance costs, 
 Surveying only the cash price at branded gas stations unless only non-branded stations are available, and 
 More accurately defining the distinguishing differences between family dining and fine dining. 

Runzheimer has continued to include catalog sales in its survey. Since the Sears catalogs have been discontinued,
Runzheimer has researched hundreds of catalogs to determine which are most appropriate. Runzheimer researchers
found that most catalogs have uniform shipping charges. Only catalogs that sell merchandise in the allowance areas
and Washington, D.C. area were used. 

Appendix 3 identifies Goods & Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing Related pricing changes. Current
housing data can be found in Appendix 9A and Appendix 9B. Other changes are discussed where applicable in the report.




1.3 Pricing Period 




Runzheimer collected price data for the Alaska allowance areas (and, again, the Washington, D.C., area) in February
1994. As with the previous surveys, however, our research 
associates collected price data for items dependent upon the pricing of other items slightly later (i.e., in March
and April 1994). 

To ensure consistent seasonal catalog pricing, Runzheimer used fall/winter catalogs for the Alaska areas. 



1.4 Living Cost Components 



In accordance with federal regulations, expense components Runzheimer costed to develop analyses, comparisons,
and the report were: 




1. Housing and Housing Related Expenses 
2. Transportation 
3. Consumption Goods & Services 
4. Miscellaneous Expenses 




Runzheimer factored sales, excise and property taxes into the analysis where applicable. However, in keeping with
previous reports, we did not factor federal, state and local income taxes into the analysis. Because income taxes
significantly affect living costs, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes in future
surveys. 

Educational opportunities vary significantly among locations in terms of availability, quality, and other factors.
Runzheimer analysts and OPM officials agree that, without additional information, attempts to measure cost differences
in education in the selected areas would be highly subjective and would not add to the integrity of the model. Therefore,
education expense is not included in the model or surveys.

2. Overall Model 



2.1 Measurement of Living-Cost Differences 



The most common and most widely accepted way to measure living-cost differences between and among locations is to
select representative items that people purchase in these locations and to calculate the relative cost differences,
combining them according to their importance in terms of consumer expenditures. Runzheimer applied this methodology
to compare living costs in each of the allowance areas with living costs in the Washington, D.C., area. 

To move from this basic concept to computing comparative living costs between each allowance area and the Washington,
D.C., area, Runzheimer followed five main processes or steps: 

 


Step 1 Identify the segment of the population for which this analysis is being targeted (i.e., the target population).


Step 2 Determine how these people spend their money. 

Step 3 Select items to represent the expense categories for which these people spend their money. 

Step 4 Conduct pricing surveys of the selected items in each area. 

Step 5 Analyze cost ratios for the selected items and aggregate them according to the relative importance
of each item. 



2.1.1 Target Population: Federal Employees 



Runzheimer's living-cost model measures living-cost differences for non-military federal employees having annual
base salaries between $10,000 and $80,000, the salary range of the 1990 General Schedule of the Federal Government.
Because living-cost differences may vary depending on an employee's income level, Runzheimer designed its analytical
model to identify living costs at three income levels. 

In its first report to OPM, Runzheimer used the salary distribution of all General Schedule employees as of March 31,
1990, which OPM supplied, to determine the income levels that most accurately represent the federal employee population.
After analyzing the array of salary data, Runzheimer picked the midpoints of the lower, middle and upper thirds of
the distribution as its three income levels ($18,000, $28,400 and $45,200 respectively). 

Runzheimer applied the same income levels for this report as it did for the first. In previous reports, Runzheimer
recommended that OPM consider introducing changes in income levels and weights on a gradual basis. OPM agreed, and
this year OPM introduced new Federal employment weights that are based on a moving average. OPM has informed Runzheimer
that OPM plans to introduce other changes, such as new representative income levels and Consumer Expenditure Survey
(CES) weights, in future surveys. 

Runzheimer uses Federal employment weights in the model in two ways: (1) to combine survey data from multiple survey
areas within a single allowance area and (2) to combine relative living costs by income level within each allowance
area into a single index for the area (as required by section 591.205(c) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations). 

OPM's moving average allows the gradual introduction of new employment distribution data over time. The weights
are based on a three-year average of GS employment. Each year, the latest GS employment data will be added to the three-year
average, the oldest data will be deleted, and a new three-year average will be computed. This will keep the weights
current while mitigating any fluctuations due to short-term changes in Federal employment. 

In this first application of the moving average, OPM is departing slightly from the process described above in that
the three employment distributions used are for the periods of 1990, 1992, and 1993. The 1990 rather than the 1991 employment
is used because the model previously used 1990 data only. (See Appendix 13.) 



2.1.2 Determination of Expenditure Patterns 

2.1.2.1 Source of Expenditure Data 



Conforming with last year's process, Runzheimer used the ``prepub'' statistical reports from the 1988 CES dated
February 13, 1990 (see Appendix 1) as the basis for weighing expenditure patterns. 



2.1.2.2 Income Level Adjustments 



Because the CES reflected 1988 expenditure levels, Runzheimer reduced the three 1990 incomes back to 1988 levels
before beginning the expenditure analysis. To calculate estimated 1988 income levels, Runzheimer used the average
percentage salary increases of federal employees for the two-year period in question as supplied by OPM officials
(4.1% increase 1988-89 and 3.6% increase 1989-90, resulting in a 7.85% two-year increase). This adjustment
reduced the 1990 income levels to estimated 1988 levels of $16,700, $26,300, and $41,900. 



2.1.2.3 Family Size Considerations 



A family size of 2.6 was inherent in the weighing scheme Runzheimer employed to price all allowance areas. Derived
from CES research, the number represented an average for the nation.

2.1.2.4 Analysis of the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey 



From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer used the statistical report entitled ``Table 2. Income before Taxes,'' which listed
average expenditures for families earning similar incomes, organized into eight income ranges. Runzheimer analyzed
these data to develop typical spending patterns for the three income profiles identified in 2.1.2.2. (The table below
displays the results of the analysis.) 

Seven income ranges encompassed the salary range of the General Schedule: 

 


$10,000 to $14,999 

$15,000 to $19,999 

$20,000 to $29,999 

$30,000 to $39,999 

$40,000 to $49,999 

$50,000 and over 

All respondents combined 

 


The 1988 CES grouped expenses into small, logical families of items. For example, the report divided money spent by
families on beef into four groups: ground beef, roast, steak and other beef. The steak and roast groupings were further
separated into smaller clusters of items (e.g., sirloin and round steak, chuck and round roast). 

Drawing on this survey of expenditure data, Runzheimer sorted the item groupings into the four main cost components
specified in the OPM regulations: Consumption Goods & Services, Transportation, Housing, and Miscellaneous
Expenses. Runzheimer observed that families in the lower income ranges spent more of their money, as a percentage
of total expenses, on goods and services and housing than families in higher income ranges. Also, families spent approximately
the same percentage of their total expenses on transportation, regardless of income. Consequently, the Miscellaneous
Expense component which includes such things as medical-care expenses, contributions, gifts to non-family members,
pension funds, long-term savings and investments, and life insurance premiums_increased as a percentage of total
expenses as income increased. 

To develop accurate and defensible weighing patterns for the three income levels, Runzheimer performed linear regression
analysis on the selected 1988 CES data. Listed below are the results of Runzheimer's analysis for the income ranges
listed on the preceding page: 



 


2.2 General Formulae and Applications 



An ``index'' is a mathematical way to compare one price (or set of data) with another. For example, if a price index for
a can of green beans is 110, that means that a can of green beans costs 10% more in the pricing area (i.e., allowance area)
than in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area). 

Runzheimer computed indexes for hundreds of items. To combine these indexes, Runzheimer applied weights from the
CES that reflected the relative amount consumers normally spend on the items. For example, the price of a can of green
beans has a lower weight than the price of a pound of apples because, according to the CES, people generally spend less
on canned green beans than on apples. 

Runzheimer employed an indexing methodology known as Laspeyres to derive total cost indexes for each of three income
levels and for each costed location. As applied to living-cost research, the Laspeyres index reflects the expenditure
patterns of the people in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area) to weight the prices. Because detailed
CES data by income level are not published for the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer used nationwide CES data to compute
weights. Consequently, Runzheimer did not technically apply the Laspeyres index methodology in its pure form. Nevertheless,
Runzheimer firmly believes that this nuance does not invalidate the price comparisons presented in this report.


As described in the example above and in greater detail in sections 3.2 and 6.2, Runzheimer applied the Laspeyres methodology
to compute price indexes for the Goods & Services and the Miscellaneous Expenses components, respectively.
For the Transportation and the Housing components, Runzheimer used a combination of a cost-build-up approach and
the Laspeyres methodology to compute component indexes.

In conformance with section 591.205(c), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Runzheimer followed a five-step process
to derive the overall total indexes for each allowance area. First, Runzheimer used the CES data and the income ranges
described in section 2.1.2.4 above to derive the amount of money consumers typically spend on each component at each
income level. These amounts appear in the table below and in Appendix 14. 







Second, for each allowance area, Runzheimer multiplied the values above by the component indexes for the allowance
area. Because the Housing component consisted of two indexes (one for owners and another for renters), we produced
two sets of total relative costs_one for owners and another for renters. 

Third, for each allowance area and income level, Runzheimer combined the total relative costs for owners and renters
using the proportion of owners and renters as identified in the CES to weigh the costs. (See section 4.2.1.) This produced
an overall, average, relative living cost at each income level in each allowance area. 

Fourth, for each allowance area, the overall, average relative costs by income level were combined using federal
employment weights based on the employment at each income level in the allowance area. Applying the same allowance-area
employment weights, Runzheimer computed an overall, average cost for the reference area. 

The last step was to divide the overall, average relative cost for the allowance area by the overall, average cost for
the reference area to produce the final index. (See Appendix 14 for the calculations for each index.) 



2.3 Data Collection Process 



As noted earlier, Runzheimer obtained price information on over 6,000 items from over 1,000 outlets. To accomplish
this important research effort, we selected the most efficient and effective information-gathering approaches
possible. This section describes the various approaches.

2.3.1 In-house Research Staff 



Runzheimer research personnel at its corporate headquarters in Rochester, Wisconsin, played a major role in all
data-collection activities. These professionals: 

 Contacted manufacturers, trade associations, governmental agencies, and retail establishments to ensure
that suitable items were selected and priced; 

 Contacted professionals in the real estate business in each of the costed locations to obtain general information
as well as specific rental rates and home market values; 

 Conducted pricing surveys on site and by telephone for many items; 

 Served as a liaison for field researchers; 

 Performed hundreds of quality control checks in conformance with editing rules communicated by Runzheimer
to OPM once the data had been collected (these checks often involved verification of the survey data through telephone
calls as well as comparing current data-gathering results with those from the 1992-1993 survey); and 

 Analyzed and computed the category, component and total comparative cost indexes. 



2.3.2 Field Researchers_``Research Associates'' 



Collection of most price data was best accomplished through personal visits to retail outlets (e.g., grocery, clothing,
automobiles). For these activities, Runzheimer hired residents of each allowance area as independent contractors
(``research associates''). For years, when measuring living costs for its clients, Runzheimer has applied this
approach to data collection in over 80 countries worldwide. 

To avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest, Runzheimer did not hire persons as research associates who were
either employees of the Federal Government, or who had immediate family who were employees of the Federal Government.




2.3.3 On-site Visits by Runzheimer Research Personnel 



Full-time Runzheimer research professionals travelled to selected allowance areas to supervise data-collection
activities and perform various quality-control checks on the data as necessary. Each such visit occurred during
the pricing period. 


The researchers visited living communities within the allowance areas to look at housing accommodations personally
and to talk with local real estate professionals. They also visited numerous retail outlets to verify item quality,
selection and price levels in general. 

In addition, these researchers met with Runzheimer's research associate(s) to answer any data-collection questions
and to provide any additional training and instruction as necessary. 



2.4 Editing and Quality Control Procedures 



Runzheimer's experience in measuring living-cost differences enabled us to establish editing and quality-control
procedures at all stages of collecting and analyzing data. All data provided by research associates were manually
reviewed by analysts prior to being entered into Runzheimer's computer system. Data elements were subsequently
checked through software programs. 

Federal regulations in section 591.205(b)(1)(i), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, state that, ``Whenever
possible, exact brands and models are priced in each location.'' Every effort was made to satisfy this objective.
(See section 3.3 for a discussion of brand and model selection.) Nevertheless, in a number of the allowance areas,
the exact brands and models were either not readily available or not available at all. In these instances, editing
decisions and substitutions were needed. 

Runzheimer defines ``editing'' as the removal and/or replacement of a price quote based on consistent and logical
criteria. In all areas, Runzheimer was concerned that items of lesser (or greater) quality than the item specified
might inadvertently be included in the analysis and bias the results. Therefore, any price quote that varied significantly
from other price quotes for the item was flagged, verified, and, if necessary, eliminated from the analysis. 

Removing an item from a location analysis causes redistribution of its weight to other items in its subcategory (or
category when no subcategory exists). Consequently, whenever possible, Runzheimer avoided removing an unpriced
item from a location analysis. When the review process revealed a missing price for an item, Runzheimer resurveyed
to obtain a price wherever possible. 



2.5 Pricing Surveys in Nome, Alaska 



There are four allowance areas in Alaska: Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, and the Rest of the State of Alaska. As was
done in previous surveys, Runzheimer surveyed living costs in Nome, Alaska to represent living costs in the Rest of
the State of Alaska allowance area. 

OPM selected Nome for survey beginning with the 1991/1992 surveys. According to OPM, Federal civilian employment
in Alaska is concentrated in the three main cities, and Federal employment outside these three cities is not concentrated
in any particular town or region. 

OPM believed that living-cost surveys in multiple places outside the major cities would not be practical. Therefore,
Nome was chosen because of its remote location, relative population size, and relative number of Federal civilian
employees in that area. 



2.6 Surveying the Washington, D.C., Area 



OPM defined the Washington, D.C., area in the federal regulations as the Washington DC-MD-VA Metropolitan
Statistical Area. Because federal employees who work in this area reside in Virginia, in Maryland, and in the District
of Columbia, Runzheimer selected retail outlets and living communities from all three. Runzheimer's model gave
equal weight to the average prices in each geographic area. 

Because of the size and diversity of the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer conducted substantially more pricing
surveys there than in other areas. For the Goods & Services component, Runzheimer generally surveyed to obtain
six times as many price quotes in the Washington, D.C., area as in the typical allowance area. For the Housing, Transportation
and Miscellaneous Expense components, data collection was generally triple that of the typical allowance area.

3. Consumption Goods & Services 



3.1 Component Overview 


Based on the CES data, the Goods & Services component consists of ten categories of family expense:

 

Food at Home 
Food Away from Home 
Tobacco 
Alcohol 
Furnishings & Household Operations 

Clothing
Domestic Services
Professional Services
Personal Care
Recreation





To aid in quality control and analysis of future pricings, Runzheimer further subdivided four of the largest categories_food
at home, furnishings and household operations, clothing, and recreation_into subcategories. Specific examples
of products and services from these four subdivided categories can be found below. These examples only represent
a minor portion of the total number of items (products and services) Runzheimer priced within each subdivided category.
(See Appendix 2 for a complete description of all marketbasket items.) 







From its ten categories of expense (which include the four subdivided categories above), Runzheimer selected a marketbasket
of items on which to base its goods and services analysis. A ``marketbasket'' is a selected group of products and services
that represent hundreds or even thousands of other items. Pricing every item available to consumers in a given locale
would be unnecessary, inefficient, and probably impossible. 
Runzheimer selected typically purchased items and weighted these according to their relative importance in terms
of consumer expenditure patterns. Each marketbasket item represented a specific group of related expense items.
Using CES data, we determined the relative importance (weight) of each item. We compared the average price of each
marketbasket item in each allowance area with the average price in the Washington, D.C., area. The price differences
(expressed as indexes) were aggregated based on the item, subcategory and category weightings, resulting in a total
Goods & Services component index at each income level.

<TEXT>
 

In 1991, OPM directed Runzheimer to include catalog pricing (including applicable shipping costs) to reflect this
common purchasing option in allowance areas. OPM identified items to survey based on comments received on the 1990
survey. Runzheimer identified items to survey that were either unavailable or difficult to find in each allowance
area. Together, OPM and Runzheimer agreed to survey eight marketbasket items by catalog. 
In each allowance area Runzheimer generally requested three price quotes for each item (and sometimes more than three)
from the local economy_one from each of three different outlets. 



3.2 Marketbasket Research 

3.2.1 Expenditure Research_Category Weightings 


Runzheimer tabulated the expense data from the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey according to the ten categories
of goods and services. As in the component analysis, Runzheimer used the expense data from the seven most appropriate
income ranges as input into a linear regression analysis. From that analysis, Runzheimer calculated the category
weightings for each income level as listed below: 







3.2.2 Expenditure Research_Subcategory and Item Weightings 


Runzheimer also drew upon the expense data from the 1988 CES to determine proper subcategory and item weightings and
to identify marketbasket items. Logical groupings of family expenditures provided the basis for subcategory and
item weights. Unlike category weightings, which vary by income level, subcategory and item weightings are computed
from national aggregate expenditures only (i.e., all three income levels used the same set of subcategory and item
weightings) as this approach is most common in similar private sector cost-of-living analyses. 
Runzheimer's expenditure research process included procedures to ensure that no marketbasket item had an overwhelmingly
large or insignificantly small item weighing. 



3.3 Marketbasket Item Specifications 


From each logical expense grouping, Runzheimer selected one or more marketbasket items to represent all items in
the grouping. When selecting specific items for the marketbasket, Runzheimer worked to satisfy these three criteria:


 Items should be readily available in all locations if possible or should be items of local significance (e.g.,
snow blower). 
 Item price levels should logically represent the price levels of unselected items in the ``logical grouping.''

 Items should have the same or nearly the same application in all locations. 
Appendix 2 lists Runzheimer's marketbasket items. Once an item was selected, Runzheimer's research analysts identified
the specific brand and/or model/size of each item available in all (or most) locations. For some items, this involved
contacting manufacturers, trade associations, retail establishments, etc. For other items, isolating specifications
was quite straight forward because of their nature (e.g., bread, sirloin steak, nonprescription pain reliever).
Appendix 3 identifies changes in the current items selected for pricing in the Goods & Services, Miscellaneous
Expense, and Housing Related categories, along with explanation for the changes.

3.3.1 Exchange and Commissary Expenditure Research 



Runzheimer used the same marketbasket items to price commissaries and exchanges as were used for the local pricings.
We obtained one price quote for each marketbasket item surveyed in these facilities. 

Runzheimer did not assume that people with access to military facilities made all purchases in these facilities.
Instead, we used OPM's 1980 Living Pattern Survey of federal employees to determine the percentage of purchases that
families typically make in military facilities versus local outlets. These percentages were used to aggregate the
local and commissary/exchange prices into one set of appropriate, blended prices. (The blended prices were compared
to the local prices in the Washington, D.C., area just as each allowance area's local prices were.)

3.4 Goods & Services Data Collection Procedures 

3.4.1 Data Collection Materials 



The living-cost surveys conform with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). 

Runzheimer collected data with OMB-approved data collection materials (see Appendix 5). All Runzheimer-developed
worksheets conformed to the OMB-approved materials. 



3.4.2 Outlet Selection 



Proper outlet selection is crucial to measuring living-cost differences accurately because misjudgment can seriously
affect survey results. Runzheimer paid particular attention to choosing appropriate outlets, focusing on three
key guidelines to ensure proper outlet selection. 

First, for areas that had numerous outlets from which to choose, Runzheimer identified targets in several different
geographic areas. For example, in the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer selected outlets in and around six different
geographic areas: that is, two areas in Virginia, two in Maryland and two in the District of Columbia. 

Runzheimer's second guideline was that for any one marketbasket item, all outlets be similar in type. For example,
Runzheimer surveyed two of the three food items in full-service grocery stores and the third food item in a warehouse-type
grocery store in all locations where such stores are found. Gathering prices from all warehouse-type stores in one
location and all full-service grocery stores in another would have distorted price comparisons. 

The last guideline involved the diversity of outlets in Runzheimer's sample. We believe that pricing different items
in different types of outlets more accurately portrays living-cost differences. For example, for efficiency, Runzheimer
could have priced all clothing items in department stores. However, to incorporate price levels at other types of
outlets that sell clothing items, whenever possible, Runzheimer surveyed some items in men's and women's clothing
stores, some items in department stores, other items in shoe stores and still other items in discount department stores.


Runzheimer's research analysts selected outlets on the basis of: 

 Personal experience of Runzheimer on-site research associates and travelling researchers; 

 Informal telephone interviews with knowledgeable residents in each area; 

 Yellow pages sections of area telephone books; 

 Area chambers of commerce and information bureaus; and 

 Experience gained from other surveys conducted by Runzheimer. 

With new businesses constantly appearing (and old ones disappearing), outlet selection will be an ongoing process.
Also, one can expect a portion of outlets to refuse to participate every year. Therefore, updating Runzheimer's outlet
sample is a necessary and important part of each pricing survey. 

An example of refining outlet selection for this year's survey is the attention paid to defining the distinguishing
differences between restaurants categorized as appropriate for family dining and those appropriate for fine dining.
OPM developed a matrix which defined such characteristics as menu selections, atmosphere, table setting, seating,
reservations, and AAA rating. This allowed Runzheimer researchers to compare apples to apples between the allowance
areas and the Washington D.C. area. Also, OPM established guidelines directing Runzheimer to survey 100% family
restaurants for breakfast, roughly 75% for lunch, and roughly 66% for dinner.

3.5 Inclusion of Sales and Excise Taxes 


For all items subject to sales tax, the appropriate amount of tax was added prior to analysis. Runzheimer gathered
applicable information on taxes by contacting appropriate sources of information in the allowance areas. Runzheimer
also drew upon appropriate tax publications, such as the State of Maryland's Sales and Use Tax Laws and Regulations
and the Uniform Sales Tax, ``Ordinance Section 69.05,'' of the City/Borough of Juneau. 


3.6 Goods & Services Survey Results 


In section 2.2 of this report, Runzheimer presented a detailed explanation of the economic model used to analyze the
price data. As it applies to Goods & Services, the approach involved comparing the average prices of marketbasket
items in each allowance area with those in the Washington, D.C., area. The resulting price ratios were aggregated
into subcategory and then category indexes using the expenditure weightings derived from the 1988 CES. 
In the area of professional services (accountant and legal fees), Runzheimer and OPM noted the existence of a relatively
few extreme values that were either exceptionally low or high cost. In situations such as this, statisticians frequently
use the median or trim the data in some manner to enhance reliability. Consequently, Runzheimer recommended that
the observations be ranked from low to high and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e.
eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were fewer than
five observations.) OPM agreed. These procedures reduce the influence of anomalies and make survey results more
stable from one year to the next. 
Appendix 4 contains tables showing the ten category indexes, the three weighing patterns, and the three total consumption
Goods & Services indexes for each allowance area. The Washington, D.C., area does not require a table because
it is, by definition, ``the reference location'' where all category and component indexes equal 100. 


4. Housing 


4.1 Component Overview 


The Housing component consists of expenses related to owning or renting a dwelling. These include: 
 mortgage or rent payments, 
 utilities, 
 real estate taxes, 
 homeowner's or renter's insurance, 
 home maintenance, and 
 telephone. 
At each of the three income levels, Runzheimer measured annual housing costs under the two main housing categories:
ownership and rental. 


4.2 Housing Model 
4.2.1 Expenditure Research 


Section 2.1.2.4 describes how Runzheimer analyzed the 1988 CES to identify the portion of expenses attributable
to each of the four components. Runzheimer also used this survey to determine the national average ratio of families
who own, as opposed to rent, their residences. Using the expense data from the seven most appropriate income ranges
as input into a linear regression analysis, Runzheimer calculated own and rent weights:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940831-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940831-2-00106 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Runzheimer excluded expenditure data for homeowning families without a mortgage because they were not typical of
homeowners in the base area or in the allowance areas with the largest concentrations of federal employees. 
The 1988 CES was also used to identify which home-maintenance items to price and to establish the relative importance
of those items. 


4.2.2 Development of Housing Profiles 


To compare housing costs accurately in all locations, Runzheimer constructed a model to measure housing costs under
six different circumstances; that is, we identified six typical housing profiles and matched these profiles to three
income levels, as shown in the table below. Runzheimer and OPM agreed that at least one criterion for the owner profile
should be the square footage of the home and at least one criterion for the renter profile should be the number of bedrooms
in the rental unit. The profiles for homeowners and renters are: 




4.2.3 Living Community Selection 


Runzheimer surveyed the same living communities for the Winter 1994 survey as it did for the winter survey portion
of the 1992/1993 study. To gather data, our researchers contacted real estate brokers, residential appraisers and
other knowledgeable real estate professionals in each area to obtain information on the predominant age(s), size(s)
and type(s) of housing in various communities and housing subdivisions. When available and appropriate, Runzheimer
identified at least six communities (two at each income level) in each allowance area. However, this goal was not achievable
in some of the smaller allowance areas. For the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer selected nine communities (three
at each income level) in which to gather renter and homeowner data. 
A table of living communities used for pricing can be found in Appendix 6. 


4.2.4 Identification and Quantification of Housing-Related Expenses 


From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer identified and categorized housing-related expense items into one of five groups:

 utilities, 
 real estate taxes, 
 owners/renters insurance, 
 maintenance, and 
 telephone. 


4.2.4.1 Utilities 


For this study, Runzheimer classified electric, heat (oil or gas), water and sewer as utilities. Although most utility
companies had ready access to current charges per unit of consumption and average consumption patterns for all households,
very few (if any) separated consumption patterns by number of family members in a household or by size/type of accommodation.

Runzheimer focused on average annual consumption experience per household, gathering this information from utility
companies serving each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area. Combining this consumption data with current
utility rates, Runzheimer computed average annual utility costs for each of electric, gas or oil (whichever Runzheimer
found to be more widely used, if used at all), water and sewer. Runzheimer then assigned this average consumption pattern
to the homeowner profile at the middle income level. 
Because some utility costs vary by size of house and yard, Runzheimer calculated a multiplier consistent with the
standard home sizes to arrive at utility rates for the other five profiles. The table below shows the standard sizes
and utility factors for each profile. The standard sizes roughly equate to the reference size of each profile. The
formula to calculate each multiplier was:



Multiplier = 1 + (.5  x  (Standard square feet_1300)/1300)

<TEXT>
 

The resulting utility multipliers are: 


 



4.2.4.2 Real Estate Taxes 



For this study, Runzheimer contacted the city assessor in each allowance area to obtain real estate tax information
on the selected living communities. Real estate tax formulas were obtained for most living communities. Actual or
representative tax amount paid were obtained in other communities. 



4.2.4.3 Owners/Renters Insurance 



As it did for previous surveys, Runzheimer undertook to gather insurance-rate information for the allowance areas
for both renter and owner profiles. These rates represent coverage for structure and contents for homeowners but
contents only for renters. 

Previous research conducted by Runzheimer, at the request of OPM, found that insurance coverage for disasters, such
as floods and earthquakes, is not prevalent in the allowance areas; consequently, Runzheimer, with the concurrence
of OPM, does not consider these additional riders. (See 

Report to OPM on Living Costs in Selected NonForeign Areas and in the Washington-D.C., Area, June 1992

 at 57 FR 58556). Runzheimer notes, however, that OPM is reviewing the results of the Federal Employee Housing and Living
Patterns Survey as they apply to this issue. 



4.2.4.4 Maintenance 



Many factors were involved in measuring the cost of maintaining a home, including area climate, architecture and
building materials, and the cost of maintenance materials and labor. As it did for the previous survey, Runzheimer
priced such household maintenance commodities as fire extinguisher, bathroom caulking and kitchen faucet. Pest
control service was priced in every allowance area except Nome, Alaska, where local sources indicated it wasn't necessary.


Runzheimer developed maintenance costs based on the cost of maintenance materials and labor rates in each area. Runzheimer's
approach to maintenance was the same as the approach to goods and services, as explained below. 

Runzheimer used expenditure data from the 1988 CES to identify the national average home-maintenance expense, the
maintenance items to survey, and the appropriate item weighing. Because most, if not all, maintenance items were
included in rent, maintenance costs were not added in the three renter profiles. 

To compute home-maintenance cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area for the
homeowner profiles, Runzheimer obtained prices for selected building materials and labor rates for maintenance
work. For each area, Runzheimer computed the relative cost (i.e., an index) for each maintenance item compared to
the cost of that item in the D.C. area. As with Goods & Services, the results of the nationwide CES were used to weight
these maintenance indexes into an overall index for each area. 

To combine maintenance indexes with the other homeowner costs, which were expressed in dollar amounts, Runzheimer
converted the indexes to dollars. To do this, Runzheimer multiplied the maintenance cost index for each area by the
CES nationwide average maintenance cost and assigned that cost to the middle-income homeowner profile. 

Logically, maintenance costs for larger homes would be greater than costs for middle-sized homes, while costs for
smaller homes would be less. Therefore, in this study, Runzheimer applied the same homeowner multipliers used in
the utilities model for the lower and upper income profiles (.85 and 1.15 respectively) to recognize differences
in maintenance costs due to house size. 



4.2.4.5 Telephone 



Telephone expenses consisted of local service charges, possible additional charges for local calls, and charges
for long distance calls. To measure estimated expenses for local service and local calls, where available, Runzheimer
surveyed the cost of touch-tone service with unlimited calling. 

To estimate long distance charges in all areas, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of three ten-minute direct dial calls
per month to large U.S. mainland cities (i.e., Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City). Runzheimer measured the price
of a call placed in the survey area at the time of day necessary to be received in the respective city at 8:00 p.m. local
time. In many areas, this resulted in pricing a combination of daytime and evening-rate calls.

4.3 Housing Data Collection Procedures 



As was done in previous years, Runzheimer collected housing information from a variety of sources. Also as in previous
years, Runzheimer research personnel traveled to profiled communities in the allowance areas to observe first hand
the comparability of homes in one area versus another and the appropriateness of individual housing units for the
profiled income level. 

In previous surveys, OPM required several additional steps to increase the quantity and quality of housing data collected.
These extra steps were again taken this year and included purchasing data from additional real estate listing services,
making greater use of assessor's records when other data were not available, and contacting more real estate professionals
to obtain additional home sales, rental data, and market trend information. 




4.3.1 Homeowner Data Collection 



In the homeowner data-gathering phase, Runzheimer obtained sale prices of homes (called ``comparable sales'')
in the area that matched the housing profiles. In the communities that were identified (see section 4.2.3), Runzheimer
tried to obtain all the comparable sales during the 6-month period prior to the date of the survey. For the winter surveys,
the pricing period was July 1993 through February 1994. 

As was done last year, Runzheimer contacted knowledgeable and helpful real estate professionals in each location
and/or used real estate sales data and listing services. The amount of data obtained depended on the number of home
sales in the community and the availability of square footage and other information. This in turn depended on the size
of the community, the economic conditions, the quality and quantity of the realty data available, and the willingness
and ability of local realty professionals and assessor offices to provide data. If the comparable sales data obtained
from the first data sources were insufficient, Runzheimer contacted additional data sources in the area to attempt
to secure more sales data, if practical. 



4.3.2 Renter Data Collection 



In some cases, the same realtors and brokers who assisted in our profiling phase were very active in the rental markets
as well. When this occurred, Runzheimer obtained current rental rates and fees for our profiled apartments, townhouses
and houses from these sources. 

Runzheimer also contacted rental management firms that operated apartment complexes matching the profile specifications.
In large metropolitan areas, such as the Washington, DC, area where rental complexes abound, our housing analysts
conducted telephone surveys to obtain current rental information. 


Rental data were obtained from a variety of sources, e.g., brokers, property managers, newspaper advertisements,
and other listings. Analyses of these data revealed what appeared to be two separate rental markets_a broker market
and a non-broker market. Rental rates and estimates provided by brokers generally exceeded those obtained from other
sources. 

In each area, the quantity of data obtained from either source-type varied significantly. Therefore, analyzing
all of the rental data (both broker and non-broker) together for an area and income level was undesirable. Because
OPM has no information on how federal employees who rent generally secure their lodgings, OPM requested that Runzheimer
apply equal weights to the broker and non-broker data to compute the overall average rental rate for the area and income
level. (See Appendix 9B.) 




4.4 Housing Analysis 


4.4.1 Homeowner Data Analysis 



One of the most important factors relating to the price of a home is the number of square feet of living space. For each
income profile in each allowance area and the Washington, DC, area, Runzheimer computed that average price per square
foot for the comparables. Runzheimer used this value times the reference square footage for the profile to determine
the average home value for the profile. 



4.4.1.1 Data Trimming 



OPM requested that Runzheimer continue to apply the special procedures developed during the 1992/1993 surveys.
In 1992/1993, based on experience from the previous home-pricing surveys, OPM modified the living-cost model as
it applied to the analysis of housing data. The modifications allow the use of housing costs trend data as well as current
housing costs in the analysis of owner and renter living costs. These analyses are consistent with section 591.205(b)(3)
of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and result in improved housing data results. 

One of the modifications involves ``trimming'' the observations. In past surveys, Runzheimer and OPM noted that
a relatively few extreme values (values that were either exceptionally low or high cost) could have a significant
influence on the average housing costs observed at an income level within an area. Including these extreme values
had the potential to cause results to vary erratically from one year to the next. 

In situations such as this, statisticians frequently use the median or trim the data in some manner to reduce its volatility.
The use of the median home value was not desirable because some areas had relatively sparse data at one or more income
levels. This could make the median unstable from one year to the next.

<TEXT>
 

In the 1992/1993 surveys, Runzheimer recommended, and OPM agreed, that the observations be ranked from low to high
on the basis of the cost per square foot and that the top and bottom 20 percent of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e.,
eliminated) from the sample before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were fewer
than five observations.) These procedures reduce the influence of home sales anomalies and make survey results more
stable from one year to the next. 



4.4.1.2 Special Considerations 



The new procedures also involved analyzing data in a more thorough and integrated manner. The procedures required
analyzing the current housing survey data, analyzing the trends observed when these data were compared with the previous
survey's data, and comparing these trends with the views obtained from real estate professionals in the area. How
and which data were used depended on the quality and quantity of data collected and how the trends observed agreed among
income levels and with the views of local real estate professionals. These procedures are discussed below. 

Runzheimer sought to gather all of the appropriate comparable sales data available in each area. As a minimum, Runzheimer
sought to obtain 10 realtor sales per community per income level or 20 per income level per area. In many areas, the sales
data exceeded the minimum. 

If the minimum number could not be obtained or if highly divergent trend data were observed among income levels in the
area or as compared with the views of local real estate professionals, additional analyses were performed. These
analyses were: 

1. If the current data were significantly better than the previous data (e.g., greater in quantity or more consistent),
the current data were used to the extent practical. 

2. If at least three observations at each income level were available, and the previous data were better than the current
data or the previous and current data were of equivalent quality, the change (i.e., trend) in the average price was
used to update the previous data. This was done using one of the following procedures, depending on the situation:

a. If data problems occurred at one income level only, the average rate of change at the other two income levels was used
to adjust the previous prices for the affected income level. 
b. If data problems occurred in two income levels, the rate of change observed at the non-problem income level was used
to adjust the previous prices for the two affected income levels. 
c. If data problems occurred at all income levels, the average rate of change observed at all three income levels was
used to adjust the previous prices at all income levels. 
3. If fewer than three observations were available at any income level and/or the data quality was questionable at
all levels, all three levels of current and previous survey data were merged. These data were then analyzed by applying
the procedures described in section 4.4.1 above to each set of merged data, and the average cost per square foot was
computed for each set of data and compared to estimate the overall change in the area. This overall change was applied
to the previous average costs by income level to determine the current costs at each income level for the area. 
The areas for which these procedures were applied and the calculations used are found in Appendix 9A. 



4.4.2 Rental Data Analysis 


Runzheimer assigned each rental quote data point to a single income level, based on these criteria: 
 Assign one bedroom apartments to the lower income level. 
 Assign two bedroom apartments to the middle income level. 
 Assign townhouses and detached houses with a minimum of two bedrooms to the upper income level. 



4.4.2.1 Data Trimming and Special Analyses 


In the analysis of rental data, Runzheimer applied the same procedures used to trim the home sales data (see section
4.4.1.1) except that data were ranked on the basis of monthly rental rates, not cost per square foot. Also, as with home
sales analyses, special analyses were applied to rental data when the data were sparse or highly divergent trends
were observed among income levels. These analyses were the same as those applied to home sales data (see section 4.4.1.2)
except that if data were merged, overall estimates were based on monthly rental rates, not the cost per square foot.
(See Appendix 9B for these analyses.)

4.4.3 Analysis of Housing-Related Expenses 


Because section 4.2.4 covers the identification and quantification of housing-related expenses, these topics
are not repeated here. 
However, it should be noted that Runzheimer incorporated home sale prices from this study into the calculations of
real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance, which depend upon the value of the home. 



4.5 Housing Survey Results 


In the above sections, Runzheimer describes how it measured the costs for maintenance, insurance, utilities, real
estate taxes, rents, and homeowner mortgages. Appendix 7 shows the cost of each of these items, for renters and homeowners
separately, in each allowance area and in the Washington, DC, area. 
Appendix 8 compares the total cost of these items in each allowance area with the total cost of the same items in the Washington,
DC, area. Again, there are separate comparisons for renters and homeowners. 
The final housing-cost comparisons take the form of indexes that are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total, overall
index for owners and renters. (Refer to section 2.2 for a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes
are combined.) 


5. Transportation 



5.1 Component Overview 


The Transportation component consisted of expenses related to private and public transportation. The private transportation
category contained expenses related to owning and operating a vehicle in each area. The public transportation category
focused on the cost of air fares from each location to a common point within the contiguous 48 states. 
As was done in previous surveys, Runzheimer used national average expenditure data to combine the private and public
transportation relative cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, DC, area to arrive at a
total Transportation component index. 



5.2 Private Transportation Methodology 


Runzheimer determined that an accurate and reasonable approach to measure transportation costs was to select and
analyze three commonly driven vehicles (a domestic auto, an import auto and a utility vehicle) in all areas.
New vehicles were the basis for developing the transportation-cost calculations. Although Runzheimer could have
developed costs from the premise that ``identical'' used vehicles would be purchased from auto dealers in each location,
Runzheimer believed that costing new vehicles reduced the potential for inconsistencies due to value judgements
concerning used vehicles. 



5.2.1 Vehicle Selection and Pricing 


As mentioned above, Runzheimer selected and priced a domestic auto, an import auto, and a utility vehicle as the basic
vehicle types to cost in all locations. We based our selection of these vehicle types on their popularity in the United
States as demonstrated by owner registration data. 
To select a specific make and model within each vehicle type, Runzheimer identified the top-selling models in each
car class. For these models, Runzheimer's research associates collected new vehicle prices. 
At each auto dealership in the sample, Runzheimer recorded the suggested retail prices of the three vehicles plus
any additional charges, such as shipping, excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. Runzheimer used
the suggested retail prices (not negotiated prices) in the analysis. Runzheimer also included documentation fees
as part of the new-vehicle costs in Alaskan locations. Contacted dealerships explained that a documentation fee
is charged on a new-car purchase to cover paperwork costs.

<TEXT>
 

Runzheimer did not include a fee for the Washington, D.C., area because dealers in those areas do not typically charge
a documentation fee. 

The three vehicles selected for analysis were: 




Domestic Vehicle_Ford Taurus GL 4-door sedan 3.0L 6 cyl 

Utility Vehicle_Chevrolet S10 Blazer 4X4 2 door 4.3L 6 cyl 

Import Vehicle_Honda Civic DX 4-door sedan 1.5L 4 cyl 




Runzheimer priced 1994 models. 



All vehicles were equipped with standard options, such as automatic transmission, AM/FM stereo radio and air conditioning.
As done in the 1992/1993 survey, at OPM's request, Runzheimer also priced snow tires, engine-block heaters, and heavy-duty
batteries in all of the Alaskan locations. 

Car dealers in the Washington, D.C., area did not recommend vehicle rustproofing. However, it was suggested or recommended
in allowance areas. Therefore, we included rustproofing as an add-on in all allowance areas, but not in the Washington,
D.C., area. 



5.2.2 Vehicle Trade Cycle 



Calculating the cost to own and operate a vehicle requires that two important factors be determined: miles driven
and time period of ownership. In the automobile industry, these two factors are known collectively as a vehicle's
``trade cycle.'' The trade cycle is stated as a length of time either in months or years, and the total number of miles
driven in that time period (e.g., four-year, 60,000-mile trade cycle). This information is required to compute annual
costs related to fuel, oil, tires, maintenance and depreciation. 

Conforming with previous living-cost reports, Runzheimer used a four-year 60,000-mile trade cycle in all areas
based upon the following information: 
 The Internal Revenue Service has used this trade cycle for many years to compute the allowable cents-per-mile
reimbursement rate for persons who drive their personal vehicle for business purposes. 

 The four-year time period coincides with the typical length of a vehicle loan. 

 U.S. Department of Energy statistics for 1988 show that the U.S. average for number of vehicle miles driven
was: 18,595 per household and 10,246 miles per vehicle. 

Runzheimer has been unable to find conclusive statistics on average annual miles driven per vehicle in any allowance
area. In 1991, Runzheimer contacted car dealers to obtain their observations on average odometer mileage on trade-in
vehicles and informally asked other residents of each area for their opinions. 

From the opinions gathered, we concluded that, in most cases, the average annual miles driven in allowance locations
appeared to be less than or equal to 15,000. In the Washington, D.C., area, the opinions of those contacted indicated
an average annual mileage of 15,000 or more. Therefore, without definitive statistics to prove otherwise, Runzheimer
set a standard used in all reports to date of 15,000 miles per year, which results in a four-year, 60,000-mile trade
cycle. 



5.2.3 Fuel Performance and Type 



To establish average fuel-performance ratings, Runzheimer selected the ``city driving'' figures published by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Runzheimer chose the ``city'' instead of ``highway'' figures because
all locations contained considerable stop-and-go driving conditions. All vehicles included in this study used
regular unleaded fuel. Except in Alaska, Runzheimer obtained self-service cash prices and substituted full-service
when self-service was not available. At OPM's request, Runzheimer priced gasoline at the full-service pump in Alaska.


As in its second report to OPM, Runzheimer has included in its analysis a number of fuel-performance factors; specifically,
temperature, road surface, and gradient. Based on our research of these three factors, Runzheimer analysts developed
fuel-performance adjustment percentages in each allowance area. 



5.2.3.1 Impact of Temperature Upon Fuel Performance 



Runzheimer consulted two published sources to develop its adjustment percentages for this fuel-efficiency factor:
Passenger Car Fuel Economy: EPA and Road and The Weather Almanac (Ruffner & Blair). Miles-per-gallon performance
varies by ambient temperature. The lower the temperature, the fewer miles-per-gallon achieved and vice versa. In
the EPA study, the temperature at which no adjustments to fuel performance occur is 77
 F. Below that temperature, miles-per-gallon achieved drops; above 77
 , miles-per-gallon achieved improves. To measure the effect temperature has on miles-per-gallon for each
allowance area, Runzheimer researched average monthly temperatures as reported in The Weather Almanac. 

In each location and for each month, Runzheimer assigned the appropriate shortfall factor from the EPA study based
on the average monthly temperature for each given location. For example, if the average monthly temperature was 35
 , the shortfall factor in miles-per-gallon would be 0.876. After assigning factors to each month, Runzheimer
averaged the twelve factors for each location. The results of these calculations are shown in section 5.2.3.4.

5.2.3.2 Impact of Road Surface Upon Fuel Performance 



For its analysis, Runzheimer assumed that federally controlled roadways are typically composed of concrete and/or
high-load asphalt and that locally controlled roadways are typically composed of low-load asphalt. EPA's research
indicates that cars are generally more fuel-efficient on the firmer, high-load surfaces than on the softer, low-load
surfaces. 

Although traffic patterns and road usage certainly vary among areas, Runzheimer could find no relevant studies of
these issues. Therefore, Runzheimer assumed that federally controlled roadways generally support twice the traffic
of or are used at least twice as much as locally controlled roadways. 

In each allowance area, Runzheimer researched the total mileage falling into either the federal or local categories.
For example, Alaska contains 5,512 miles of federally controlled roads and 7,120 miles of locally controlled roads.
The usage assumption allowed Runzheimer to increase federal road mileage by a factor of two. 

Runzheimer applied the average low-load asphalt factor (which reflects dry, wet, and snowy conditions) to the local
mileage percentage and the average concrete and/or high-load asphalt factor to the federal mileage percentage to
create a weighted average factor for each area. These weighted factors for Alaska ranged from 0.94 to 0.97. The Washington,
D.C., area was assigned a factor of 1.00 on the premise that the vast majority of traffic in that area travels on dry,
high-load surfaces. (See section 5.2.3.4 for application of this factor in estimating overall miles-per-gallon.)




5.2.3.3 Impact of Gradient Upon Fuel Performance 



Runzheimer consulted EPA's Passenger Car Fuel Economy: EPA and Road to determine the effect of local topography (i.e.,
gradient) upon fuel efficiency. EPA provides mileage factors based upon various gradients ranging from less than
0.5% (essentially flat) to greater than 6% (steep). 

Runzheimer reviewed the topographic features of each area and found a wide range of road conditions. However, Runzheimer
was unable to find information on the types of terrain drivers typically encounter in each area or the number of miles
drivers travel in each type of terrain. 

Lacking such information, Runzheimer assumed that drivers in the allowance areas generally travel roads having
approximately the same gradients that are found on average in the United States. Applying the information from EPA's
research, Runzheimer computed a fuel-performance factor of 0.981 for this type of driving. This factor was assigned
to each allowance area. Runzheimer assigned a factor of 1.00 to the Washington, D.C., area on the premise that the vast
majority of traffic in that area travels on major freeways and highways that are relatively flat. (See section 5.2.3.4
for application of this factor in estimating overall fuel efficiency.) 



5.2.3.4 Overall Impact Upon Fuel Performance 



Runzheimer applied the results of the analyses described above to ``localize'' or make geographically sensitive
adjustments to the EPA average ratings and establish reasonable fuel-performance ratings for each allowance area.


In the table below, the factor 1.00 means that no adjustment to EPA fuel performance is appropriate. A factor of less
than 1.00 means that the estimated gasoline mileage in the area is less than the EPA average. For example, the total
adjustment factor for Fairbanks/Nome is 0.80. This means that the estimated gasoline mileage in Fairbanks and Nome
is 80% of the EPA estimated average. Note that the adjustment factor for the Washington, D.C., area (0.94) indicates
that average gasoline mileage in that area is below the EPA estimate also.

5.2.4 Vehicle Maintenance 


With OPM's concurrence, Runzheimer selected the five most common maintenance service/repair jobs performed on
vehicles as the basis for vehicle maintenance analysis: 
 tune-up, 
 oil change, 
 automatic transmission fluid change, 
 flush/fill coolant, and 
 muffler installation. 
Automobile manufacturers' recommended maintenance schedules were used to determine the frequency of performing
each of these maintenance jobs. Maintenance schedules vary, depending on the driving conditions typically encountered.
Consistent with the assumptions used for fuel economy and tire mileage, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions
in the allowance areas were generally severe and used the maintenance schedules that reflected that kind of driving.
For the D.C. area, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions were normal and used the maintenance schedules that
reflected that kind of driving. 
The recommended frequency of performing each of these jobs was combined with the prices charged by local dealers and
service stations to compute an estimated annual maintenance expense. 
For Alaska, Runzheimer included constant velocity (CV) joint boots as well. Runzheimer's research of CV joint boot
replacement revealed varying replacement cycles between Alaskan allowance areas: Anchorage_every 45,000 miles
(3 years), Fairbanks_every 15,000 miles (1 year), Juneau_every 45,000 miles (3 years) and Nome_every 30,000 miles
(2 years). The cost of replacement for all three vehicle types has been factored into the indexes based upon the life
cycle of the replacement. For example, 100% of the cost was included for Fairbanks because research indicated annual
replacement was the norm. Only 50% of the cost was included for Nome where research indicated bi-annual replacement.




5.2.5 Tires 


Research previously conducted by Runzheimer for OPM (see the June 1992 report) revealed that various factors (e.g.,
road quality/state of repair, road composition) caused tread life (the average number of miles a tire is expected
to last) to be less in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C., area. Based on these findings (some of which were
quantitative), Runzheimer based tire expenses on a 40,000-mile tread-life in allowance areas, and a 55,000-mile
tread-life in the Washington, D.C., area. 
Runzheimer's research also indicated that four extra snow tires, with studs, would be required for all three vehicles
in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. For Nome, Runzheimer's research revealed that mud and snow tires would be appropriate
for the S10 Blazer but not the other two vehicles because all-season radials were reported to be the norm. (Most of the
driving in Nome occurs within a very confined area). Therefore, as with the previous survey, Runzheimer surveyed
the cost of extra wheels, extra tires, and installing studs for all vehicles in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau and
the additional cost of mud and snow tires for the S10 Blazer in Nome. 



5.2.6 License and Registration Fees, and Miscellaneous Tax 


Runzheimer obtained information regarding appropriate license and registration fees, and miscellaneous taxes
(i.e., personal property tax and motor vehicle registration tax) from each area. One-time fees and miscellaneous
taxes were divided equally over each vehicle's four-year trade cycle. Sales and excise taxes were included in the
purchase price of each vehicle (see section 5.2.7.). Ongoing fees and taxes were included as part of the annual costs.




5.2.7 Depreciation 


From Runzheimer's experience, the single largest annual expense related to owning and operating newer vehicles
is vehicle depreciation, the lost value of the vehicle as it ages and is driven. To calculate average annual depreciation,
Runzheimer divides the difference between the purchase price and the residual value by the number of years the vehicle
is owned. 
In the depreciation equation, Runzheimer used suggested retail prices, plus any additional charges, such as shipping,
excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. (Runzheimer did not believe that negotiated prices could
be collected on an equitable basis.) As discussed earlier, the trade cycle was determined to be four years, 60,000
miles. Runzheimer research indicated that residual values were the same in all areas except Fairbanks and Nome. This
research effort is explained below. 
Runzheimer is aware that several firms and associations track and publish weekly or monthly used-car and used-truck
wholesale auction prices. Some firms even publish projections of the future value of today's new vehicles. Most publications
provide several residual values for each vehicle, depending on its condition at the time of trade-in (e.g., clean,
average, rough). Several common publications of this type are 

Black Book, Kelley Blue Book, Automotive Market Report, 

and 

NADA 

(National Automobile Dealers Association). Unfortunately, these sources only track prices for vehicles sold in
the contiguous 48 states and then publish broad-based average residual values for each vehicle. 
To get specific information from sources knowledgeable about the used vehicle markets in allowance areas, Runzheimer
contacted auto dealers and financial institutions in these areas. Most of the sources with whom Runzheimer spoke
said that they used the above-mentioned publications as guides, just as dealers and financial institutions across
the United States used them. 
Except for Fairbanks and Nome, Runzheimer found no conclusive evidence that used vehicles in allowance areas were
(on average) worth more or less than used vehicles in the Washington, D.C., area. Therefore, we reported the same used
vehicle prices in all areas (except Fairbanks and Nome). An appropriate and logical source for these values was the
October 1993 issue of 

Black Book Official Finance/Lease Guide 

for 1994 vehicles. For Fairbanks and Nome, Runzheimer used 90% of the 

Black Book 

projected residual values to reflect rougher conditions. 
It should be noted for clarification that identical residual values did not translate into identical depreciation
amounts in all locations. Depreciation amounts were higher in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C., area
because new vehicle prices in all allowance areas were higher. 



5.2.8 Finance Expense 


Runzheimer included the average annual cost of financing a vehicle in the total cost of private transportation. Runzheimer
surveyed banks in all areas for their auto-loan interest rates, using a 48-month loan length with 80% financing as
the basis in all locations.

5.2.9 Vehicle Insurance 


Runzheimer measured the cost of auto insurance in each location. To determine the type of coverage to price, Runzheimer
contacted insurance agents in each area to obtain information on the typical policy. Listed below are the most common
coverages, limits, and deductibles for the surveyed living-cost areas. 



Bodily Injury_$100,000/$300,000 
Property Damage_$50,000 
Medical_$5,000 
Uninsured Motorist_$100,000/$300,000 
Comprehensive_$100 Deductible 
Collision_$250 Deductible 



In all areas, Runzheimer attempted to identify the most ``popular'' automobile insurance companies by analyzing
market-share reports compiled by an industry rating bureau. The policy described above was then priced again this
year for each location. Two or three price quotes were obtained for each area and averaged together to produce the final
number for this component in each allowance area. 



5.3 Public Transportation Methodology 


As was done last year, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of air fares as they relate to recreational travel. Runzheimer
priced the lowest available round-trip air fare from each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles,
California. Los Angeles was selected because it is a common point approximately equidistant from most of the allowance
areas and the Washington, D.C., area. The cost of the trip from each allowance area to Los Angeles was compared with
the cost of the trip from the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles to compute the public transportation category indexes.
(See Appendix 11.) 



5.4 Transportation Survey Results 


Runzheimer measured the costs for fuel, maintenance and oil, tires, licensing, taxes, depreciation, finance, and
insurance for three types of automobiles in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area to determine typical
private transportation costs. Appendix 10 shows the cost of each of these items in each area. 
Runzheimer also measured the cost of recreational air travel from each allowance area and from the Washington, D.C.,
area to a common point within the contiguous 48 states. Appendix 11 shows the cost of these air fares and their relationship
to the cost for the Washington, D.C., area. 

Appendix 11 compares the total cost of the private transportation items for each vehicle in each allowance area with
the total cost of the same items in the Washington, D.C., area. Appendix 11 also shows how the private and public transportation
indexes were combined using expenditure weights derived from the CES data to produce final transportation indexes.

The final transportation indexes are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total overall index. (Refer to section 2.2 for
a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes are combined.)

6. Miscellaneous Expenses 



6.1 Component Overview 


The Miscellaneous Expense component consists primarily of four unrelated groups of expenses: 
 medical care, 
 contributions (including gifts to non-family members), 
 personal insurance, and 
 savings and investments (including pensions). 
Runzheimer believes that certain miscellaneous expense items should not affect living-cost measures between locations.
For example, Runzheimer considers charitable contributions a personal choice, so we include this expenditure as
a constant amount in all locations. Based on research into all of the expenses of this component, Runzheimer also regards
expenses related to personal insurance, savings and investments, and pensions as constants, for reasons discussed
in section 6.2.2. 
To measure the miscellaneous expenses, Runzheimer constructed a pricing methodology similar to the one used in the
Goods & Services component. Runzheimer selected representative items for medical care, priced them in all areas,
and then computed a Miscellaneous Expense component index based on the relative importance of costed items and categories
held constant. 



6.2 Miscellaneous Expense Model 
6.2.1 Expenditure Research 


From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer tabulated the miscellaneous expense data into logical expense groupings and then determined
the appropriate item weighing. The table on the following page lists the categories that Runzheimer selected to price
and their weights: 








6.2.2 Miscellaneous Expense Methodology 


As stated in section 2.2, Runzheimer used the Laspeyres indexing methodology to compute the Miscellaneous Expense
component index. For groups of items held constant, the model assumed a price ratio between the allowance area and
the Washington, D.C., area equal to 100.00%. 
Runzheimer defined personal insurance and pensions as the portion of a family's budget that was targeted for long-term
financial security. This is consistent with the definitions used by the CES, the results of which are used as weights
in the COLA model. In the CES, money stored in a savings or investment vehicle for future expenditures (of goods and
services, housing, or transportation) is accounted for in the other component weightings. 
In section 6.1, we noted that expenses related to personal insurance were held constant for all locations. This was
based on information received from life insurance companies and OPM officials. The life insurance companies contacted
indicated that policies written (and premiums charged) to persons within the United States and its territories did
not vary due to location. Runzheimer's research and discussions with OPM officials also indicated that, in general,
federal employees in all areas received similar or identical benefits packages_any variations were due to personal
preference. Therefore, Runzheimer believed, and OPM concurred, that holding these types of expenses constant was
appropriate.

6.3 Miscellaneous Expense Data Collection Procedures 


Medical care items were surveyed consistent with the approach used in the Goods & Services component. For quality-control
purposes, Runzheimer used its in-house research staff to conduct much of this survey. 
The following medical-care items were priced in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area: 
 nonprescription pain reliever 
 prescription drugs 
 vision check 
 dental service 
 doctor visit 
 hospital room 
 health insurance 
Runzheimer computed a Medical Care subcategory price index for each item in each allowance area by comparing each
local average price with the Washington, D.C., area average prices. These indexes were combined using weights derived
from the CES to compute a Medical Care subcategory index for each allowance area. 



6.4 Miscellaneous Expense Survey Results 


Appendix 12 contains the results of our data collection and index calculations. As the appendix shows, the relative
costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Expense Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore,
the Miscellaneous Component index reflects living-cost differences among areas. The cost of only two items_life
insurance/pensions and contributions_does not differ among areas. Although these two items together have a significant
weight, one should keep in mind that the Miscellaneous Component has the smallest weight of the four components. 
Section 2.2 describes how the Miscellaneous Expense component indexes are combined with the other component indexes
to derive the final index for each area. 


7. Final Results 



7.1 Total Comparative Cost Indexes 


The total comparative cost indexes appear below. Appendix 14 shows how each index was derived from the component indexes.








7.2 General Comments 


Runzheimer's primary goal throughout its work on each study has been to bring fairness and accuracy to the results.
The scope of this multi-year engagement has become more comprehensive by virtue of special research projects, seasonal
pricings, expanded marketbasket pricings and other efforts. Runzheimer believes that living-cost research is
a dynamic process, not a static one, and that fresh research and analysis will enhance further the quality of the survey
and the findings. Moreover, we believe that planned, ongoing interaction with OPM will aid the process and improve
accuracy. 



7.3 Recommendations 


As noted earlier in this report, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes in the living-cost
surveys and analyses. We believe that the research will show that income taxes represent a significant portion of
living expenses_a portion that varies from one area to the next. 

As also noted in the report, Runzheimer recognizes that it applied the same salary levels and CES data this year as it
did in the 1990 surveys. We commend OPM for introducing new federal employment weights and urge OPM to continue with
its plans to introduce gradually new CES data and salary levels in future surveys.

Nonforeign Area Cost-of-Living Allowances 
Price Survey Data Collection Procedures 



Survey Description 


The following information will be provided to the participants verbally or in writing. Participants who are familiar
with the program and the survey may be provided with less information as appropriate. 


Purpose


The Federal Government pays Cost-Of-Living-Allowances (COLA) in Alaska, Hawaii, and certain U.S. territories
and possessions. Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation,
and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington DC area.
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program. 


Data Collection


OPM, or its representatives, conducts annual Price Surveys to determine living cost differences. Local governments,
retail outlets, realty firms, and businesses providing professional and other services to be surveyed are identified
through the use of full-scale Background Surveys, conducted approximately once every five years. Participation

Nonforeign Area Cost-of-Living Allowances Background Survey Data Collection Procedures



Survey Description



The following information will be provided to the participants verbally or in writing. Participants who are familiar
with the program and the survey may be provided with less information as appropriate. 



Purpose 



The Federal Government pays Cost-Of-Living-Allowances (COLA) in Alaska, Hawaii, and certain U.S. territories
and possessions. Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation,
and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington, DC, area.
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program. OPM, or its representative,
conducts annual surveys to determine living cost differences. OPM conducts full-scale Background Surveys approximately
once every five years to review the appropriateness of items, services, and businesses covered in the annual Price
surveys. Elements of the Background Survey may be repeated annually on a limited basis as part of the maintenance of
and preparation for the annual Price Surveys. 

OPM uses the Background Survey to identify the services, items, quantities, outlets, and locations that will be surveyed
to collect living cost data within the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The Background Survey also is
used to collect information on local trade practices, consumer buying patterns, taxes and fees, and other economic
characteristics related to living costs. 



Data Collection 



Full-scale Background Surveys are conducted approximately once every five years. OPM identifies major manufacturers,
local governments, retail outlets, realty firms, and businesses providing professional services to be surveyed
on the basis of business volume and local prominence. Participation is voluntary. Data are collected by telephone
and/or personal interview. 



Confidentiality 



All data collected are used only for the purposes described above. The Government pledges to hold all micro or ``raw''
data collected in confidence. Names of participating businesses and institutions may be released. Names of individuals
are not released. Summary data will be made available to the public only to the extent that micro data cannot be associated
with data sources. 



Public Burden Information 



Public burden reporting for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 5 minutes to 30 minutes per response.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestion
for reducing this burden to Reports and Forms Management Officer, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street,
N.W., Room CHP 500, Washington, DC, 20415; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project
(3206-0199), Washington, DC, 20503.
