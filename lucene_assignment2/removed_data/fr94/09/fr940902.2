may request, in accordance with  353.22 or 355.22 of the Department of Commerce (the Department) Regulations
(19 CFR 353.22/355.22 (1993)), that the Department conduct an administrative review of that antidumping or countervailing

<TEXT>
 

In accordance with   353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the regulations, an interested party may request in writing
that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must specify
for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a review,
and the requesting party must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or resellers.
If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer if that
producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin, and
each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which reseller(s)
and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.
Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, Room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with  353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the regulations,
a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.
The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review,'' for requests received
by September 30, 1994. If the Department does not receive, by September 30, 1994, a request for review of entries covered
by an order or finding listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs
Service to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond
for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal
from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.
This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

<DOCTITLE>Fabric Expanded Neoprene Laminate From Japan, Revocation of the Antidumping Duty Order </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order
on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
On July 1, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 33955) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan
(July 19, 1985). 
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under  353.2(k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded
neoprene laminate from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this
antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 


Scope of the Order 


Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 5602.10.00, 5906.91.20, 5906.91.25,
5906.99.20, 5906.99.25, 5911.10.20. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written
description remains dispositive. 


This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994. Entries made during the period July 1, 1993 through
June 30, 1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct
the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated
antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Additions to the Procurement List.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List 
military resale commodities and services to be furnished by 
nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other 
severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 24, July 8 and 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From 
People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 
FR 32686, 35112 and 36168) of proposed additions to the 
Procurement List. 


After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
military resale commodities and services, fair market price, and 
impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, 
the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities 
and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
military resale commodities and services to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the military resale commodities and 
services. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the military resale commodities and services to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the military resale 
commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement 
List. 
Accordingly, the following military resale commodities and 
services are hereby added to the Procurement List:

<DOCTITLE>Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); Demonstration Project in Europe</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a CHAMPUS demonstration project to be implemented in Europe.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Military force reductions in Europe have resulted in diminished military medical services for many areas, particularly
those where the active duty end strength has fallen below levels which would support a military health clinic. Service
members and their families, particularly those in remote areas, have experienced significant access problems in
areas where military medical services have either been substantially reduced or eliminated. Although some military
families currently use civilian providers, differences in U.S. and local national billing practices have resulted
in payment delays which are unacceptable to host nation providers. Because local systems are not conducive to calculation
and collection of beneficiary deductibles and cost shares, these payments by beneficiaries are often overlooked
or substantially delayed and have become a source of major dissatisfaction among local providers. As a result, some
local providers have indicated they are no longer willing to accept CHAMPUS patients while others have begun to require
payment for services in advance. This demonstration is proposed for the purpose of testing whether special agreements
with host nation medical providers and elimination of CHAMPUS deductible and cost shares can enhance beneficiary
access to required care. Although earlier demonstration proposals for Europe limited participation to medically
remote or underserved areas, payment issues which have become barriers to access affect all active duty families
in Europe who must seek care in host nation hospitals and clinics. For this reason, the demonstration is proposed for
the entire region. Demonstration participants will include family members of all active duty personnel in the uniformed
services located in countries served by OCHAMPUS EUROPE. Under Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1092, the Department
is authorized to test different methods of financing delivery of health care services under CHAMPUS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under this CHAMPUS demonstration, active duty family members who are unable to access services in a military medical
treatment facility (MTF) may obtain both inpatient and outpatient services through local national medical facilities.
Where possible, written agreements will be executed between these local national medical facilities and elements
of the uniformed services in areas served by OCHAMPUS EUROPE. Care received under this demonstration project would
require neither the cost share nor the deductible normally collected for inpatient and outpatient services under
standard CHAMPUS.




While the primary demonstration component, elimination of CHAMPUS cost shares and deductibles, applies to all active
duty families, development of referral networks and agreements with host nation providers will be phased, with earliest
attention directed at remote or underserved areas which have experienced significant reduction or elimination
of military medical services. Initial development of referral networks and agreements will occur in Germany.

Demonstration participation will be restricted to active duty dependents. Active duty service members will be included
in provider agreements; separate procedures and funding will be used to account and process payment for care rendered
to active duty personnel as required by current regulation. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) will act as executive agent for purposes of this demonstration and will assume overall responsibility for
demonstration policy, implementation, and monitoring.




DURATION:

 This demonstration will operate for one year with two additional option years. Continuation of the program will depend
on a program evaluation conducted toward the end of the first year of operation.



It is our hypothesis that specific agreements with local national providers will clarify relationships and forge
stronger links between U.S. and host nation providers. These links will become more critical as troop withdrawals
continue to affect U.S. military medical presence and capabilities in Europe. Elimination of the beneficiary cost
share and deductible should ease a major source of conflict with respect to payment of host nation providers, thereby
improving access to care for our beneficiaries. A decreasing military presence in Europe can be likened to a shrinking
``market power'' and, hence, less capability for area commanders to negotiate favorable arrangements and/or access
to local civilian medical services. Formal agreements which clarify DoD's commitment to payment procedures and
deadlines and a streamlined administrative process without copayments and deductibles should provide positive
incentive for local facilities to accept CHAMPUS beneficiaries.




EXCLUSIONS TO THE EUROPE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT:

 Participation in this demonstration is limited to active duty dependents.



All current CHAMPUS rules, unless this notice specifically provides otherwise, will continue to apply. This notice
reflects the changes under this demonstration which is expected to start 1 October 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact and Environmental Assessment for Disposal and Reuse of Tacony Warehouse, Philadelphia,
PA</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DoD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Finding of no significant impact.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action analyzed by this document is the disposal and reuse of the Tacony Warehouse facility, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania as required by the Defense Authorization Amendments and the Base Closure and Realignment Act (Pub.
L. 100-526). The Army will dispose of an approximately 14 acre parcel of land with improvements. The Fort Dix
Directorate of Public Works has been maintaining the facility since closure in September 1992.


The alternatives are expressed in terms of Army imposed conditions for real estate disposal. An ``Unencumbered Alternative''
represents the ability to turn over the property with no Army imposed conditions. An ``Encumbered Alternative''
deals with property transferred with conditions imposed by the Army. This may be due to mitigation required by another
regulatory agency or may be required to protect Army interests. Council on Environmental Quality and Army regulations
implementing the National Environmental Protection Act require a no-action alternative as a benchmark against
which proposed actions are evaluated. For this document, this is the ``Caretaker'' alternative.
The ``Unencumbered Alternative'', the ``Encumbered Alternative'', and the ``No Action Alternative'' (Caretaker)
have been addressed in the Environmental Assessment (EA). In the ``Unencumbered Alternative'', the facility will
be available for reuse under a range of projected levels of reuse. Those projected levels of reuse are: High Intensity
Use, Medium Intensity Use, Low Intensity Use and Open Space.
High Intensity Use is defined when all of the property is offered for sale for a light industrial/commercial reuse.
There would be renovation of existing structures to house a light industrial/commercial enterprise. Some construction
activities, including building office and showroom space, will be performed within existing structures.
Medium Intensity Use is when all of the property is used as a regional distribution center. The facility's area of distribution
will be the Mid-Atlantic States region. There will be renovations of existing structures and renovation of the rail
lines entering the site.


Low Intensity use would occur if all of the property is sold or transferred for reuse as warehouse. An example of Open
Space is when the remainder of the parcel will be transferred to the city for use as an outdoor recreation area.
Land use in the ``Encumbered Alternative'' is similar to ``Low Intensity Use'' addressed in the ``Unencumbered Alternative.''
The identified encumbrance is associated with groundwater remediation activities and will restrict use of groundwater
for human ingestion or industrial purposes. Additionally, the 0.9 acre parcel adjacent to the state owned boat ramp
will be transferred to the Pennsylvania Fishing Commission as part of the boat ramp parking and picnic area. In the
no action alternative, also known as the ``Caretaker'' alternative, the Army will retain and close the facility.
The structures will be allowed to stand, with minimum maintenance activity conducted at the facility.
The disposal of Tacony Warehouse would not result in significant environmental or socioeconomic impacts. The transfer
of 0.9 acres to the Pennsylvania Fishing Commission will have no impact on the environment since the activities and
conditions at the 0.9 acre site will not change as a result of the transfer.
Army Environmental Center studies have identified the extent of contamination at the site. A remediation plan was
prepared and coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources. The following remediation has been planned: Removal of underground storage tanks and above ground storage
tanks; replacement of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated transformers; asbestos removal and management;
steam cleaning of contaminated building surfaces; contaminated soil and sediment removal; and groundwater collection
and monitoring. Since the structures on the property were constructed prior to 1978, the potential for lead based
paints exist. The Army does not plan to remove any lead based paint.
Reuse of the property will have potential impacts to air quality, water quality, soils, and hazardous and toxic materials.
The extent of these impacts will be dependent on: (1) The extent of renovation, demolition, and construction activities;
and (2) the products produced and stored at the facility. High intensity reuse and Open Space reuse, addressed in the
``Unencumbered Alternative'', will have the greatest impacts on these resources. Best management techniques will
lessen the impacts of construction and renovation. Prior to and during operations, consultation will occur with
environmental resource agencies, as required, to ensure compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations
and guidelines.
Increases to the facility's utility usage and the surrounding traffic patterns as a result of reuse will not pose a
significant impact to the surrounding community. No plant and animal ecologies exist on the property. No cultural
resources exist on the site to be affected by reuse. The State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the
Army's determination that no historic properties exist on the site. Since the disposal of Tacony Warehouse does not
constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the human environment, an Environmental Impact Statement
will not be prepared.

The purpose of this notice of extension of closing date is to allow the public_particularly school officials, teachers,
and college and university faculty_additional time to prepare and submit their comments. Many of these educators
only very recently became aware of the notice and will not be able to meet the September 6, 1994 deadline. Also, many
other potential commenters have been away from work during the comment period (summer months) and have neither received
nor been given information on the public notice. An extension of the comment period will permit many more educators
and other interested parties to submit comments and recommendations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On July 7, 1994, the Department of Education published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 34802) inviting the public to comment on the implementation by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement
(OERI) of its new authorizing legislation, the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement
Act of 1994.'' Comments will be used to help the Assistant Secretary plan for the reorganization of OERI and the activities
it will carry out, as well as establish, in collaboration with the National Educational Research Policy and Priorities
Board, priorities for OERI's future work. Detailed information on the statutory requirements of the ``Educational
Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994'' and on issues of special interest to the Assistant

Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of application closing date.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On February 17, 1994, the Department of Education published an application notice in the 

Federal Register

 inviting applications for schools to participate in the second year of the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan)
Program, which is the academic year beginning July 1, 1995. The notice pertained to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan
Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively
referred to as the Direct Loan Program.



The rolling application and selection process for this program was described in the February 17 notice, which specified
October 1, 1994 as the final deadline for application.

Many schools have indicated that they would like to apply for participation in the Direct Loan Program but are reluctant
to do so until they have had the opportunity to evaluate the program in progress. While the first year of the Direct Loan
Program began July 1, 1994, the academic year for many of the first-year schools does not begin until September. Therefore,
some procedures, such as funds disbursement and reconciliation, will occur at these schools for the first time in
September or October of 1994.

The Department wants to ensure that schools have adequate time to evaluate the day-to-day administration of the Direct
Loan Program and to observe the benefits of the program for students and schools prior to applying to participate.
Therefore, the deadline to submit applications for the second year of the program is extended to November 1, 1994.

By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $7,803,386.11 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund
(Superfund). The $7,803,386.11 represents approximately 11.2% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon
which this settlement was based.
In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).
The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste
the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified
by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response
costs for the Site ($69,594.403) by the total estimated volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons).
For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site
exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For
parties paying the 120% premium, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply.
For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, the public may submit comments to U.S. EPA relating
to the proposed 

de minimis

 Notice of intent to delete Allied Plating from the National Priorities List: request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10 announces its intent to delete the Allied Plating
Site (Site) from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this proposed action. The NPL constitutes
Appendix B to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated
pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
of 1980, as amended. EPA and the state of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have determined that all
appropriate actions under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup of the Site under CERCLA is necessary.
Moreover, EPA and DEQ have determined that remedial activities conducted at the Site to date have been protective
of public health, welfare and the environment.

I. Introduction 



EPA Region 10 announces its intent to delete the Allied Plating site from the National Priorities List (NPL), Appendix
B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, and requests comments on this
deletion. EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to human health or the environment, and places
these sites on the NPL. EPA has the discretion to use its authorities under CERCLA or RCRA, or to designate a state with
remedial authorities to accomplish appropriate cleanup at sites listed on the NPL. As described in  300.425(e)(3)
of the NCP, sites deleted from the NPL remain eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that
conditions at the site warrant such actions. 

EPA plans to delete the site, located at 8135 Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, Portland, Oregon, from the NPL. 

EPA will accept comments on this proposal to delete this Site for thirty days after publication of this notice in the


Federal Register

. 

Section II of this Notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the Allied Plating Site and explains how the Site meets the deletion
criteria. 



II. NPL Deletion Criteria 



Section 300.425(e) of the NCP, 40 CFR 300.425(e), provides that sites may be deleted from, or recategorized on, the
NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making a determination to delete a site from the NPL, EPA shall consider,
in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met: 




(1) EPA has determined that responsible or other parties have implemented all appropriate response actions required;
or 

(2) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented, no further cleanup by responsible
parties is appropriate; or 

(3) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and therefore, taking remedial measures is not appropriate. 



III. Deletion Procedures Followed for the Allied Plating Site

The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of this Site: 




(1) EPA Region 10 has determined that the Site was successfully remediated through a Removal Action which took place
in the fall of 1992. On June 29, 1993, EPA issued a No Further Action Record of Decision (ROD) after the public comment
period ended. No comments were received. 

(2) EPA Region 10 has recommended deletion of the Site and has made the relevant documents available to the public for
review in the information repositories. 

(3) The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has concurred with the deletion decision. 




Deletion of the Allied Plating Site from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual rights or obligations.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes to assist EPA management. As mentioned in Section II of this
Notice, 40 CFR 300.425(e)(3) states that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for future Fund-financed
response actions. 

For deletion of this Site, EPA's Regional Office will accept and evaluate public comments on EPA's Notice of Intent
to Delete before making a final decision to delete. The EPA will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, addressing
significant public comments. 

A deletion occurs when the Regional Administrator places a final notice in the 

Federal Register

. Generally, the NPL will reflect deletions in the final update following the notice. Public notices and copies of
the Responsiveness Summary will be made available to local residents by the Regional EPA office. 



IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 



The following site summary provides EPA Region 10's rationale for the intention to delete the Allied Plating Site
from the NPL. 

The Allied Plating Site is located at 8135 Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Boulevard, in an industrial and commercial
district of northeastern Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon. 

The Site covers approximately 12 acres, and contained the buildings which formerly housed a plating operation and
a waste disposal area approximately 3 acres in size. 

In 1957, the buildings were leased for the operation of Allied Plating, Inc., a chrome plating facility which operated
from that year until 1984, when the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. 

Prior to 1969, wastewater from the facility was discharged to a swale leading to the Columbia Slough (an off-site water
body). After 1969, landfilling north of the property cut off natural drainage, and as a result the discharge of liquid
wastes from the plating facility created a lagoon on-site. The metals in the plating wastewater precipitated out,
forming a layer of plating waste at the bottom of the lagoon. Aerial photographs indicate that the lagoon covered approximately
3 acres during the time when the company was discharging plating wastes into the lagoon. After the company ceased its
discharges, the lagoon receded, leaving a small pond with the surrounding area covered with plating waste. 

EPA conducted a Remedial Investigation (RI) at the Site between January 1990 and April 1992. The RI determined that
the Site contamination was mainly limited to the area formerly covered by the lagoon. 

Following the RI, the Site was evaluated for a potential Removal Action as part of the Superfund Accelerated Cleanup
Model (SACM) Program. The Site met the criteria for remediation under a Removal Action. This Removal Action took place
between October 20 and November 10, 1992. During the Removal Action, the pond was drained, and the pond sludges and
the plating waste in the surrounding areas were excavated and shipped off-site for disposal at Envirosafe Services,
Inc., in Grandview, Idaho (a facility identified by EPA as being eligible to receive CERCLA wastes). Approximately
1100 cubic yards of sludge and waste were excavated and disposed of in this manner. The Site owner also placed a deed
restriction on the Site property, preventing the use of the shallow groundwater beneath the Site. The RI had determined
that one well in this aquifer had nickel concentrations above drinking water standards. 

Following the Removal Action, EPA conducted a risk assessment on the contaminant concentrations remaining in the
surface soils of the Site. Although the remediated area had been backfilled during the Removal Action by at least one
foot of rock, to be conservative in the analysis, it was assumed that there would be direct human exposure to the remaining
residual contaminant concentrations. The results indicated that the Removal Action achieved a site cleanup level
which left the health threat associated with site-related contaminants well below a 1 x 10

^4

 excess cancer risk. The remaining hazard index was 2 for a residential scenario and 0.2 for an industrial scenario.
A hazard index of 1 is the level where no toxic effects are expected to occur.

<DOCNO> FR940902-2-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940902-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This residual contamination level is negligibly above levels that would allow for unlimited use and unrestricted
exposure. The Site was remediated to industrial standards. The Site is currently used for light industry and is expected
to remain so, given the historical land use in this area. In addition, although the remaining surface contamination
level had a residential hazard index of 2, the residual contamination is buried under one or more feet of crushed rock
used as backfill; therefore, no contact route exists. 

EPA signed a Record of Decision for no further action at the Allied Plating Site on June 29, 1993. The Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality concurred with the no further action remedy selection. 

EPA believes that the implemented remedy at the Allied Plating Site is protective of the public health and the environment.
All possible exposure pathways from contamination on-site have been addressed, including groundwater and near-surface
soils. 

A five year review is scheduled to be conducted at the Allied Plating Site by June 1998. If EPA determines that the remedy
is still protective of public health and the environment, no further five year reviews will be conducted. 

EPA has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the Allied Plating Site have been
completed, and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. The Oregon State Department of Environmental
Quality has concurred with this decision.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-16.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME-94-16. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met.
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA nonconfidential information
center (NCIC), Rm. ETG-102 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding

<DOCTITLE>Massachusetts Marine Sanitation Device Standard for Coastal Waters of Westport; Notice of Determination</DOCTITLE>


On July 19, 1994, notice was published that the State of Massachusetts had petitioned the Regional Administrator,
Environmental Protection Agency, to determine that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment
of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the coastal waters of Westport Harbor and the East and West
Branches of the Westport River that border the Town of Westport, within the State of Massachusetts (56 FR 36758). The
petition was filed pursuant to Section 312(f)(3) of Pub. L. 92-500 as amended by Pub. L. 95-217 and Pub.
L. 100-4. 
Section 312(f)(3) states: 
After the effective date of the initial standards and regulations promulgated under this section, if any State determines
that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters within such States require greater environmental
protection, such State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not,
into such waters, except that no such prohibition shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities
for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for such water
to which such prohibition would apply. 
The State of Massachusetts has certified that there are two pump-out facilities available to service vessels in the
Westport Harbor and the Westport River. 
Pump-out facility No. 1, which is mobile, is located at the Town Pier on the north side of the Westport Harbor. This facility
has a holding capacity of 650 gallons and it is marked with a yellow and maroon U.S.EPA issued boat pump-out sign. The
hours of operation will be upon request during the summer season from Memorial Day through Columbus Day seven days
a week from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. by calling the Harbormaster's office at (508) 636-1105 or by radio on Channel 9 VHF.
The mobile boat pump-out has a draft requirement of 2 feet. Vessels located in waters with depths of less than 2 feet
may need to move to deeper water to be pumped out. The cost is free and will be absorbed through boating licenses for the
season. 
Pump-out facility No. 2 will be established at Tripps Marina. The hours of operation during the summer season from
Memorial Day through Columbus Day are seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. There is no fee to use the pump-out facility. Tripps is the largest marina in Westport with
250 slips and 150 moorings. There are fuel facilities, on-shore toilet and shower facilities, and a waste oil receptacle
available to boaters. 
The Town operates and maintains a 1000 gallon above ground holding tank for septage with secondary containment on
the south side of Westport Harbor. The tank is located adjacent to the State Boat Ramp and may be accessed from the water.

Septage is collected by Ocean Arks, Inc., a research facility located in Marion, MA. In the event that Ocean Arks, Inc.
ceases to accept the boat septage, the Town of Westport has a renewable contract with New England Sanitation, a licensed
septic hauler, located in Westport, MA. Septage that is removed by New England Sanitation will be treated at the Fall
River Wastewater Treatment Facility in Fall River, MA. 
There are an estimated 350 moored boats in the East Branch of the Westport River, 100 moored boats in the West Branch,
770 moored boats in the Westport Harbor, and approximately 20 transient vessels which enter the harbor each day through
the mouth of the harbor during the boating season. Westport is approximately 14 miles long, 5.2 miles wide, with a total
area of 57 square miles.
There were no comments received by the Agency on the merits of the petition prior to the deadline for receipt of comments
as stated in the July 19, 1994 

Federal Register

 ``Receipt of Petition'' notice. 
Based on an examination of the petition, and its supporting information which included a site visit by EPA Region I
staff, and the fact that the Agency received no comments concerning the petition, I have determined that adequate
facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for
the Westport Harbor and the East and West Branches of the Westport River that border the Town of Westport, within the
State of Massachusetts, to qualify as a ``No Discharge Area''. 
This determination is made pursuant to Section 312(f)(3) of Pub. L. 92-500, as amended by Pub. L. 95-217
and Pub. L. 100-4.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case:






Pantelis Constantoulakis, Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc.: 

The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) reviewed an investigation
conducted by Advanced BioScience Laboratories (ABL) into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Mr. Constantoulakis
while an employee of ABL at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. ORI concurred with the factual findings
as set forth in the ABL report, and finds that Mr. Constantoulakis committed scientific misconduct by falsifying
and fabricating data in biomedical research supported by a contract with the National Cancer Institute and by misrepresenting
his academic credentials for purposes of his employment under the contract. Mr. Constantoulakis accepted the misconduct
finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which Mr. Constantoulakis will not apply
for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for
a five-year period beginning August 2, 1994.

One published paper (

<DOCTITLE>Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Sanford Cohen and Associates'
Technical Working Group; Public Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces
the following meeting:





Name: 

Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Sanford Cohen and Associates'
Technical Working Group_Public Meeting.


Time and date:

 8:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m., September 14, 1994.


Place: 

Best Western-Cottontree Inn, 1415 Bench Road, Pocatello, Idaho 83201.


Status:

 Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available.


Purpose:

 Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of
residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or
to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.
An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living offsite of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction
of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for
DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associates
(SC&A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public
involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&A will discuss project progress and responses
to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions
faced by SC&A's project team.
Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.

<DOCTITLE>Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies and
Laboratories that Have Withdrawn From the Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS (Formerly: National Institute on Drug Abuse, ADAMHA,
HHS).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 



If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified, an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds
of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate
in a quarterly performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 

not 

to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless 

v. 

Veterans Administration, 

No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).


Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to David
Pollack at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

i.e.,

Notice of Proposed Interdepartmental Agreement on Indian Housing Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and 
Indian Housing, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed interdepartmental agreement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With this Notice, HUD's Office of Native American Programs is soliciting comments from Tribal Councils, Indian Housing
Authorities, and other interested parties on a proposed Interdepartmental Agreement on HUD's Indian Housing Program
before this proposed agreement is adopted as final.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed Interdepartmental Agreement on HUD's Indian Housing Program sets forth the working relationship
among the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health
Service (IHS) in the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHA) in conjunction with the planning
and construction of new housing developed with financial assistance of HUD's Indian Housing Program. 


The Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and guidelines
by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as
necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision makers and the specific
federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing. 
The Department has been working with the BIA and IHS to revise the existing Interdepartmental Agreement which was
published in 1976 and has not been updated to meet the regulatory requirement revisions that affect federal tribal
interaction in the Indian Housing Program. The BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) was eliminated from this IA
to streamline the agreement among all signatory agencies in the development of HUD Indian housing programs. It is
anticipated that the IHS and the BIA will be addressing the BIA-HIP separately. Other sections pertaining to program
procedures are more appropriately covered in the program handbook or program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)
and have been deleted from the IA. 
The text of the proposed Interdepartmental Agreement follows: 




PROPOSED INTERDEPARTMENTAL AGREEMENT ON THE INDIAN HOUSING PROGRAM 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT_OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS 
THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR_BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES_INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE 
1.0 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 


The purpose of the Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) is to set forth the working relationship among the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in
the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) in conjunction with the planning and construction
of new Indian housing developments. The above agencies share a common goal to assist Tribes in improving their living
environment through the delivery of quality housing and infrastructure. This goal can be more readily achieved with
an efficient and integrated utilization of available resources. 
The Interdepartmental Agreement establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and the guidelines
by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as
necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision-makers and the specific
federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing. 


2.0 GENERAL AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES. 


2.1 

HUD RESPONSIBILITIES. 

HUD will provide financial assistance for the development and management of low income housing and community developments
in Indian and Alaska Native areas through the Traditional Indian Housing Development Program. 
2.2 

BIA RESPONSIBILITIES. 

BIA will review and approve all required trust land lease issues, easements and real estate appraisals; provide maintenance
services to those IHA constructed roads and streets accepted into the BIA road systems in accordance with 25 CFR Part
170; and provide other support, when available, necessary for the timely development of housing. 
2.3 

IHS RESPONSIBILITIES. 

The IHS provides a comprehensive primary and preventive health services delivery system for American Indians and
Alaska Natives. The environmental health component of IHS assists Tribes by providing technical and financial assistance
in the development of tribal sanitation facilities [water, waste water, and solid waste facilities and operation
& maintenance (O&M) infrastructure]. As originally authorized under the Indian Sanitation Facilities
Act of 1959 (Public Law 86-121), and as amended by the Health Care Improvement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-713),
IHS has the primary responsibility and authority to provide Native American homes and communities with the necessary
sanitation facilities and related services. 


3.0 AGENCY COORDINATION. 


3.1 

PROCESSING PROCEDURES. 

The signatories of the IA agree to maintain timely and relevant processing of regulations, handbooks, notices and
other administrative guidance for use by Tribes and IHAs. All signatory agencies will be given an opportunity to comment
on such documents before they are made effective.

<TEXT>
 

3.2 

PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION

. The signatories of the IA agree to enforce the provisions of current program guidance with their respective area/regional
offices. Disputes between or among the signatory agencies may be made in writing to the head of the appropriate area
or field office involved, with a copy to the other agencies. Unresolved disputes extending more than 90 days beyond
the date of submission shall be referred, in writing, to the Headquarters Working Group for resolution. This group
is composed of the Director, Office of Native American Programs in HUD; Director, Office of Trust Responsibilities
in BIA; and the Director, Division of Environmental Health in IHS. 

3.3 

INFORMATION SHARING

. Whenever possible, the signatory agencies will provide, or cause to be provided, copies of housing and supporting
infrastructure planning documents, to include utility master plans, transportation plans, and IHA comprehensive
housing plans, to the appropriate area/regional offices of other signatory agencies. 

HUD Field Offices of Native American Programs will provide quarterly reports on the progress of HUD's assisted housing
projects to BIA and IHS. These reports will indicate the method of construction, project number, and number of units.
Scheduled and actual completion dates for applicable project review points will be provided, where available. 

3.4 

GRANT AWARD

. Signatory agencies will provide copies of applicable housing and supporting infrastructure grant/project award
notices to the other signatory agencies as soon as practicable after notification to Tribes. 



4.0 DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING UNITS. 



4.1 

HUD RESPONSIBILITIES

. 

4.1.1 Applications. HUD will advise IHAs to use BIA and IHS summaries of existing infrastructure and recommendations
to support proposed housing project applications for funding. 

4.1.2 Project Coordination. HUD will advise IHAs to use handbooks concerning procedures the IHA may use to
determine what assistance they need from the BIA and IHS. At the request of a Tribe through the IHA, the BIA (including
Area Road Engineers and Realty Officers) and IHS will provide, to the extent feasible, technical reviews and recommendations
on project planning, design and construction documents involving supporting infrastructure, and related requirements
at appropriate project review points. Appropriate project review points will be determined on a project by project
basis and may include: project coordination schedule review, housing site feasibility review, project plan review,
project final inspection, and record drawings review. Schedules or commitments made as a result of project coordination
require the approval of the appropriate IHS and/or BIA official. 

4.1.3 Standard vs Assisted Housing Development Method. The Standard Method of development refers to all
procedures, guidelines and requirements associated with the normal development of an Indian housing project by
an administratively capable IHA. The Assisted Method contains all of the procedures, guidelines and requirements
associated with the development of an Indian housing development by an IHA which has requested additional HUD assistance
due to its inexperience or lack of staff resources, or by an IHA which has been deemed by HUD to need additional assistance,
monitoring and supervision during the development process. The Standard Method will require less oversight by the
signatory agencies as compared to the Assisted Method. 

4.2 

BIA RESPONSIBILITIES.

 

Leases, Easements and Real Estate Appraisals on Trust Property. Where resources are available, the BIA will provide
real estate appraisals at the request of the IHA. All leases and easements shall be approved by the BIA.

5.0 DEVELOPMENT OF ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE ROADS. 



5.1 

HUD RESPONSIBILITIES. 

On-Site Street Construction. HUD will provide sufficient funds for the construction of on-site streets, in accordance
with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. The IHA will have
the overall responsibility for construction of on-site streets. The Tribal government must determine the type of
streets to be constructed in conjunction with housing projects, and whether the streets will be included in the BIA
Roads System for maintenance by the BIA. HUD will advise each IHA and Tribe which receives a HUD Housing Grant that the
on-site streets must be designed and constructed to AASHTO standards to be eligible for inclusion on the BIA roads
system. 
5.2 BIA RESPONSIBILITIES. 
5.2.1 Access Road Construction. When requested by the Tribal government, the BIA will plan and construct
access roads to housing developments. Sufficient lead time is required to develop access roads. This lead time may
be as much as 21/2 years. The BIA will coordinate access road construction with the IHA and make every effort to complete
such roads prior to the completion of the housing project. 

5.2.2 Road/Street Maintenance. IHA-developed streets may be added to the BIA Roads System only when the street(s)
and related curb, gutters and drainage features have been built to acceptable AASHTO specifications and standards,
and the right-of-way is transferred to the BIA. When requested by the Tribal government, the BIA Area Office will accept
IHA developed streets on the BIA Roads System and will provide ongoing maintenance for those streets that meet the
above specifications and standards. 



6.0 DEVELOPMENT OF SANITATION FACILITIES. 



6.1 HUD RESPONSIBILITY

. To the extent that funds are appropriated by Congress, HUD will fund the water, waste water, solid waste facilities,
and O&M infrastructure necessary for the traditional HUD financed housing projects. O&M infrastructure
includes the plant, equipment, tools and training needed by utility authorities to provide continuing sanitation
service to the residents of HUD-financed homes, as well as the long range planning necessary to identify and implement
those requirements. 

6.2 

IHS RESPONSIBILITY.

 IHS provides water, waste water, solid waste facilities, and O&M infrastructure based on Congressional directives
and to the extent that funds are appropriated. IHS also receives funds from Tribes or other agencies to provide sanitation
facilities under its authorities. Eligibility for IHS financial assistance is determined by IHS on a project by project
basis, and funding is based on a duly executed MOA. 

6.3 

IHS PARTICIPATION IN HUD FUNDED SANITATION FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION. 

When requested by the Tribe and the IHA, IHS may participate in the construction of sanitation facilities funded under
the traditional HUD-assisted housing development program. IHS participation will be on a project by project basis,
pursuant to an approved MOA duly executed by the IHA, Tribe, IHS, and if necessary, HUD. 

6.4 

INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY SANITATION SYSTEMS

. Where it is determined that sanitation facilities are feasible and necessary, the following conditions will apply:


6.4.1 The agency financing the house construction or improvement is responsible for the installation of
all dwelling plumbing facilities. 

6.4.2 Where facilities serve only HUD-assisted housing project homes, HUD will fund the total cost of the
sanitation facilities necessary to serve the project. Where HUD-assisted housing project homes are interspersed
with existing homes also served by a sanitation facility, HUD shall fund a prorated share of sanitation facilities
costs. All community sanitation system construction, improvement, or expansion will be designed on the basis of
a total community concept, such that the proposed sanitation facilities are (a) safe and adequate to meet the environmental
health needs of residents, (b) compatible with tribal infrastructure development, and (c) economically feasible
to construct and operate. 



7.0 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. 



Each signatory agency (HUD, BIA, and IHS) shall be responsible for following its own applicable procedures addressing
the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and related and/or similar environmental legislation
and/or Executive Orders. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), dated June 21, 1991, signed by BIA, HUD, IHS, and
the Environmental Protection Agency clarifies each agencies' role in environmental protection. 

In the implementation of the roles identified in the MOU and the responsibilities assigned in the IA, to the extent
feasible, all signatory agencies will adopt and/or combine environmental documents that comply with NEPA and related
regulations, which are provided by the other signatory agencies, in order to reduce duplication and paperwork. Copies
of one signatory agency's environmental determination documentation (e.g., archeological review) may be required
by another signatory agency prior to granting approvals; however, the approving agency shall not require the applying
agency to change procedures, format, etc., during the review process and prior to granting its approval.

Notice of Availability of a Technical/Agency Draft Recovery Plan for Leptocereus Grantianus for Review and Comment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery
plan for 

Leptocereus grantianus. 

This cactus occurs only on Culebra, an island located to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The species is threatened by
agricultural, residential and tourist development on adjacent uplands as well as damage from storms. The Service
solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened species or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish them,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

This Technical/Agency Draft is for 

Leptocereus grantianus, 

a cactus endemic to the Culebra, a small island off northeastern Puerto Rico. Only one population is currently known
and consists of approximately 50 individuals. This spineless cactus, reaching up to 2 meters in height and 3 to 5 centimeters
in diameter, occurs in dry thickets along a rocky shoreline in southwestern Culebra. The populations is threatened
by agricultural, residential, and tourist development on the adjacent uplands, cutting for use as livestock feed,
damage from heavy storm surge, and possible collection.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the sensitive
joint-vetch (

Aeschynomene virginica

). The sensitive joint-vetch is an annual legume that occurs in intertidal areas along river systems in North Carolina,
Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. The species was listed as a threatened species in 1992 due to destruction and degradation
of its habitat. The primary recovery strategy for this species is to protect extant sensitive joint-vetch sites within
six watersheds in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this
draft Plan.

) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.
The document submitted for review is the draft Sensitive Joint-Vetch (

Aeschynomene virginica

) Recovery Plan. The Sensitive joint-vetch is an annual legume of the bean family native to the eastern United States.
This species occurs in freshwater tidal river systems; currently, it is known from a total of 24 extant sites, including
one in New Jersey, one in Maryland, two in North Carolina and 20 in Virginia. Almost every population of this species
is subject to water withdrawal projects or habitat loss, modification, or degradation from development.
The goal of the sensitive joint-vetch recovery program is to protect, maintain, and increase the species and its habitat,
enabling eventual removal of this plant from the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. This
will be accomplished through habitat protection (preventing habitat destruction and deterioration) at the landscape
level and possibly by finding additional populations.
The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the Plan.


Authority


The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Tariffs of Carriers Whose Operating Authorities Have Been Revoked 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of the Commission's intention to treat as cancelled the tariffs of carriers whose operating authorities have
been revoked and remain inactive for one year. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ICC announces that, effective immediately, it will treat as cancelled the tariffs of any carrier whose operating
authority is revoked and remains inactive for a one-year period. This will permit the Commission to reduce its storage
costs for tariffs, and will avoid misleading the public by having meaningless tariffs included in the active tariff
library. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In recent years, a significant number of carriers have had their operating authorities revoked and gone out of business
without canceling their tariffs. In the absence of formal cancellation action by the carriers, we have retained these
tariffs in the active tariff library. In our view, the retention of such tariffs in the active tariff library should
be discontinued since it imposes unnecessary storage costs and can mislead the public by indicating the availability
of service and pricing that no longer exist.


The Interstate Commerce Act does not permit a carrier to file tariffs covering service which it is not authorized to
provide. Thus, once a carrier's operating authority is revoked, there is no lawful basis for the continued existence
of any effective tariffs covering service formerly authorized by the revoked authority. We believe we can treat such
tariffs as cancelled whether or not the carrier whose operating authority is revoked takes formal action to cancel
them.

1 






There are numerous instances each year in which the Commission revokes carriers' operating authorities because
they fail to maintain insurance coverage as required by the Commission's regulations. In many instances, once the
carriers realize that their operating authorities have been revoked, they reinstate the required coverage and request
that their authorities be reinstated. As a matter of practice, the carriers have been allowed to reinstate operations
without being required to file new tariffs. In these revocations and reinstatements, however, the entire process
is typically completed within a few months, so the procedures announced in this notice, which provide that tariffs
will be deemed cancelled after 1 year of inactivity, will not affect current tariff reinstatement practices.

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources.

Delaware Valley Railway Co., Inc., Modified Rail Certificate 


On June 17, 1994, as amended or supplemented July 5, July 22, and August 18, 1994, Delaware Valley Railway Company,
Inc. (Delaware), filed a notice for a modified certificate of public convenience and necessity under 49 CFR Part 1150,
Subpart C, to operate approximately 53.82 miles of rail line as follows: (1) 17.32 miles of rail extending between
milepost 12.7 at the Delaware/Pennsylvania line and milepost 30.02 at Modena, PA, owned by the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (PennDOT); and (2) 36.50 miles of rail extending between milepost 18.0 at Wawa, PA, and milepost
54.50 at Sylmar, MD, owned by the South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). 




Delaware states that it planned to commence operations on July 1, 1994, the day after Octoraro Railway, Inc. (Octoraro),
the current operator, was to terminate service.

2 






The lines were not included in the final system plan at the time the Consolidated Rail Corporation was formed, and,
as such, were authorized to be abandoned without further Commission approval pursuant to the Railroad Revitalization
and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-210. PennDOT acquired its line segment (a portion of USRA line 907/939)
from the Trustees of the Reading Railroad, and SEPTA acquired its line segment (a portion of USRA line 142) from the
Trustees of the Penn Central Transportation Company, after the respective lines were abandoned in 1976.

3 






The Commission will serve a copy of this notice on the Association of American Railroads (Car Service Division), as
agent of all railroads subscribing to the car-service and car-hire agreement, and on the American Short Line Railroad
Association. 



Decided: August 26, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>RailAmerica, Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_Delaware Valley Railway Company, Inc. </DOCTITLE>


RailAmerica, Inc. (RAI), a noncarrier holding company, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Delaware
Valley Railway Company, Inc. (Delaware), a noncarrier, upon the latter becoming a class III rail carrier. 
In related proceedings, Delaware has concurrently filed: (1) A modified rail certificate to operate two rail lines

1 

totalling approximately 53.82 miles, 

see Delaware Valley Railway Company, Inc._Modified Rail Certificate, 

Finance Docket No. 32535; and (2) a designated operator certificate to operate a 9.8-mile rail line extending between
milepost 2.9 at Elsmere Jct., DE, and milepost 12.7 at the Delaware/Pennsylvania line,

2 



see Certificate of Designated Operator, Delaware Valley Railway Company, 

D-OP 59 (USRA Line No. 907/939). The notice became effective on June 24, 1994.

3 








RAI owns and controls the following class III rail carriers: Huron and Eastern Railway Company, Inc. (operating in
Michigan); Saginaw Valley Railway Company (operating in Michigan); and South Central Tennessee Railroad Corporation
(operating in Tennessee).
RAI states that: (1) The lines to be operated by Delaware do not connect with any of the other lines controlled by it;
(2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect Delaware with
any railroad in the corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the transaction
is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. 

See 

49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist.

, 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Robert A.
Wimbish, Rea, Cross & Auchincloss, Suite 420, 1920 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20036.

The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address show below, not later than September 12, 1994.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than September 12, 1994.

The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Nike, Inc., Beaverton, OR; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated August 5, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on July 15, 1994 and published in the Federal
Register

 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38494).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
The findings show that the headquarters for Nike, Inc., is in Beaverton, Oregon. The Beaverton workers are engaged
in marketing services, administrative functions, retail servicing and research and development.
The investigation findings show that Nike does not produce products directly but contracts with non-affiliated
firms for the production of athletic and casual footwear, apparel and sports accessories.
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the Beaverton workers do not produce an article within the meaning
of Section 223 of the Trade Act. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does
not constitute the production of an article as required by Section 222 of the Trade Act, and this determination has
been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Only in very limited instances are marketing and other support workers certified for trade adjustment assistance
(TAA), namely the worker separations must be caused by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling
firm or subdivision whose workers produce an article and who are currently under a certification for TAA. These conditions
were not met for the workers at Nike, Inc., in Beaverton, Oregon.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Sola Optical, USA, Inc., Muskogee, OK; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On July 19, 1994, the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice
of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on June 27, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36792).

The petitioners claim that they were affected by a shift in production to Mexico and consequently, increased imports.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of August, 1994.
In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.
(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,
(2) that sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and
(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.


Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance

regarding eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA issued during the month of August 1994.
In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA
the following group eligibility requirements of Section 250 of the Trade Act must be met:
(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
(including workers in any agricultural firm or appropriate subdivision thereof) have become totally or partially
separated from employment and either_
(A) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,
(B) that imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm
or subdivison have increased.
(C) that the increase in imports contributed importantly to such workers' separations or threat of separation and
to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivison; or
(2) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.


Negative Determinations NAFTA-TAA


NAFTA-TAA-000178; Leggett & Platt, Inc., Fashion Bed Group, Chicago, IL



The investigation revealed that criteria (3) & criteria (4) were not met. There was no shift in production from
the workers' firm to Mexico or Canada during the relevant period. The investigation revealed that production declined
at the subject firm in 1993 & during the first six months of 1994 & that company imports & beds & accessories
increased during these time periods. However, the company imports were not from Mexico or Canada.



NAFTA-TAA-00180; Occidental Chemical Corp., Agricultural Products Group, White Springs, FL



The investigation revealed that criteria (1) was not met in conjunction with the requirements of Section 506(b)(2)
of the Act. No worker separations occurred at the subject firm on or after December 8, 1993, the earliest reachback
date for coverage under the NAFTA-TAA program.

NAFTA-TAA-00174; 

Keyes Fibre Co., Van Leer Corp., Sacramento, CA




The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. Worker separations at the Sacramento,
CA plant of Keyes Fibre Co were a result of a corporate restructuring effort to utilize more efficiently the capacity
of all company plants. The production of rough-molded products & smooth-molded FoodService products was transferred
from the subject plant to other domestic plants of Keyes Fibre Co.






NAFTA-TAA-00179; 

Pet Connection, Gun Barrel City, TX




The investigation revealed that the workers of the subject firm did not produce an article within the meaning of the
Act. The Department of Labor has consistently determined that the performance of services did not constitute production
of an article as required by the Trade Act of 1974.



Affirmative Determinations NAFTA-TAA





NAFTA-TAA-00177; 

Bell Sports, Inc., Vistalite Div., Lancaster, PA




A certification was issued covering all workers of VistaLite Division of Bell Sports, Inc., Lancaster, PA, separated
on or after December 8, 1993.






NAFTA-TAA-00176; 

A.O. Smith Electrical Products Co., Mebane, NC




A certification was issued covering all workers engaged in employment related to the production of fractional horsepower
motors on Lones 720 and 722 at the Mebane NC plant of A.O. Smith Electrical Products Co separated on or after December
8, 1993.

I hereby certify that the aforementioned determinations were issued during the month of August, 1994. Copies of these
determinations are available for inspection in Room C-4318, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue,

<DOCTITLE>Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program: Unemployment Insurance Program Letters Interpreting Federal
Unemployment Insurance Law</DOCTITLE>


The Employment and Training Administration interprets Federal law requirements pertaining to unemployment compensation
as part of its role in the administration of the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. These interpretations
are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs).
The UIPL described below is published in the 

Federal Register

 in order to inform the public.


Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 41-94


This UIPL advises SESAs of the actions which must be undertaken by States in order to meet the requirements of Sections
303(a)(10) and 303(j) of the Social Security Act (SSA). Compliance with the provisions of the SSA is a condition for
the receipt of administration grants for the operation of the Unemployment Insurance program.
Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) were added to the SSA by Public Law 103-152. Under Section 303(j), SSA, States
are required to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC in order to identify those
claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services in order to obtain new work. Section
303(a)(10), SSA, also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate
in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility.

To provide guidance on Unemployment Insurance (UI) program requirements for the Worker Profiling and Reemployment
Services system. 
2.

Issuances. 

Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 13-94, dated January 28, 1994; UIPL 13-94, Change 1,
dated April 15, 1994; and the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, Part V, Employment Security Manual,
Section 6010 

et seq. 
3. Background. 

On November 24, 1993, the President signed into law the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 (P.L. 103-152)
which added Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) to the SSA. Both of these new sections contain requirements States must
meet as a condition of States receiving UI grants. (The text of both sections is contained in the Attachment.) Under
Section 303(j)(1), SSA, the State must: 



 Identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UI 

and 

will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment. (Subparagraph (A) of
section 303(j)(1), SSA.)
 Refer the claimants so identified to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, available
under any State or Federal law. (Subparagraph (B) of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 
 Collect follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and their employment outcomes
and use the information for future profiling. (Subparagraph (C) of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 
 Meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.'' (Subparagraph (D)
of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 



In addition, Section 303(a)(10), SSA, requires claimants to participate in reemployment services to which they
have been referred as a condition of UI eligibility. P.L. 103-152 requires the Secretary of Labor to provide
technical assistance and advice to the States in implementing the worker profiling systems. 
One of the principal aims of the profiling system is to provide reemployment services to certain claimants through
an ``early intervention'' processes. That is, claimants who are unlikely to return to their previous jobs or occupations
will be identified and given assistance early in their claims series. This approach is expected to facilitate an early
return to employment and savings to each state's unemployment fund.
In response to this legislation, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) has launched a major initiative to establish
an integrated, comprehensive worker profiling and reemployment services system involving various programs, including
the UI, Employment Service, and Title III, JTPA programs. To this end, information describing how a recommended integrated
system might operate was issued to the States through the Department's Regional Offices. (This recommended system
followed the overall approach embodied in the proposed Reemployment Act of 1994.) However, since the SSA amendments
create specific requirements as a condition of receiving UI administrative grants, it is necessary to provide guidance
to States concerning what actions 

must 

be taken concerning the UI program. This issuance provides definitive guidance concerning these actions. 
Among other things, this UIPL describes the minimum required profiling system for identifying and referring claimants.
That the States must use this required profiling system does not, however, abridge the States' authority to use other
methods, not related to the minimum system, for identifying claimants for referral. For example, assuming a service
provider has twenty-five slots, a State may refer only fifteen claimants identified under the minimum required profiling
system to the provider if the State also refers ten claimants using whatever methods it deems appropriate.
4. 

Overview of Profiling and Reemployment Services System. 

Federal law does not specify a detailed structure for the profiling and reemployment services system. That is left
to the States. However, in order to meet the statutory requirements and coordinate between the various employment
and training programs, the Department anticipates that the following general structure will be used by all States:



 The UI agency will profile all claimants to identify those likely to exhaust regular UI and in need of reemployment
services. 
 To the extent that reemployment services are available, the ``identified'' claimants will either be immediately
referred to these services or placed in a selection pool from which a referral may later be made.
 Services will begin with an orientation session advising claimants of the availablility and benefit of reemployment
services, and, if appropriate, an individual assessment of each claimant's needs. Based on an individual service
plan, the claimant may be referred to reemployment services tailored to the individual's needs.
 The entity providing the reemployment services will promptly provide the UI agency with any necessary information
relating to the claimants' continuing eligibility for UI.



5. 

Arrangements with Service Provider(s). 

Under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D), SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish other requirements
as are determined appropriate, the Department has determined that State UI agencies are to establish certain arrangements
with the entities providing reemployment services. When the UI agency is not part of the same overall State agency
as the service provider (for example, an employment security agency or executive department), the Department recommends
that these arrangements be in a written agreement. Arrangements must be made in two areas: The number of claimants
to be referred to the provider and the information the provider must forward to the UI agency.

a. 

Number of Claimants Referred.

 The burden of reporting to service providers should not be placed upon claimants when services are not available.
Similarly, service providers should not be required to expend time and resources working with referred claimants
when services are not available for them. Therefore, there must be a balance between the available supply of services
and referrals to these services. To avoid excessive referrals, the agreement must provide a method for assuring that
the number of claimants referred to the provider is based on the number the provider is able to serve.



Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, only requires the referral to ``available'' reemployment services of claimants identified
as likely to exhaust regular UI and who need job search assistance. Therefore, the State will meet the requirements
of Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, when the supply of services and referrals to these services is balanced.



b. 

Receipt of Information.

 New Section 303(a)(10), SSA, requires that claimants, identified and referred to reemployment services through
profiling, participate in such services, or in similar services, as a condition of UI eligibility. Also, Section
303(a)(1), SSA, requires ``methods of administration * * * as are found by the Secretary to be reasonably
calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.'' This means the UI agency must have methods
of administration for obtaining eligibility information from service providers and for promptly determining eligibility
based on this information. To ensure service providers meet the UI agency's needs, arrangements must exist for the
prompt provision of any necessary eligibility information concerning participation or availability. States also
will need to establish methods of administration for obtaining this information when claimants are attending ``similar
services'' as discussed in item 11.b.



Further, as discussed in item 12 below, States must provide information to this Department related to reemployment
services received by claimants and employment outcomes. Arrangements must be made for the provision of this information.



6. 

Definition of ``Reemployment Services.''

 The second conference report for Public Law 103-152, which added Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) to the SSA,
describes ``reemployment services'' as including_






Job search assistance and job placement services, such as counseling, testing, and providing occupational and labor
market information, assessment, job search workshops, job clubs and referrals to employers, and other similar services.
[H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1993)]






Reemployment services need not include skills and education training. Therefore, States are not required to apply
the participation requirement discussed in item 11.a. to such training even if claimants are referred to such training
through the worker profiling and reemployment services system.



Orientation and assessment activities are both reemployment services for purposes of Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j)
SSA. Orientation is a service since claimants are made aware of why services are available and what the services are
and, as a result, are able to participate in the identification of appropriate services to assist them in returning
to employment. Assessment is a service since it identifies the specific needs of each claimant. Assessment is also
listed as a reemployment service in the Committee Report.



7. 

Benefit Rights Interview (BRI).

 Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, individuals who may be entitled to UI must be provided information
as will reasonably afford them an opportunity to know, establish and protect their rights under the UI law of the State.
Therefore, BRI information provided to claimants during the initial claims taking process must advise claimants
of the possible consequences of failure to report or to participate in any reemployment services to which they may
be referred.

8. 

Identifying Claimants Likely to Exhaust and in Need of Reemployment Services



a. Who is to be Profiled.

 Section 303(j)(1)(A), SSA, requires that State agencies establish and utilize a system of profiling ``all new claimants
for regular compensation'' (i.e., regular UI) that ``identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular
compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment.'' Based
on the plain language of Section 303(j)(1)(A), all claimants for regular UI must be profiled.



The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in Section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual
under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85),
* * * other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Through the reference to 5
U.S.C. chapter 85, the phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation'' includes claimants filing for UI for
ex-servicemembers (UCX) and Federal employees (UCFE). The phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation''
includes all intrastate, interstate and combined-wage claimants.



The Department will work with the States in developing arrangements for profiling interstate claimants. In determining
whether to take action against a State which is not profiling and referring interstate claimants, the Department
will take into account the feasibility of such State taking appropriate action.



b. 

Who is to be Identified.

 The profiling system must be structured so as to identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UI and will
need job search assistance services to make successful transition to new employment. If a claimant is not permanently
laid off, there is no need for job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment'' and the likelihood of
exhaustion also decreases. Similarly, if jobs exist in the current industry or occupation, then the claimant is less
likely to exhaust and to need job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment.'' The word ``transition''
as used in Section 303(j)(1), SSA, indicates that the requirement for participation in reemployment services is
not aimed at claimants who are merely between jobs in the same industry or occupation, but instead at claimants who
are having to make a ``transition'' to jobs in a different industry or occupation.

<PARENT> FR940902-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As a result of this analysis, the Department has determined the following minimum requirement: A State profiling
system must identify all new claimants for regular UI who are permanently laid off (and who are, therefore, likely
to exhaust). From the claimants so identified, the State must further identify at least one of the following: (1) Those
claimants who are unlikely to return to their previous industry or (2) those claimants who are unlikely to return to
their previous occupation.
Claimants identified under the minimum required profiling system described above will also be ``eligible dislocated
workers'' under Section 303(a)(1)(A) of Title III, JTPA. This section defines the term ``eligible dislocated workers''
to mean individuals who ``have been terminated or laid off or who have received a notice of termination or layoff from
employment, are eligible for or have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment compensation, and are unlikely
to return to their previous industry or occupation.'' Claimants identified through the minimum profiling system
described above are_as are certain ``eligible dislocated workers''_permanently laid off from employment, eligible
for UI, and unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. Therefore, claimants identified through
the minimum required profiling system will also be ``eligible dislocated workers'' for purposes of Title III, JTPA.
c. 

How Claimants are to be Identified
(1) Variables. 

The use of certain types of variables is required to ensure that claimants identified are permanently laid off and
unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. The use of other variables is optional. In addition,
the use of certain variables is prohibited.



Under the minimum required profiling system, the following variables must be used:



 

First Payment for Total or Part-Total Unemployment: 

Since claimants cannot exhaust UI unless they are first eligible for UI, the use of this variable is required. Claimants
receiving first payments for partial claims are not required to be identified for referral since there has been no
separation from employment.
First payment to some claimants will occur late in their claims series due to appeals, wage investigations or other
causes. Since, as noted in item 8.a, ``all new claimants'' for UI must be profiled, claimants receiving late payments
must be profiled. However, given that the profiling system's goal of early intervention will not be achieved for these
claimants, States have the option of introducing an additional variable to the profiling system which would exclude
claimants who receive first payments after a certain period of time (for example, 5 weeks).
 

Recall Status: 

Since claimants who are on recall will not need reemployment services and are less likely to exhaust UI, the use of this
variable is required.
 

Hiring Halls: 

Claimants making exclusive use of a union hiring hall will not need reemployment services since these claimants are
expecting to find work in their current occupation. If union hiring halls are used in the State, then the State must
use this variable.



Claimants remaining after these three variables are applied will be passed through either a statistical modeling
or characteristic screening process to determine difficulty in finding reemployment. (See item 8.c.(2) below.)
Following are variables which the Department has identified for use in this process:



 

Education: 

Educational level is closely associated with reemployment difficulty. Generally, claimants with less education
are more likely to exhaust. Use of this variable is a State option.
 

Job Tenure: 

This is a measure of a claimant's attachment to a specific employer. Studies show that the longer a worker's specific
job attachment, the more difficult it is to find equivalent employment elsewhere. Use of this variable is a State option.
 

Industry: 

A claimant's search for employment is affected by the former industry of employment. Claimants who worked in industries
that are declining, relative to others in the State, experience greater difficulty in obtaining new employment than
claimants who worked in expanding industries. States must use either this variable or ``occupation.''
 

Occupation: 

Workers in low demand occupations experience greater reemployment difficulty than workers in occupations with
higher demand. States must use either this variable or ``industry.''
 

Uemployment Rate: 

Dislocation and reemployment difficulty are closely related to economic conditions, as measured by unemployment
rates. In areas with high unemployment, unemployed workers will have greater difficulty becoming reemployed than
those workers in areas with low unemployment, even if all other conditions are equal. Use of this variable is a State
option.



To summarize, under the minimum required profiling system, States must use first payment, recall status, hiring
halls (if they are used in the State), and either industry or occupation to identify claimants for purposes of referral
to reemployment services. Using the above optional variables will decrease the number identified under the profiling
system; however, the result will be a greater precision in identification. The Department will notify States if any
additional optional variables are identified.
Finally, a profiling system may not produce results which discriminate in violation of any Federal or State law or
which otherwise unfairly favors some claimants over those similarly situated with respect to their need for reemployment
services. To this end, under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D), SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish
other requirements as are determined appropriate, the Department has determined that the following elements may
not be used in the profiling system: Age, race, ethnic group, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion,
political affiliation and citizenship.
(2) 

Statistical Modeling versus Characteristic Screening. 

Statistical modeling uses a set of variables in combination simultaneously. Each variable receives a weight (or
``coefficient'') that has been established by a statistical process. The weighted average produces a ranking. Characteristic
screening, on the other hand, uses each variable as an exclusion variable. That is, depending on whether the answer
is ``yes'' or ``no'' to a given question, claimants will be either included or excluded. Unlike statistical screening,
no ranking is produced.
Referral to services based on statistical modeling will be based on a numerical score since the higher the score, the
more likely the claimant will exhaust and the greater the need for services. If claimants have the same scores, and
there are not sufficient opportunities to participate in reemployment services, States must randomly select among
those claimants for referral to assure claimants are treated equitably and the profiling system is legally defensible.
Since claimants identified through characteristic screening cannot be ranked, States using this system must also
randomly select from among the identified claimants for referrals. Under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D),
SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish other requirements as are determined appropriate, the Department has
determined that random selection is required for use in profiling systems.

<TEXT>
 

The Department encourages the use of statistical models since they are more efficient and precise in identifying
claimants as well as easier to manage and adapt. However, States may use characteristic screening. Whichever system
is used, each State must assure that the system implemented in fact identifies claimants who are permanently laid
off and unlikely to return to work in either their previous industry or occupation.

9. 

The Selection Pool. 

Under the profiling system anticipated by the Department (see item 4), all claimants identified in accordance with
the requirements of Section 303(j)(1), SSA, will be either immediately referred to reemployment services or, if
services are not available, placed in a selection pool. Claimants in the selection pool may be referred to services
at a latter date.

As noted in the background section, early intervention is one of the principal aims of the worker profiling and reemployment
services initiative. Holding claimants in the pool for more than a minimum period of time will not achieve this early
intervention. Therefore, the Department recommends that claimants be removed from the selection pool after 4 weeks.

In addition, the Department recognizes that large-scale permanent layoffs and plant closings do not occur at regular
intervals. Therefore, there may be times when a State elects to retain claimants in the pool for longer periods. States
may also elect to vary the length of time individuals are held in the pool by locality within the State.

10. 

Notifications of Referrals to Reemployment Services. 

Notification to claimants of referrals to reemployment services should occur 

only 

if a referral is actually made. (It is not necessary to notify claimants that they have been placed in the selection
pool since they are not required to take any action until a referral is made.) These notification and referral notices
must be in writing and must advise claimants:




 That they have been identified as likely to need reemployment services in order to make a successful transition
to new employment.

 When and where to report for the services.

 To bring all relevant information concerning ongoing or recently completed reemployment services or current
training in which they have participated and believe would help them return to work. Alternatively, States may choose
to have certain claimants, such as those already in training, contact the UI agency first. Either way, the notice must
clearly explain what information the claimant is expected to provide and to whom.

 That failure to participate in reemployment services may result in denial of UI.




Each State must maintain a record of each claimant referral notification in the same manner that it would any other
formal correspondence that is pertinent to the adjudication of UI eligibility issues.

11. 

Adjudication of Issues Associated With Profiling and Reemployment Services
a. Participation Requirement. 

Section 303(a)(10), SSA, creates a requirement that ``as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for
any week, any claimant who has been referred to reemployment services * * * participate in such services
or similar services.'' (Emphasis added.) The Department interprets the phrase ``for any week'' to mean that a claimant
must participate in reemployment services (as defined in item 6 above) only during the week or weeks that the claimant
is required to attend. Therefore, eligibility with respect to participation in reemployment services is determined
on a weekly basis.
Claimants must be held ineligible for any week in which there is a failure to participate in reemployment services
which they are required to attend unless they: have justifiable cause, have completed such services, or are attending
similar services, as discussed below. Federal law does not require, however, that the maximum UI benefit amount be
reduced.
Federal law does not require State UI laws to provide for a finding of ineligibility when claimants are no longer required
to participate. For example, a claimant may refuse to participate during one week and be held ineligible for that week.
If the claimant is required to participate the next week and again refuses, then the claimant will continue to be ineligible.
However, if the claimant is not required to participate the next week, then there is no failure to participate and the
State is not required to find the claimant ineligible. Similarly, a claimant who has refused to participate in available
services and has been held ineligible may later agree to participate. In this case, if the services are no longer available
to the claimant, Federal law does not require the claimant to be held ineligible for any additional weeks since there
is no longer a failure to participate.
There is also no failure to participate when the service provider relieves claimants of the requirement that they
attend. This may occur when, for example, a claimant notifies a provider of an inability to participate due to a family
emergency and the service provider advises the claimant that it is not necessary to participate. (Note: This may raise
an availability issue for the week(s) in question. This is why service providers must provide information concerning
availability under item 5.b. above.)
Claimants are not required to be held ineligible if the failure to participate is minimal and does not significantly
affect their ability to benefit from the reemployment services in attempting to obtain new work. For example, if a
claimant misses one hour of an eight hour seminar, the State may find that this limited absence is not a failure to participate.
b. 

Similar Services. 

Under Section 303(a)(10), SSA, a claimant referred under the profiling system is not required to participate in reemployment
services if the claimant is participating in ``similar services.'' 
``Similar services'' are reemployment services that claimants are attending on their own initiative. Examples
of ``similar services'' include, but are not limited to, services offered by a company prior to a permanent layoff
or services offered by private employment agencies. The ``similar services'' need not be identical to those to which
the claimant was referred by the State; they need be only reasonably similar. The quality of the services being provided
should be a relevant factor in determining whether the services are ``similar.''
Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, the UI agency is required to obtain and record such information
as will reasonably insure the payment of benefits to individuals when due. Therefore, the UI agency must perform sufficient
factfinding to determine if, in fact, the services are similar. This means the UI agency must determine, among other
things, to what services the claimant was referred and what the ``similar services'' are which the claimant is (or
will be) attending.
c. 

Exceptions to Participation Requirement. 

Section 303(a)(10), SSA, contains two exceptions to the participation requirement. The first is whether the claimant
has completed such services. The second is whether ``justifiable cause'' exists for the claimant's failure to participate
in the services. (Note: As indicated in item 11.b, there is no participation requirement if claimants are participating
in similar services.)
(1) 

Completion of ``Such Services.'' 

Section 303(a)(10)(A) provides that a claimant who has completed ``such services'' is not required to participate
in services to which the claimant has been referred. How recently the services were completed should be considered
in making this determination since, for example, certain approaches to finding a job may have changed due to changing
labor market conditions. Although the language ``such services'' appears to refer to those services to which the
claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar services.'' Therefore, the Department
interprets Section 303(a)(10)(A), SSA, as allowing States to consider the completion of ``similar services'' as
the completion of ``such services.''
(2) 

Justifiable Cause. 

Section 303(a)(10)(B) provides that a claimant who has ``justifiable cause'' is not required to participate in services
to which the claimant has been referred. As noted in (1) above, although the language ``such services'' appears to
refer to those services to which the claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar
services.'' Otherwise, claimants attending ``similar services'' would not be relieved of the requirement to participate
when justifiable cause exists. Therefore, the Department interprets Section 303(a)(10)(B), SSA, as allowing States
to consider justifiable cause as a reason for not participating in ``similar services.''
For purposes of ensuring consistency with Section 303(a)(10), SSA, States must apply the ``reasonable person''
test in determining if justifiable cause exists for failure to participate. That is, States must determine if the
reasons offered by claimants for failure to participate are such that a reasonable person would not have participated.
As in other areas where the ``reasonable person'' test is used, such as failure to report to the UI office as required,
States must expect the claimants take the actions a prudent and reasonable person would take prior to concluding that
participation is not possible. For example, although a reasonable person would not be expected to leave children
at home unattended, a reasonable person would also be expected to make an effort to obtain child care. 
A finding of justifiable cause will last only for the period the justifiable cause is relevant. For example, justifiable
cause due to short term illness will last only for the period of the illness. There may be cases when the State determines
that the justifiable cause continues for a longer period or through the life of the claim, for example, when the claimant
is in approved training under State law. (Note: The Department anticipates that claimants in approved training will
not be required to participate in reemployment services while they are in training.)
d. 

Relation of Participation Requirement to Other State Eligibility Requirements. 

Depending on the nature and extent of the reemployment services in which the claimant is participating, States should
apply other eligibility requirements in such a way as to not overly burden the claimant. For example, the State may
choose to reduce the number of work search contacts required or relieve the claimant of the work search requirement
during a period of participation in reemployment services, as appropriate.

<PARENT> FR940902-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As noted in UIPL 13-94, Change 1, the justifiable cause exception does not supersede State able and available
requirements, but rather is an additional eligibility requirement related to participation in reemployment services.
Claimants may be determined to have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services; however,
they must still meet a State's able and available requirements to be eligible for UI. For example, although a claimant
who is ill may have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services, the claimant is still subject
to the State's able and available requirements and may, as a result, be ineligible for UI. 

e. 

Appeal Rights.

 Under paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 303(a), SSA, any eligibility determination that a claimant has failed to participate
in reemployment services must be appealable. In addition, all determinations of UI eligibility must contain appeal
rights in accordance with the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations. 

Although States must allow claimants to appeal denials for failure to participate in orientation and assessment,
States are not required to permit claimants to contest the propriety of the referral to orientation and assessment.
Orientation and assessment are aimed at determining what, if any, additional reemployment services may be needed
by the claimants. Obviously, if claimants do not report, this determination cannot be made. In this regard, referrals
to orientation and assessment are similar to reporting and ``call-in'' requirements. 

Claimants must, however, be allowed to question whether any services tailored to the individual are, in fact, needed.
If any evidence appears at any stage of the nonmonetary determination or appeals process indicating that the claimant
does not need these services, the UI agency must take the initiative in determining whether the referral was proper.
If it is found not to be proper, then the participation requirement does not apply and there is no need to address exceptions
such as justifiable cause. 

12. 

Feedback and Reporting.

 Section 303(j)(1)(C), SSA, requires that States collect follow-up information relating to the reemployment services
received by the referred claimants and the employment outcomes for these claimants. This information is to be used
in refining the profiling system. Section 303(a)(6), SSA, also requires the States to provide ``such reports, in
such form and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require * * *.''


Under these authorities, States will be required to submit information concerning profiling to the Department.
This UIPL does not address what information must be collected or reported. Specific instructions for reporting any
information on services and outcomes will be issued as changes to ETA Handbook 401, ``Unemployment Insurance Reports
Handbook''. 

13. 

Action Required.

 Administrators are requested to provide this information to the staff developing the worker profiling and reemployment
services system. 

14. 

Inquiries.

 Inquiries should be directed to the appropriate Regional Office.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

BMJ Financial Corp. Deferred Savings Plan (the Plan), Located in Bordentown, New Jersey


[Application No. D-9732] 


Proposed Exemption


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions
of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the past acquisition
of certain stock rights (the Rights) by the Plan pursuant to a stock rights offering (the Offering) by BMJ Financial
Corporation (BMJ) to shareholders of record as of February 9, 1993 of BMJ common stock (the Common Stock); (2) the holding
of the Rights by the Plan during the subscription period of the Offering; and (3) the past exercise of the Rights by the
Plan; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:



(1) The Plan's acquisition and holding of the Rights occurred in connection with the Offering made available to all
shareholders of the Common Stock;
(2) The Plan's acquisition and holding of the Rights resulted from an independent act of BMJ as a corporate entity,
and all holders of Common Stock, including the Plan, were treated in the same manner with respect to the Offering; and

(3) The authority for all decisions regarding the acquisition, holding and control of the Rights by the Plan was exercised
by an independent fiduciary which made determinations as to whether and how the Plan should exercise or sell the Rights
acquired through the Offering.

4. Under the terms of the Rights offer (the Offering), each shareholder received 0.56 Rights for each share of Common
Stock held as of the close of business on Tuesday, February 9, 1993 (the Record Date). The Rights were treated as separate
securities under federal securities laws and were traded on the NASDAQ national market system separately from the
Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Offering, the Rights were exercisable until 5:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Monday,
March 15, 1993. Thereafter, any unexercised Rights expired and became worthless. Each Right conferred upon the registered
holder thereof the right (the Basic Privilege) to purchase one share of Common Stock at a stated exercise price of $4.75
per share (the Exercise Price). Each Right also carried with it the nontransferable right to subscribe, at the Exercise
Price, for the shares underlying any Rights that remained unexercised upon the expiration of the Offering on March
15, 1993, subject to proration (the Oversubscription Privilege).

2 

Only holders of Common Stock who exercised all their Rights pursuant to the Basic Privilege were entitled to subscribe
for shares pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege.




A total of 3,176,144 shares of the Common Stock were issued by BMJ pursuant to the Offering. Of this total, 2,444,565
shares were issued through the exercise of Rights, with 2,100,433 shares purchased through the Basic Privilege and
344,132 shares purchased through the Oversubscription Privilege. The remaining 731,579 shares of the total sold
pursuant to the Offering were sold pursuant to standby purchase agreements with eight standby purchasers. Executive
officers and members of the board of directors of BMJ purchased 207,883 shares of the Common Stock issued pursuant
to the Offering. Gross proceeds generated by BMJ from the Offering totalled $15,086,684, including $3,470,000 raised
through standby purchase agreements. All sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Offering were made at the Exercise
Price, $4.75 per share. On February 8, 1993, prior to the Record Date, the Common Stock closed on the NASDAQ system at
a price of $8.88 per share. The Plan received 68,343 Rights as a result of the Offering because the Plan had held 122,042
shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. 
5. The Fiduciary represents that it exercised due diligence to determine the most prudent response to the Offering
on behalf of the Plan, and that all information relevant to the Offering was analyzed, including the following: (a)
The terms of the Plan and its trust document; (b) the economic impact on the Plan under various alternatives, including
selling the Rights, exercising the Rights, taking no action and any combination of these alternatives; (c) the cash
balances available to the Plan, the Plan's expected cash flow and the Plan's ability to borrow cash; (d) the likely
value of the Oversubscription Privilege and the likelihood of any shares becoming available thereunder; and (e)
the procedures and methodology of the Offering. 
On the basis of its considerations of all options available to the Plan under the circumstances prevailing at the time
of the Offering, the Fiduciary represents that it determined that the most prudent course of action was for the Plan
to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all 68,343 Rights issued to the Plan. To do so, the Plan needed $324,629.25
in cash, which was $263,335.49 more than the Plan ultimately received in cash matching contributions before the close
of the Offering on March 15, 1993. In order to generate the additional cash needed to exercise the Rights, the Fiduciary
determined that the Plan should sell a portion of the Common Stock held by the Plan. In addition, the Fiduciary also
determined that the Plan should borrow $60,000, if possible, to acquire an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock,
if such shares became available to the Plan pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege. Although the Plan had additional
shares of Common Stock it could sell to raise the cash necessary to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege, the Fiduciary
represents that it had determined that very few shares of additional Common Stock would become available pursuant
to the Oversubscription Privilege, and that the transaction costs involved in the Plan selling the additional shares
were not justified. The Fiduciary determined that a short-term loan, on the other hand, permitted the Plan to raise
the necessary cash at relatively modest cost.

The Fiduciary states that once it had made the foregoing determinations, it directed the Committee and the Trustee
to take the following steps: (1) Immediately sell 38,000 shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ system for $7.00 per share,
which was the net price per share prevailing on the NASDAQ on March 4, 1993, the day the instructions were received;
(2) Apply the sales proceeds and the cash matching contributions to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all
Rights issued to the Plan at a cost of $324,629.25; and (3) If possible, borrow $60,000 (the Loan) and apply the Loan
proceeds to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege for an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock, subject to
the following conditions: (a) The Loan was not to be outstanding for more than 30 days; (b) To the extent some or all of
the 12,500 shares did not become available pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, the remaining Loan proceeds
were to be applied to repay the unused portion of the Loan. 
According to the Fiduciary's instructions, the Trustee and the Committee executed the sale of 38,000 shares of Common
Stock and purchased 68,343 shares of Common Stock at the Exercise Price by exercising the Basic Privilege on behalf
of the Plan. However, because an unrelated lender could not be located to make the Loan to the Plan, the Fiduciary directed
the Trustee and the Committee not to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege. 
6. The applicant represents that as a result of participating in the Offering as directed by the Fiduciary, the Plan
realized a net gain of $182,027.70. Prior to the Offering, the Plan held 122,042 shares of Common Stock and was scheduled
to receive cash matching contributions of $61,293.76 before the end of the Offering. The applicant explains that
the Plan's normal practice would have been to invest the cash matching contributions in Common Stock through a dividend
reinvestment program on the 10th day of the month following the date on which the contribution was received. If the
Plan had not participated in the Offering and instead had followed its normal practice, the Plan would have held 128,700
shares of Common Stock, plus $12,261.05 in cash, at the end of the Offering on March 15, 1993. BMJ states that these assets
would have had a fair market value on that date of $1,039,717.05. By participating in the Offering as directed by the
Fiduciary, the Plan instead held 153,385 shares of Common Stock, plus $2,664.51 in cash, at the end of the Offering
on March 15, 1993, resulting in total Plan assets with a fair market value of $1,221,744.75. 
7. The applicant states that the issuance of the Rights to the Plan resulted from unilateral, independent actions
of BMJ, and that the Plan, as an owner of Common Stock, received the Rights on the same basis as all other Common Stock
owners. The applicant explains that the purpose of the Offering was to generate necessary capital for BMJ and that
the inevitable effect of issuing new shares of Common Stock was the dilution of the proportionate interest in the corporation
represented by all previously-issued shares. Accordingly, Common Stock owners who failed to exercise the Rights
could be expected to experience a diminution in their proportionate interest in BMJ and a decrease in the value of their
Common Stock shares. Common Stock owners who exercised their Rights could avoid such reductions of interest and value,
and could potentially experience a net gain. The applicant notes that the Fiduciary determined that the most prudent
course of action for the Plan with respect to the Offering was to participate by exercising the Rights to the maximum
extent possible. 
8. In summary, the applicant represents that the transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for
the following reasons: (a) The Plan's receipt of the Rights through the Offering resulted from unilateral, independent
actions of BMJ with the sole intent of generating necessary additional capital; (b) The Plan received the Rights,
and was accorded treatment under the Offering, on the same basis as all other owners of Common Stock as of the Record
Date of the Offering; (c) The interests of the Plan with respect to the Rights and the Offering were represented independently
of BMJ, by the Fiduciary, who had sole responsibility with respect to the Plan's actions regarding the Rights; and
(d) The Fiduciary determined that the most prudent course of action on behalf of the Plan with respect to the Offering
was the exercise of the Rights to the maximum extent possible.

H. Stephen Cranston Professional Corporation Pension Plan and Trust (the Plan), Located in San Marino, California




[Application No. D-9733] 



Proposed Exemption



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted
the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) of certain real property (the Property) by the Plan
to H. Stephen Cranston and Karen Y. Cranston, husband and wife, and disqualified persons with respect to the Plan;
provided that (1) the Sale is a one-time transaction for cash; (2) the Plan does not experience any loss nor incur any
expenses from the proposed transaction; and (3) the Plan receives as consideration from the Sale the greater of either
(a) the fair market value of the Property as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser on the date of the Sale,
or (b) an amount equal to all the funds expanded by the Plan in acquiring and maintaining the Property during its period
of ownership. 



Summary of Facts and Representations



1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan that has one participant, H. Stephen Cranston. As of March 31, 1993, the total assets
of the Plan were $748,627. The fiduciaries of the Plan, who have investment discretion over the assets of the Plan,
are H. Stephen Cranston and his wife, Karen Y. Cranston, who are also the applicants for the exemption. 

The sponsoring employer of the plan is a California professional corporation which is designated as H. Stephen Cranston
Professional Corporation. It is engaged in the practice of general business law with its offices in San Marino, California.
H. Stephen Cranston is the sole shareholder and only employee.

3 






2. The Property consists of 59.9 acres of forested land that is located in Linn County on 48063 Cascadia Drive, Cascadia,
Oregon. The improvements on the Property are a 67 year old two-story house with a detached barn and shed. The house is
represented by the applicants to be in a deplorable condition and uninhabitable. There is no available drinking water,
the prior occupants destroyed the furnace for heating the house, and the septic tank needs to be replaced. There is
no basement under the house and the wood foundation, which is riddled with termites and dry rot, is braced to avoid collapsing.



The Property was appraised by Scott Lepman, SRA, RM of Albany, Oregon, an independent appraiser, who determined,
as of March 18, 1994, that the Property had a fair market value of $128,000. Among other things, Mr. Lepman determined
that the Property would not qualify for bank financing; and also, he observed many structural defects on the Property:
the buildings need painting; the sunporch needs to be finished; the ceiling in the living room is in disrepair; the
walls in several rooms need repairing; and the house's foundation is structurally unsound. He also observed functional
obsolence such as, the house has unevenly settled and has no conventional source for heating. 
Mr. Lepman also indicated that the barn and shed are in disrepair. 

Mr. Lepman described the location of the Property, which is surrounded by forest land, to be in a mixed neighborhood
of poor to good dwellings that vary in age and design, and are predominately located on large parcels that are devoted
to agricultural and timber production. Mr. Lepman referred to the properties in the area as below average in visual
appeal and in level of maintenance. He further stated that the area is an older rural community with a declining timber
base due to the enforced governmental protections of the spotted owl. 

3. The Property was purchased by the Plan on July 30, 1990, from Charlie West and Lorraine West, husband and wife, for
the total consideration of $70,000. The Wests are represented by the applicants as unrelated persons with respect
to the Plan and its sole participant. 

The applicants represent that the purchase of the Property was made by the Plan with the intention that the timber on
the Property would be cut and sold over a number of years for a profitable return to the Plan. During 1992, the Plan had
cut approximately 40 percent of the timber on the Property for a net return of $43,646.32 after expenses. 

Since the cutting in 1992, the applicants represent that circumstances have curtailed further timber cutting. One
intervening condition has been the recent reporting of spotted owls in the area followed by the imposition of governmental
regulations precluding the cutting of timber and destroying the owl's habitat. Another curtailment to cutting timber
on the Property is the State of Oregon requirements that all trees cut must be replaced with new trees that survive for
at least five years. The applicants represent that because of the steep and uneven contours of the Property the survival
of new trees is precarious and uncertain. Also, after the replanting there is a need for the services of a professional
forester to care for the new plantings for an additional three years. 

Since the Plan purchased the Property in 1990 for $70,000 and incurred legal fees of $262.35, the applicants represent
that the Plan has expended an additional sum of $15,794.38 for repairs and maintenance of the Property. The expenses
to the Plan included such things as property taxes, roof repairs, weed and rubbish removal, electrical repairs, fence
and gate repairs, chimney removal, materials and labor for bracing the foundation of house, and security services.


4. The applicants propose that the Property be sold to them for the higher of either its fair market value or for the total
amount of funds expended by the Plan acquiring and maintaining the Property, so that the Plan can avoid the continuing
expenses of repairing, reforesting, and maintaining the Property. In addition, the Plan will be able to invest the
funds from the Sale in liquid assets that generate yields and incur less expenses. The applicants state that the Plan
will incur no expenses nor any losses from the proposed transaction. 

The applicants represent that the proposed transaction will be in the best interests of the Plan and its participant
and beneficiaries because it is unlikely that the Property can be sold to persons unrelated to the Plan. The applicants
represent, and the appraiser corroborates, that the Property is not habitable and the availability of bank financing
for the purchase of the Property is not foreseeable. Also, the likelihood of finding a purchaser in the area with adequate
cash is represented to be remote because of the high unemployment in the area due to logging restrictions involving
the ecological problem of the spotted owl.

The applicants who are the only persons affected by the proposed transaction desire that the proposed transaction
be consummated. 

5. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transaction will satisfy the criteria of section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code because (a) the Sale of the Property involves a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan will not incur
any expenses from the Sale; (c) the Plan will receive as consideration from the Sale the greater of either the fair market
value of the Property as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser on the date of the Sale, or an amount equal
to all the funds expended by the Plan in acquiring and maintaining the Property during its period of ownership; (d)
the Sale will permit the Plan to reinvest illiquid assets into income producing, liquid assets; and (e) the Plan will
avoid the expenses and risks involved in maintaining and developing the Property. 




NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS: 

Since the applicants are the only persons affected by the proposed transaction, there is no need to distribute notice
to interested persons. Comments are due 30 days after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.A. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(E),
406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate on behalf of an Excluded Plan by any person who has
discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of that Excluded Plan.
 





B. Effective June 28, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by
section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code shall not apply to: 

(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and a plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the investment of plan assets in the certificates is (a) an obligor with respect to 5 percent or less
of the fair market value of obligations or receivables contained in the trust, or (b) an affiliate of a person described
in (a); if: 

(i) the plan is not an Excluded Plan; 

(ii) solely in the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initial issuance of the certificates,
at least 50 percent of each class of certificates in which plans have invested is acquired by persons independent of
the members of the Restricted Group and at least 50 percent of the aggregate interest in the trust is acquired by persons
independent of the Restricted Group; 

(iii) a plan's investment in each class of certificates does not exceed 25 percent of all of the certificates of that
class outstanding at the time of the acquisition; and 

(iv) immediately after the acquisition of the certificates, no more than 25 percent of the assets of a plan with respect
to which the person has discretionary authority or renders investment advice are invested in certificates representing
an interest in a trust containing assets sold or serviced by the same entity.
 For purposes of this paragraph B.(1)(iv) only, an entity will not be considered to service assets contained in a trust
if it is merely a subservicer of that trust; 





(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates,
provided that the conditions set forth in paragraphs B.(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) are met; and 

(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.B. (1) or (2). 

C. Effective June 28, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed
by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code, shall not apply to transactions in connection
with the servicing, management and operation of a trust, provided: 

(1) such transactions are carried out in accordance with the terms of a binding pooling and servicing arrangement;
and 

(2) the pooling and servicing agreement is provided to, or described in all material respects in the prospectus or
private placement memorandum provided to, investing plans before they purchase certificates issued by the trust.
 





Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S.

D. Effective June 28, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by sections
4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to any transactions
to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest
or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services to the plan (or
by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Act
or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates. 



II. General Conditions




A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 

(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 

(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D&P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 

(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 

(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 

(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation
D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 

B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates
has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire
certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not
satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such condition
is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates,
the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such
condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser
(or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee a representation
regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required to make a written representation
regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above.

delivery of certificates from, the other party).

R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c-2.

S. 

Qualified Administrative Fee

 means a fee which meets the following criteria:

(1) the fee is triggered by an act or failure to act by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts owing
in respect of the obligations;

(2) the servicer may not charge the fee absent the act or failure to act referred to in (1);

(3) the ability to charge the fee, the circumstances in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee
is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement; and

 means a lease of a motor vehicle where:

(a) the trust holds a security interest in the lease;

(b) the trust holds a security interest in the leased motor vehicle; and

Trust Assets



2. The Applicants seek exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided
interests in the following categories of trusts: (1) single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage
investment trusts;

7

 (2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and
(4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts.

8








3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages
are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation
of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the
pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided
by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages
will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.

9







Trust Structure



4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The
sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have
been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender
and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer.

On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes
the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal
title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust
assets. The certificates are either publicly or privately offered.

Certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly or quarterly installments of principal and/or interest, or
lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the pass-through
rate_which may be fixed or variable.

A segregated account is established in the name of the trustee or the servicer (in either case, on behalf of certificateholders)
to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of the trustee or the servicer,
as applicable, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparable
to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make a single deposit into
the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligors by the servicer
may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event will the period of time between
receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account exceed 45 days.

5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. The Applicants request exemptive relief for two types
of multi-class certificates: ``strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/ slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates
are a type of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments
and separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of
principal and interest.

10 






``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities
or the same maturities with different payment schedules. In certain transactions of this type, interest and/or principal
payments received on the underlying receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest
stated maturity of principal, and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates has been
paid in full (or has received a specified amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates.
Distributions on certificates having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders
have been paid in full. The only difference between this multi-class pass-through arrangement and a single-class
pass-through arrangement is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case, certificateholders
will have a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing
a certificate be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying
obligations. In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount
required to be so distributed, all senior certificateholders then entitled to receive distributions will share
in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis.

11 






6. For tax reasons, the trust must be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion
and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing
agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation
discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates. Any receivable so substituted is required
to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy as
the replaced receivable. 
In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected
receivable and passed through to certificateholders. 


Parties to Transactions 


7. The 

originator 

of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile
purchaser, or leases property to the lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell
it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor. 
Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course
of their business, including finance companies for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations,
financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind
of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations.
Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the
trust sponsor or servicer. 
8. The 

sponsor 

will be GECMSI. Where the sponsor is not also the servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring
the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables
to the trust. 
9. The 

trustee 

of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents
and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in
favor of certificateholders.

<TEXT>
 

The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to the trust sponsor, the servicer or underwriter
or placement agent. The Applicants represent that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust
company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer,
sponsor or out of trust assets. The method of compensating the trustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing
agreement and disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.

10. The 

servicer 

of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically
involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments
received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where
a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common
for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service''
the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted,
a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's
perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments
from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. 
In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though
they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to the underwriter or the placement agent. In other cases, however,
GECMSI may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust for which Capital Markets will
be the underwriter or placement agent. 


Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 


11. Where the sponsor of a trust is not the originator of receivables included in a trust, the sponsor generally purchases
the receivables in the secondary market, either directly from the originator or from another secondary market participant.
The price the sponsor pays for a receivable is determined by competitive market forces, taking into account payment
terms, interest rate, quality, and forecasts as to future interest rates. 
As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the
entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives
certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities
underwriters. In some transactions, the sponsor or an affiliate may retain a portion of the certificates for its own
account. In addition, in some transactions the originator may sell receivables to a trust for cash. At the time of the
sale, the trustee would sell certificates to the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the sale to pay
the originator for receivables sold to the trust. The transfer of the receivables to the trust by the sponsor, the sale
of certificates to investors, and the receipt of the cash proceeds by the sponsor generally take place simultaneously.

12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces,
including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on
investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying
receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. 
The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified
servicing fee.

12

 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of
a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon, rate together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases
a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased
at a premium yields less than the stated coupon. 




13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor, and receive fees
for acting in that capacity) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust
and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the
payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support or deposited into
a reserve fund. The servicer may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables
between the time they are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the
pooling and servicing agreement). The servicer will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing
the trust, including, in some cases, the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation. 
The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange
to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees,
and is either paid out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate or paid
in a lump sum at the time the trust is established.

<TEXT>
 

14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party, usually the obligor.
These administrative fees fall into three categories: 
(a) prepayment fees; (b) late payment and payment extension fees and fees related to the modification of the terms
of an obligation as permitted by the provisions of the pooling and servicing agreement (including the partial release
of collateral to the extent provided therein); and (c) fees and charges associated with foreclosure or repossession,
or other conversion of a secured position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation. 
Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described
in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates. 
15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any
date on which pass-through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit
the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts in itself or to commingle such payments with
its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived
from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass-through date. Commingled payments
may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership.
In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with
the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a date specified in the pooling and
servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders. 
16. Underwriters or placement agents will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting or private
placement of certificates. In a firm commitment underwriting, this fee would consist of the difference between what
such underwriter receives for the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates.
In some public offerings, however, an underwriter may sell certificates on an agency basis in a best efforts underwriting.
In those cases, the underwriter would receive an agency commission paid by the sponsor plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket
expenses. In a private placement, the fee normally takes the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor. 


Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer 


17. The Applicants represent that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payment, the cost
of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive at some
point. Consequently, the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the
receivables remaining in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified
percentage (usually 5 to 10 percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid balance. 
The purchase price of a receivable is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and will be at least equal to:
(1) the unpaid principal balance on the receivable plus accrued interest, less any unreimbursed advances of principal
made by the servicer; or (2) the greater of (a) the amount in (1) or (b) the fair market value of such obligations in the
case of a REMIC, or the fair market value of the certificates in the case of a trust that is not a REMIC. 


Certificate Ratings 


18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&P's, Moody's,
D&P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary for
the certificates to attain the desired rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at a level
that is a multiple of the worst historical net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in the issuing
trust. 


Provision of Credit Support 


19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust
(i.e. act as an insurer). In these cases, the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds
to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) out of late payments by the obligors,
(b) from the credit support provider (which may be itself) or, (c) in the case of a trust that issues subordinated certificates,
from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates, and the master servicer will advance
such funds in a timely manner. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support and provides its own funds to cover
defaulted payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its own initiative on behalf of the trustee,
but in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full extent of its obligations under the credit
support mechanism. In some cases, however, the master servicer may not be obligated to advance funds but instead would
be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of its obligations as insurer. However,
a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider of credit support or from future payments
on the affected assets. 
If the master servicer fails to advance funds, fails to call upon the credit support mechanism to provide funds to cover
delinquent payments, or otherwise fails in its duties, the trustee would be required and would be able to enforce the
certificateholders' rights, as both a party to the pooling and servicing agreement and the owner of the trust estate,
including rights under the credit support mechanism. Therefore, the trustee, who is independent of the servicer,
will have the ultimate right to enforce the credit support arrangement.

When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the servicer out of future payments
on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides
credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support
to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount
of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include:

(a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities
are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation; 
(b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period
after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require
the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy
as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible; 
(c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (usually monthly or quarterly as set
forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent trustee
the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information
as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to
deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review
of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer
has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted
under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually
by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that
the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent
accountants' review are delivered to the trustee; and 
(d) Credit support will be provided based upon a specified percentage of the aggregate initial principal balance
of the receivables included in the trust. The credit support is a fixed dollar amount, subject to reduction only for
actual draws thereon, throughout the life of the trust. As a result (subject to draws thereon), the amount of this credit
support will increase as a percentage of the pool principal during the life of the trust. The Applicants represent
that this approach thereby provides investors with greater protection than the approach which permits proportionate
reductions in the credit support, subject to a floor which only is effective towards the end of the life of the trust.



Disclosure 


20. In connection with the original issuance of certificates, the prospectus or private placement memorandum will
be furnished to investing plans. The prospectus or private placement memorandum will contain information material
to a fiduciary's decision to invest in the certificates, including: 
(a) Information concerning the payment terms of the certificates, the rating of the certificates, and any material
risk factors with respect to the certificates; 
(b) A description of the trust as a legal entity and a description of how the trust was formed by the seller/servicer
or other sponsor of the transaction; 
(c) Identification of the independent trustee for the trust; 
(d) A description of the receivables contained in the trust, including the types of receivables, the diversification
of the receivables, their principal terms, and their material legal aspects; 
(e) A description of the sponsor and servicer; 
(f) A description of the pooling and servicing agreement, including a description of the seller's principal representations
and warranties as to the trust assets and the trustee's remedy for any breach thereof; a description of the procedures
for collection of payments on receivables and for making distributions to investors, and a description of the accounts
into which such payments are deposited and from which such distributions are made; identification of the servicing
compensation and any fees for credit enhancement that are deducted from payments on receivables before distributions
are made to investors; a description of periodic statements provided to the trustee, and provided to or made available
to investors by the trustee; and a description of the events that constitute events of default under the pooling and
servicing contract and a description of the trustee's and the investors' remedies incident thereto; 
(g) A description of the credit support; 
(h) A general discussion of the principal federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the pass-through securities by a typical investor; 
(i) A description of the underwriters' plan for distributing the pass-through securities to investors; and 
(j) Information about the scope and nature of the secondary market, if any, for the certificates.

21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least
as frequently as distributions are made to certificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic
information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where
applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables. 

22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer
or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a modification of the disclosure
requirements for annual reports on Form 10-K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would
continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8-K to report material developments concerning
the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting
requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as
to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information
regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies,
servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and
the amount of compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating
agency or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates. 

In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the
trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will include information regarding
the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will typically contain information
regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the guaranty or other credit support
and a breakdown of payments between principal and interest. 



Secondary Market Transactions 



24. It is the policy of many underwriters to attempt to make a market for securities for which it is lead or co-managing
underwriter. It is also the policy of many placement agents to facilitate sales by investors who purchase certificates
if such entity has acted as agent or principal in the original private placement of the certificates and if such investors
request such entity's assistance.

Retroactive Relief 



25. The Applicants represent that they have engaged in transactions related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities based on the assumption that retroactive relief would not be granted. However, it is possible that some
transactions may have occurred that would be prohibited. For example, because many certificates are held in street
or nominee name, it is not always possible to identify whether the percentage interest of plans in a trust is or is not
``significant'' for purposes of the Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3-101(f)).
These problems are compounded as transactions occur in the secondary market. In addition, with respect to the ``publicly-offered
security'' exception contained in that regulation (29 CFR 2510.3-101(b)), it is difficult to determine whether
each purchaser of a certificate is independent of all other purchasers. 

Therefore, the Applicants request relief retroactive for transactions which have occurred on or after June 28, 1994,
the date the Applicants originally filed their exemption application with the Department. 



Summary 




26. In summary, the Applicants represent that the transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the
statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act due to the following: 

(a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute
receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed; 

(b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&P's,
Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating; 

(c) All transactions for which the Applicants seek exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing
agreement, which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates;


(d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for 
sales to plans is substantially limited; and 

(e) Many underwriters have made, and the Applicants anticipate that such underwriters will continue to make, a secondary
market in the publicly-offered certificates sponsored by GECMSI. 



Discussion of Proposed Exemption



I. Differences Between Proposed Exemption and Class Exemption 
PTE 83-1 



The exemptive relief proposed herein is similar to that provided in PTE 
81-7 [46 FR 7520, January 23, 1981], Class Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Mortgage Pool Investment
Trusts, amended and restated as PTE 83-1 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983]. 


PTE 83-1 applies to mortgage pool investment trusts consisting of interest-bearing obligations secured by
first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on single-family residential property. The exemption provides relief
from sections 406(a) and 407 for the sale, exchange or transfer in the initial issuance of mortgage pool certificates
between the trust sponsor and a plan, when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a party-in-interest with
respect to the plan, and the continued holding of such certificates, provided that the conditions set forth in the
exemption are met. PTE 83-1 also provides exemptive relief from section 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act for the
above-described transactions when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a fiduciary with respect to the
plan assets invested in such certificates, provided that additional conditions set forth in the exemption are met.
In particular, section 406(b) relief is conditioned upon the approval of the transaction by an independent fiduciary.
Moreover, the total value of certificates purchased by a plan must not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the issue,
and at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of the issue must be acquired by persons independent of the trust sponsor,
trustee or insurer. Finally, PTE 83-1 provides conditional exemptive relief from section 406 (a) and (b) of
the Act for transactions in connection with the servicing and operation of the mortgage trust. 


Under PTE 83-1, exemptive relief for the above transactions is conditioned upon the sponsor and the trustee
of the mortgage trust maintaining a system for insuring or otherwise protecting the pooled mortgage loans and the
property securing such loans, and for indemnifying certificateholders against reductions in pass-through payments
due to defaults in loan payments or property damage. This system must provide such protection and indemnification
up to an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of all trust mortgages or
the principal balance of the largest mortgage. 

The exemptive relief proposed herein differs from that provided by PTE 
83-1 in the following major respects: (1) The proposed exemption provides individual exemptive relief rather
than class relief; (2) The proposed exemption covers transactions involving trusts containing a broader range of
assets than single-family residential mortgages; (3) Instead of requiring a system for insuring the pooled receivables,
the proposed exemption conditions relief upon the certificates having received one of the three highest ratings
available from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch (insurance or other credit support would be obtained only to
the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired rating); and (4) The proposed exemption provides
more limited section 406(b) and section 407 relief for sales transactions.

II. Ratings of Certificates 


After consideration of the representations of the Applicants and information provided by S&P's, Moody's, D&P
and Fitch, the Department has decided to condition exemptive relief upon the certificates having attained a rating
in one of the three highest generic rating categories from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. The Department believes
that the rating condition will permit the Applicants flexibility in structuring trusts containing a variety of mortgages
and other receivables while ensuring that the interests of plans investing in certificates are protected. The Department
also believes that the ratings are indicative of the relative safety of investments in trusts containing secured
receivables. The Department is conditioning the proposed exemptive relief upon each particular type of asset-backed
security having been rated in one of the three highest rating categories for at least one year and having been sold to
investors other than plans for at least one year.

13






III. Limited Section 406(b) and Section 407(a) Relief for Sales 


The Applicants represent that in some cases a trust sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, and obligor with respect
to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates may be a pre-existing party in interest with
respect to an investing plan.

14 

In these cases, a direct or indirect sale of certificates by that party in interest to the plan would be a prohibited
sale or exchange of property under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act.

15 

Likewise, issues are raised under section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act where a plan fiduciary causes a plan to purchase
certificates where trust funds will be used to benefit a party in interest. 





Additionally, the Applicants represent that a trust sponsor, servicer, trustee, insurer, and obligor with respect
to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates representing an interest in a trust may be a
fiduciary with respect to an investing plan. The Applicants represent that the exercise of fiduciary authority by
any of these parties to cause the plan to invest in certificates representing an interest in the trust would violate
section 406(b)(1), and in some cases section 406(b)(2), of the Act. 
Moreover, the Applicants represent that to the extent there is a plan asset ``look through'' to the underlying assets
of a trust, the investment in certificates by a plan covering employees of an obligor under receivables contained
in a trust may be prohibited by sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act. 
After consideration of the issues involved, the Department has determined to provide the limited sections 406(b)
and 407(a) relief as specified in the proposed exemption.

 

NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS:

 The Applicants represent that because those potentially interested participants and beneficiaries cannot all
be identified, the only practical means of notifying such participants and beneficiaries of this proposed exemption
is by the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. Comments and requests for a hearing must be received by the Department not later than 30 days from the date of publication
of this notice of proposed exemption in the 

Federal Register

.

General Information


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 



Statutory Findings 



In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:

 


(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.




Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Georgia Power Company, et al; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-68 and NPF-81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia.
The proposed amendment will relocate the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.7.10, Area Temperature Monitoring,
to section 16.3 of the VEGP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). With this relocation to the FSAR, GPC plans to clarify
the basis for areas to be monitored and modify these surveillance requirements. This change is being proposed in accordance
with NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants.''
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
The purpose of area temperature monitoring is to provide reasonable assurance that the normal operating temperatures
in the selected rooms will remain consistent with the temperatures assumed for the environmental qualification
of safety related equipment.
The normal operating temperature is significant for its effect on the qualified life of the components as well as the
predicted environmental transients (i.e., pressure, temperature, and radiation) that occur under accident conditions.
The following justifications are provided for the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program:
1. The proposed change to perform temperature surveillance only when the normal ventilation system is out of service
is justified based on the following:
a. The HVAC systems at VEGP have been designed to maintain the room temperatures at less than the maximum normal temperature
specified for environmental qualification purposes. The HVAC calculations have conservatively considered the
worst case heat load conditions with a nominal safety factor when sizing the cooling systems that serve the subject
rooms. As a result, the plant is generally maintained at temperatures well below the level assumed for normal operation
and used for environmental qualification of equipment.
b. Temperature monitoring activities per Technical Specification 3/4.7.10 have been in place for 6 years on Unit
1 and 4 years on Unit 2. The data collected during this time demonstrate that the temperatures have remained well within
environmental qualification limits with the exception of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) area which has exceeded
its reportability limits on several occasions. The MSIV area has since been provided with a new ventilation system
and temperature monitoring instrumentation.
When the normal ventilation system for one of the specified rooms is not functioning, temperature monitoring activities
will resume at the previously specified rate of once every 12 hours. The proposed change to monitor these rooms only
when the normal ventilation system is out of service will provide a level of assurance that is similar to that provided
by the current Technical Specification. Therefore, continued monitoring is not warranted as long as the normal ventilation
systems are functioning.
2. The proposed change in room selection criteria to eliminate rooms that are classified as mild environment is justified
based on the current methods of environmental qualification. The qualified life of safety related equipment in mild
environment is no longer based on environmental qualification, but is based on a combination of design life, trending,
and periodic maintenance and surveillance as discussed in FSAR section 3.11.B. Therefore, the monitoring of mild
rooms is not required to verify that the normal design temperature is being maintained. However, the existing Technical
Specifications not only require monitoring of the normal room temperature, but also require actions to evaluate
equipment operability if an abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded.
To address this abnormal temperature condition, the rooms that are not monitored based on mild environment will not
exceed 150
 F following a complete loss of normal HVAC for a 7-day period.
 The abnormal temperature limits currently shown in the Technical Specifications are the calculated room temperatures
with a loss of normal HVAC for a 24-hour period. The new criterion is based on an equipment qualification analysis that
demonstrates that short duration temperature excursions of up to 24 hours at 150
 F have an insignificant effect on the qualified life of electrical and mechanical equipment. The limitation
is further supported by Appendix F of NUMARC Report 87-00 that concludes that electrical and mechanical equipment
will operate in station blackout conditions with no loss of function with temperatures of up to 150
 F for short durations (i.e., 4 hours).




3. Relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the revision of the TS reporting requirements are justified
as follows:
a. As discussed in enclosure 1 [of the licensee's February 3, 1994 submittal], the existing TS requirements for the
area temperature monitoring program do not meet any of the criteria of the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specification
Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and can safely be relocated to the FSAR.
b. The area temperature monitoring program added to the FSAR will continue to ensure that room temperatures are maintained
within the limits assumed for environmental qualification. The monitoring requirements of once every 12 hours when
the normal ventilation system is not in service will ensure that a room would not experience a short duration temperature
excursion for more than 24 hours without an evaluation of equipment operability. Although reporting requirements
have been excluded from the FSAR description, an evaluation of equipment operability will continue to be performed
in the event that the temperature limits are exceeded. The reporting of operability concerns to the NRC will be based
on the reporting requirements for the specific equipment in an affected area after a determination of operability
has been made. The current TS requires that a report be prepared and submitted to the NRC that demonstrates the continued
operability of the affected equipment if the maximum normal temperature in an area is exceeded for more than 8 hours.
The new FSAR description will continue to require an evaluation of equipment operability if either the normal temperature
limit or abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded. However, no report to the NRC will be required unless the
equipment operability evaluation indicates a reportable condition.
Based on the above considerations, GPC has concluded the following concerning 10 CFR 50.92.
1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The environmental qualification and operability of the safety
related equipment will not be adversely affected by the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program.
The relocation of TS to the FSAR and the changes to monitoring frequency will not increase the probability that the
room temperature design limits will be exceeded or result in a loss of qualified life of safety related equipment.
In addition, the consequences of exceeding the temperature limits will not significantly differ from the existing
program since an evaluation of qualified life and operability will continue to be performed.
2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated. The relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the
changes in monitoring procedures do not change the design of individual equipment, systems, nor the plant operating
procedures and therefore will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those already
evaluated.
3. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety
because the revised monitoring requirements will continue to ensure that the environmental qualification temperature
limits of safety related equipment scoped in the area temperature monitoring program will not be exceeded without
an evaluation of equipment operability.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day period. However, should
circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in
derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. 
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
By October 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Burke County Public Library, 412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro,
Georgia 30830. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Herbert N. Berkow: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Arthur H. Domby, Troutman Sanders, Nations Bank Plaza, 600 Peachtree Street, NE., Atlanta,
Georgia 30308, attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated February 3, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,

<DOCTITLE>University of Washington Research Reactor Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component
Parts and Terminating Facility License</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of Orders authorizing the University
of Washington (the licensee) to dismantle the reactor facility and dispose of the component parts, and termination
of Facility License No. R-73, in accordance with the licensee's application dated August 2, 1994.
The first of these Orders would be issued following the Commission's review and approval of the licensee's detailed
plan for decontamination of the facility and disposal of the radioactive components, or some alternate disposition
plan for the facility. This Order would authorize implementation of the approved plan. Following completion of the
authorized activities and verification by the Commission that acceptable radioactive contamination levels have
been achieved, the Commission would issue a second Order terminating the facility license and any further NRC jurisdiction
over the facility. Prior to issuance of each Order, the Commission will have made the findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.
By October 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the subject Orders and any
person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding
must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall
be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part
2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S.C., chapter 35), the notice announces a request
for reinstatement of an expired clearance for an information collection. Form RI 38-31, We Need More Information
About Your Missing Payment, is sent out by the Retirement and Insurance Group in response to a notification by an individual
of the loss or non-receipt of a payment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The form requests information
needed to enable OPM to trace and/or reissue payment. The information needed to replace a payment must be collected
either verbally or in writing. This collection is still necessary in order for OPM to be able to obtain replacement
payments as needed. This clearance was allowed to expire due to administrative error. 


Approximately 10,000 RI 38-31 forms are processed annually. Of these, approximately 9,800 are reports of missing
checks. A response time for ten minutes per form reporting a missing check is estimated based on the amount of information
required. The annual burden is 1,634 hours. The remainder, 200, are claims for missing electronic transfer payments.
A response time of 30 minutes per form is estimated in these instances. The annual burden is 100 hours. The combined
annual burden is 1,734 hours. 
For copies of this proposal, contact C. Ronald Trueworthy on (703) 908-8550.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Specialist Participation in the After-Hours Trading Facility in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and Investment
Trust Securities Based on Stock Indexes for a One-Year Pilot Period


August 29, 1994.


I. Introduction


On April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed change concerning its After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility (File No. SR-Amex-93-15).
As originally filed, the proposed rule change requested permanent approval of Amex's pilot After-Hours Trading
facility and approval on a pilot basis for specialists in investment trust securities based on stock indexes to participate
in the AHT Facility. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing to request a three-month extension of the pilot
until April 30, 1994, which the Commission approved.
 On May 2, 1994, the Commission granted permanent approval to that portion of File No. SR-Amex-93-15
concerning the Amex's After-Hours Trading facility, not including the specialist participation request.

<TEXT>
 


On August 3, 1993, the Exchange amended the filing to request that specialists in Portfolio Depository Receipts (``PDRs'')
also be permitted to participate in the AHT facility.
 On July 5, 1994, the Exchange amended the proposed rule change to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and
investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34316 (July 5, 1994), 59
FR 35547 (July 12, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change as
amended for a one year period.




II. Description of the Proposal




The Exchange is amending Rules 1300 (``Applicability of 1300 Series'') and 1302 (``After-Hours Trading Orders'')
for a one year pilot period to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities listed pursuant to Section
118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines
 to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the
specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately
prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule
amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance.






The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302(b) to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust
securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility. Currently, Amex Rule 1302(b) provides that
a regular way good 'til cancelled order that is designated as After-Hours eligible, that is on the specialist's limit
order book, and that is executable at the closing price or better, shall migrate from the specialist's limit order
book to the AHT program. Any order for an account in which the specialist member organization or any associated party
has a direct or indirect interest is prohibited from migrating to the AHT program. The rule is being amended to provide
that any order for a Portfolio Depositary Receipt or an investment trust security listed on the Exchange pursuant
to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Standards, Policies and Requirements will not be permitted to migrate to
the AHT program.


The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302 to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate
in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member
organization has a direct or indirect interest.
 For example, under the Exchange's amendment, the specialist in SPDRs would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15
close of the regular trading session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs
for execution in the AHT facility as a closing price coupled order. The Exchange believes that such a capability would
conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities
where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close of the regular trading session to take the contra side of
a customer basket order and the closing index value.






The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the
AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors
by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market
indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected
in markets other than the Amex. The Exchange states that the specialist in such securities has no unique access to market
sensitive information regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange,
therefore, believes that specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in
the manner described above does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for
an execution at the closing price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the
close of the AHT session at 5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours
session.) A customer, therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price
suits its needs, and may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives.

III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with Sections 6(b)(5)
and 11 of the Act.
 The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of
an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The Commission also believes
that the proposal is consistent with Section 11(b) of the Act and Rule 11b-1 thereunder,
 which allow exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets.





Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity,
and continuity in the Exchange's market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the market, the Act, as well
as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon specialists.
 Primary among these obligations is the requirement to maintain fair and orderly markets by engaging in, among other
things, dealings for their own account to minimize the effects of temporary disparity between supply and demand.
 





The Commission believes that the rule change permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities listed
pursuant to Section 118B to participate in the AHT facility by entering an order for the specialist's account only
to eliminate order imbalances should assist specialists in their obligation to minimize temporary disparity between
supply and demand. In addition, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment
trust securities to participate in the AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing
price coupled orders would benefit investors by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative
securities based upon well known market indexes.
The Commission also believes that the Amex's rule change strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need
to accommodate the needs of investors by increasing liquidity in the listed cash market for derivative securities
based on market indexes, and the need to prevent the potential for manipulation or misuse of information. For example,
although Amex specialists will know which limit order are eligible for execution in the AHT facility, they will not
be able to use this information to their own advantage because Rule 1302(b) is being amended to eliminate the migration
of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility.
In addition, the Commission believes that approval of the Amex rule change for a one year pilot period will provide
the Commission and Exchange an opportunity to monitor the operation of the amendments to Rules 1300 and 1302. This
one year period also will allow the Commission and the Exchange the opportunity to monitor specialist compliance
with the amended rules to ensure that specialists are properly executing their responsibilities. 
Finally, in its rule filing, the Amex indicated that, during the one year pilot period, the Exchange would study the
operation of the facility to determine if there are any additional issues that need to be addressed. In this regard,
the Commission requests that the Exchange submit a report and analysis, by May 1, 1995, of the following information
(broken down by month): (1) trading volume (trades and number of shares of PDRs and investment trust securities) in
the after-hours session; (2) the number of trades, if any, of (a) single-sided orders, and (b) coupled buy and sell
orders which specialists executed in the after-hours session; (3) the number of shares, if any, of (a) single-sided
orders, and (b) coupled buy and sell orders which specialists executed in the after-hours session; and (4) the number,
if any, of single-sided orders that remained unexecuted at the end of the after-hours session. In addition, the Commission
expects the Amex, through use of its surveillance procedures, to monitor closely the trading of PDRs and investment
trust securities in the AHT facility to ensure that trading in these issues is not subject to any patterns of manipulation
or trading abuses or unusual trading activity. Finally, the Commission requests that the Amex keep the Commission
apprised of any technical problems which may arise regarding the operation of the pilot program.
It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-93-15) is hereby approved for a one year period until August
29, 1995.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to a Pilot Program
for Enhanced Specialist Participation in Parity Equity Options Trades</DOCTITLE>



August 26, 1994.



On February 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to enhanced specialist participation in parity equity options trades. Notice of
the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 28, 1994.
 One comment letter was received opposing the proposed rule change.
 The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on April 29, 1994,
 and Amendment No. 2 on August 25, 1994.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.










Description of Proposal



Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority
and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when
it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity,
and as such shall be shared equally. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all
currently listed ones are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review
by the Exchange.

The Exchange proposes to adopt, on a one year pilot basis, a proposed rule change providing that in certain circumstances
and for certain options classes, a specialist will be eligible to receive an enhanced participation on parity equity
options trades by being counted as two crowd participants (``Enhanced Parity Split''). The Enhanced Parity Split
will only apply to transactions where the contra side order is for more than five contracts, and where the Enhanced
Parity Split does not disadvantage a customer order that is also on parity.






The Enhanced Parity Split will apply to all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for
50% of each specialist unit's listed issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's
registered issues will be divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The
specialist will be able to choose half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen
does not exceed 50% of the total number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this
list to the Allocation, Evaluation and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This
list, once submitted to and approved by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot
program.


The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance
with respect to the Enhanced Parity Split. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the ``Quality of
Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance on a quarterly
basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of the Enhanced Parity
Split in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market maker in the trading crowd
as measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') in that
issue over the review period.

<TEXT>
 

Secondly, the Subcommittee will review whether the specialist has provided the Phlx with adequate market share in
options which are multiply traded. In this respect, the Subcommittee will determine whether the Phlx has transacted
at least 10% of the aggregate customer volume in an issue that is traded by all five options exchanges, at least 15% where
four exchanges trade the issue, at least 20% where three exchanges trade the issue, and at least 25% where only one other
exchange trades the issue. Although this is a measure of the total customer volume executed on the Exchange rather
than solely by the specialist, in the competition for multiply traded issues, the Exchange believes the specialist
is a key party responsible for marketing the issue to upstairs firms, updating markets, and maintaining the limit
order book. A specialist who performs these functions will, the Exchange believes, assist the Exchange in increasing
order flow.
Third, options specialist units must receive a score of at least five on the Exchange's quarterly specialist evaluation.
Rule 515 currently requires specialists to obtain this score for its activities regarding the options classes assigned
to the specialist unit. A specialist who receives a score below five on the quarterly evaluation is monitored by the
Exchange for continued substandard performance and may ultimately have one or more options classes removed and reallocated
to another specialist. For purposes of the Enhanced Parity Split, the failure by a specialist to achieve a score of
at least five on this quarterly review will cause the Enhanced Parity Split to be revoked even if the Exchange determines
not to strip a specialist of assigned options classes.
Fourth, the Subcommittee will consider whether a pattern of weakness has been demonstrated by such things as frequent
floor official rulings with respect to any particular options class or crowd and/or by written customer complaints
being received by the Exchange or Subcommittee regarding the specialist in any particular options class.





If the Subcommittee determines that a specialist has failed to meet one or more of these four conditions for any issue
eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split, the Subcommittee must make a preliminary finding that the specialist should
lose the Enhanced Parity Split in that issue. The specialist will be notified of this finding and will be required to
appear before the Subcommittee within five business days after receipt by the specialist of the notice.
 At such meeting, the specialist bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of substandard performance.






Any decision of the Subcommittee must be in writing and must be delivered to the specialist on the next business day
following the Subcommittee meeting at which the decision was made. A decision to revoke the privilege will be effective
on the next business day after receipt of the decision by the specialist. A specialist who has lost the privilege may
reapply for it at the Subcommittee's next scheduled review. The specialist may be reinstated if the Subcommittee
finds that the condition which initially caused the revocation of the enhanced participation privilege has been
cured and that no other problems exist. Finally, a specialist will be entitled to appeal any decisions made by the Subcommittee
pursuant to Rule 509.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is necessary because the Exchange has identified the need to attract
new specialist units and to retain and encourage existing specialists units to vigorously trade existing options
classes as well as to aggressively seek and apply for newly allocated classes. The Phlx understands that for the most
part, specialist units can seek specialist privileges or the equivalent lead market maker status for any particular
multiply listed options class on other national securities exchanges. Therefore, in order to compete for specialist
capital and market making talent with other national securities exchanges which list options, the Phlx believes
it is necessary to be able to afford its specialist units with some form of enhanced parity split treatment. Specifically,
in order to address these factors, the Exchange has determined to implement this one-year pilot program to increase
the specialist's participation in certain trades where the specialist is on parity with one or more ROTs.

The Exchange represents that while ROTs provide critical liquidity to the market making process at the Phlx, under
the Phlx's specialist system, the role of the specialist is to provide leadership, liquidity, and continuity, and
to satisfy market making obligations in multiply listed options classes, particularly at the incipiency of competition
for a multiply traded issue. For the options classes that will be eligible for multiple listing, the Exchange represents
that specialists have also taken on a larger market making obligation in order to accommodate customers in the hope
of garnering critical loyalty that will lead to sustained order flow whether the class is or is not ever actually multiply
traded.

As a point of clarification, the Exchange states that this proposed rule change will operate in tandem with the enhanced
specialist participation provided for new specialist units pursuant to Phlx Rule 1014, Commentary .17.
 Upon approval of the proposed rule change, a specialist will only be eligible to receive the Enhanced Parity Split
described herein once the specialist is no longer eligible for the enhanced treatment available pursuant to Commentary
.17 to Rule 1014.







Comment Letter



The comment letter received opposing the proposed rule change offered two arguments as to why the proposed rule change
is inappropriate.
 The commenter first argues that the proposed rule is anti-competitive and will ultimately harm public customers
by acting as a disincentive for ROTs to make competitive markets. Secondly, the commenter argues that a floor official
will be unable to determine whether a customer order is ``disadvantaged'' as prohibited by the rule. He further argues
that tracking which options are entitled to the Enhanced Parity Split and which are not will be a difficult chore and
that the need for elaborate review machinery to assure compliance with the proposed rule change is evidence that the
rule is unmanageable.





Phlx Response



Because this commenter raises the same objections that were raised in connection with the Phlx proposal approved
in the New Unit Enhanced Split Order,
 the Phlx relies on its previous response letter in order to address the objections raised in the Comment Letter.
 In response to the commenter's claims that the rule will work to the detriment of the trading public, the Phlx believes
that the proposal will in fact add liquidity to the market, thus directly benefitting public customers. The Phlx believes
the proposal will attract new specialists to the Exchange and will encourage new and existing specialists to make
tight markets in their selected options classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Phlx argues that
because every newly listed options class is subject to multiple listing, disincentives are created which discourage
specialists from acting as specialists for those new classes of options. The Phlx believes that the Enhanced Parity
Split will counteract these disincentives by offering specialists a direct benefit if they are able to attract order
flow to the Exchange. The Exchange further believes the specialists will be able to attract this order flow, and thus
capitalize on the Enhanced Parity Split, only if they maintain tight markets in their selected options classes. Furthermore,
the proposed rule change provides that the Enhanced Parity Split may not disadvantage an order submitted by a public
customer.
 As a result, the Phlx believes that public customers will directly benefit from the proposed rule change.







In response to the commenter's claims that market makers are unfairly disadvantaged by this proposal, the Phlx makes
several arguments. First, the Phlx disagrees with the commenter's contention that any enhanced split is anti-competitive
because a ROT can always establish priority in a trade by improving the market or by being the first in establishing
a market that would otherwise be on parity. Secondly, the Phlx argues that specialists have responsibilities and
are subject to certain costs that market makers do not have, such as, updating and disseminating quotes, reflecting
all market interest in the displayed quotes, and the fixed staffing cost committed to market making in a particular
issue whether it is active or not. In order to attract specialist units to the Exchange who are willing to accept these
responsibilities, the Phlx believes it is necessary to provide specialists with some benefits that are not available
to ROTs. The Phlx believes that any negative impact to ROTs that may be caused by this proposal is more than offset by
the benefit to the Exchange and its customers of attracting new specialist units to the Exchange and retaining the
services of existing specialist units.

Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5)
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the proposal may serve to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by encouraging
specialist units to maintain tight markets in selected options classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange.
The Commission believes the proposed rule change is a reasonable attempt by the Phlx to enhance the ability of specialist
units to compete for order flow in the environment of multiply-traded options classes. In addition, the protection
of investors and the public interest is maintained because of the procedures being adopted by the Exchange which require
the specialist units to satisfy specific conditions to qualify for the Enhanced Parity Split. Further, the proposed
rule change provides that the Enhanced Parity Split cannot disadvantage a public customer order that is on parity
with a specialist unit.







As the Commission stated in the new Unit Enhanced Split Order, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that in order
to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Phlx needs to be able to attract and retain well capitalized specialist units
that are willing to trade the options classes traded on the Exchange. Additionally, the Commission disagrees with
the commenter that the proposed rule change will disadvantage public customers. On the contrary, the proposed rule
change eliminates any direct injury to public customers by providing that customers orders on parity may not receive
a smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including the specialist. Furthermore, because the proposal
may serve to add liquidity to the market by encouraging specialist units to maintain tight markets in order to attract
order flow to the Exchange, the Commission believes that public customers could benefit from the proposed rule change.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the proposed rule change will
disadvantage public customers.





The Commission also acknowledges that specialist have responsibilities that ROTs do not have and that these responsibilities
have certain costs associated with them, such as the staff costs associated with continually updating and disseminating
quotes. As a result, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to grant certain advantages, such as
the Enhanced Parity Split, to specialists in order to attract and retain well capitalized specialists at the Exchange.
Accordingly, as long as these advantages do no unreasonably restrain competition and do not harm investors, the Commission
believes that the granting of such benefits to specialists is within the business judgment of the Exchange. Therefore,
even though the proposed rule change could arguably have some negative impact on ROTs, for the reasons stated above,
the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act.

Furthermore, the Commission believes that: (1) the review procedures proposed by the Exchange, as discussed above,
adequately ensure that only specialists satisfying the conditions set forth in the proposed rule change receive
the benefit of the Enhanced Parity Split; and (2) in cases where a specialist is found to no longer be eligible for the
Enhanced Parity Split, the appeals procedures proposed by the Exchange adequately protect the due process rights
of such specialists. The Commission believes that these criteria balance the competing interests of the Exchange
and the specialists by ensuring regular review of specialist performance and that specialists' due process rights
are protected in cases where the Subcommittee makes a determination that the Enhanced Specialist Split should be
denied.

Moreover, the proposal is being approved on a one-year pilot basis. Accordingly, prior to granting an extension or
permanent approval of the pilot program, the Commission will be able to review the operation of the rule and require
the Exchange to make any changes necessary to ensure that competition is not being unnecessarily restrained and that
investors are not being harmed.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 strengthens the proposal in several ways. By requiring
specialists to meet with the Subcommittee within five days after receipt of a notice from the Subcommittee, the specialist
is provided with time in which to prepare a response to the claims of substandard performance raised by the Subcommittee.
Similarly, by clarifying that all determinations made pursuant to Rule 509 are appealable pursuant to the procedures
in the Exchange's by-laws, the Commission believes that the proposal does not raise any significant due process concerns.

Furthermore, even though Amendment No. 1 does not specifically define ``pattern of weakness'' for purposes of Rule
509(b)(4), the Commission does not believe that this lack of specificity will create undo confusion as the application
of the rule. Any specialist that is cited for substandard performance for this reason will still be entitled to a meeting
with the Subcommittee to discuss the reasons for the finding and if an adverse decision is sustained after that meeting,
the specialist will be entitled to appeal that determination. Additionally, a specialist can reapply and have the
Enhanced Parity Split reinstated once the condition which led to the suspension is found to no longer exist. As a result,
the Commission believes that the lack of specificity does not raise any significant regulatory concerns. 
Finally, Amendment No. 2 merely codifies that intent stated in the original proposal
 that specialists will only become eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split described herein once they are no longer
eligible to receive the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialists pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule
1014. 




Based on the foregoing reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve
Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Phlx's proposal on an accelerated basis.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the
proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-12 and should be submitted by September 23, 1994.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-94-12) is hereby approved, as amended, on a pilot basis until
August 26, 1995.

Entergy Corporation (70-8445)


Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, a registered holding company,
has filed an application-declaration with the Commission under Sections 3(b), 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 32 and 33
of the Act and Rules 10, 43, 45, 53, and 54.
Entergy seeks exemptions from the Act in connection with the acquisition of the securities of one or more subsidiary
companies (collectively, ``Subsidiary Companies'') which will be engaged directly or indirectly, and exclusively,
in the business of owning and holding the securities of a new Argentine company (``Newco''). Newco will be formed to
bid for the right to build, own and operate proposed high voltage transmission line (``Project'') in northeast Argentina.
Entergy states that Newco would qualify as a ``foreign utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. Therefore, Entergy
requests that the Commission issue an order under Section 3(b) exempting the certain Subsidiary Companies from all
provisions of the Act that would be applicable to such companies as ``subsidiary companies'' of Entergy. In the Alternative,
Entergy proposes to acquire the securities of the Subsidiary Companies under all other applicable sections and rules
thereunder of the Act.
The Project is designed to carry electricity from the Yacyreta hydroelectric facility, now under construction,
to the high voltage transmission system owned and operated by Transener S.A. Entergy Currently owns an indirect 9.8%
interest in Transener S.A. through its wholly owned subsidiary company, Entergy Transener S.A., which is also a ``foreign
utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. The Project is expected to take up to 22 months to complete at a total cost
of up to approximately U.S. $300 million. Entergy will be participating in the Project with a consortium of other U.S.
and international investors (``Consortium'').
Entergy contends that for various tax and legal reasons, it is preferable to hold its interest in Newco indirectly
through the Subsidiary Companies. Entergy further asserts that the particular ownership structure to be used for
the Project will depend on, among other things, the requirements of the documents relating to the bidding for the Project
(``Bid Documents''). The Bid Documents currently require that the shareholders of Newco, collectively, have an
aggregate net worth of at least $150 million. The terms of the Bid Documents further provide that, during the construction
period for the Project, each shareholder of Newco is jointly and severally liable together with Newco for all obligations
arising out of construction, including damages. In view of such requirements, as well as the possible requirements
of Project lenders, Entergy proposes that it may fully or partially capitalize one or more of the Subsidiary Companies
(but not newco) with amounts up to its proportionate share of the Project's estimated total cost either prior to the
submission of the Cosortium's bid or to facilitate the financial closing of the Project. Entergy expects that its
total investment in connection with the Project, including any contingent liabilities of a Subsidiary Company as
a shareholder of Newco, would in no event exceed $90 million. 
Entergy proposes that within 45 days after a determination is made not to proceed with an acquisition of an interest
in the Project, it will liquidate or dissolve the Subsidiary Companies, unless Entergy determines to utilize the
Subsidiary Companies in conjunction with another exempt acquisition under Sections 32 or 33 of the Act. Therefore,
Entergy requests authorization from the Commission to effect such a liquidation or dissolution.
The direct or indirect investments in the Subsidiary Companies may take the form of: (1) purchases of capital stock,
partnership interests, notes or other securities; (2) capital contributions or open account advances; (3) guarantees,
letters of credit or other credit support (collectively, Guarantees'') arranged or provided by Entergy in respect
of the securities or other obligations of a Subsidiary Company or Newco in connection with the Project; or (4) any combination
of the above. Investments by Entergy in the capital shares or other equity securities of Subsidiary Companies having
a stated or par value will be in an amount not less than such stated or par value. Open account advances by Entergy to a
Subsidiary Company would be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the advance. Any promissory notes
or other evidences of indebtedness issued by a Subsidiary Company to Entergy would: (1) mature not late than 30 years
after the date of issuance thereof; and (2) bear interest at a rate not greater than the prime rate of a bank to be designated
by Entergy. Any such promissory note or other evidences of indebtedness may, at Entergy's option, be converted to
a capital contribution through Entergy's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby.
Entergy requests authority through December 31, 1997 to issue Guarantees in an aggregate amount that, when added
to investments in the Subsidiary Companies and Newco otherwise made as provided above, will not exceed $90 million.
Guarantees may be required, among other things, to satisfy credit support requirements of lenders and other Project
participants under financing documents or other agreements to which the Subsidiary Companies or Newco becomes a
party in connection with the development of the Project. The terms of, and any fees or interest payable in respect of,

Transfer of Interstate Maintenance Program Funds 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed final policy statement; requests for comments. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed final policy statement sets forth the FHWA's policy for addressing the interstate maintenance program
funds transfer provisions of 23 U.S.C. 119(f)(1). The criteria for determining what constitutes adequate maintenance,
which are included in this policy, are associated with only the transfer of Interstate Maintenance (IM) funds and
are not related to the State's responsibility to properly maintain projects constructed with Federal-aid funds
outlined in 23 U.S.C. 116, Maintenance.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 3, 1993, the FHWA published an interim policy statement on the transfer of Interstate maintenance program
funds at 58 FR 12299, and provided a 60-day public comment period which closed on May 3, 1993. During the intervening
period, FHWA has evaluated the comments and reconsidered its initial position. As a result, the FHWA is proposing
to modify the pavement roughness and faulting criteria and to add additional criteria that were not proposed in the
interim policy. 

A total of 18 State highway agencies (SHAs) and the Highway User Federation for Safety and Mobility (HUFSAM), a public
interest group, provided written comments to the docket established for the interim policy statement. 

The SHA comments ranged from administrative type questions, such as requests for clarification of measurement procedures
and use of existing pavement management system data, to fundamental positions on the individual indicators and the
specific established criteria. Some SHAs endorsed various portions of the criteria established, while others took
exception to part or all of the criteria. 

The HUFSAM strongly endorsed the interim policy. It stressed the need to assure that the Interstate System be maintained
at a very high level and noted that, from its studies, nationwide, the Interstate maintenance funding levels are inadequate.


After evaluating the comments received, the FHWA continues to believe that transfers of apportioned IM funds specifically
earmarked for Interstate maintenance to other designated programs should be permitted only when the Interstate
System routes are in a physical, operational, and safe condition and perform at or near the level for which they were
designed, and constructed. Because pavement and bridge activities constitute the major cost items of IM eligible
activities, the interim policy focused on pavement and bridge condition indicators as the determining factors for
eligibility to transfer IM funds. Other essential elements, necessary to maintain the physical and operational
integrity of the Interstate, must also be considered in transportation decisions. Responses to the interim policy,
however, indicate a concern that other essential elements need not be considered in transfer decisions. This was
not the intent of the interim policy statement. 

Section 101(a) of Title 23 U.S.C. defines ``maintenance'' to mean the preservation of the entire highway, including
surface, shoulders, roadside, structures, and such traffic control devices as are necessary for its safe and efficient
utilization. As the IM program now provides the major resources for rehabilitation, resurfacing, and restoration
(3R) work on the Interstate System, extending the service life of all major components and enhancing highway safety
on the system should receive first priority for IM fund use. For example, over 25 percent of the projects and approximately
10 percent of funds from the IM program are currently being expended on traffic and safety improvement projects. The
FHWA supports a continued strong emphasis on safety. 

In a sampling of SHA pavement management systems conducted during the past year, the FHWA found that the pavement condition
indicators established in the interim policy are generally collected and used by the States in evaluating the condition
of the Interstate for their own management purposes. While the data collection and reporting procedures differ somewhat,
the fundamental indicators are consistently used by the SHA's to manage their Interstate pavements. 

The proposed final policy includes the original pavement and bridge condition indicators established in the interim
policy and adds pavement surface friction as a fourth pavement condition indicator. However, the roughness criteria
has been modified and the separate faulting criteria for jointed plain and joint reinforced concrete pavement (JPCP
and JRCP) has been replaced with a single criterion of 525 mm/km (33 inches/mile) for both jointed pavement types.


In addition to these interim factors, this proposed final policy statement adds criteria for the additional traffic
and safety related indicators of (1) safety appurtenances, (2) traffic control devices, and (3) geometric elements.
These indicators are equally critical to the Interstate System which relies heavily on the availability of IM 
funds for continued adequacy. Maintenance of the Interstate System's operational as well as physical characteristics
in a satisfactory manner remains the first priority for the use of these funds. 



Comments Received 



This section addresses specific SHA comments organized around the criteria established for each of the individual
condition indicators.

Pavement Roughness 


Three SHAs suggested that the International Roughness Index (IRI), developed at the International Road Roughness
Experiment, is not the appropriate measure of rideability. The FHWA recognizes that IRI does have some limitations.
It does, however, provide a common quantitative basis with which to reference the different measures of roughness.
Further, it is currently collected by SHAs and provided to FHWA under the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)
submission requirements. Although the FHWA is open to use of improved pavement surface rideability measures, until
such time that improved measures and equipment to measure them are accepted and readily available to SHA's, the FHWA
will continue to rely on IRI as the ride indicator. 
Four SHAs commented that the specific IRI criteria of 240 cm/km (150 inches/mile) was too severe. The FHWA disagrees.
The selection of the 240 cm/km upper limit criteria on pavement roughness was directly tied to the FHWA's desire to
require Interstate pavement to be in fair or better condition. The interim policy noted that initial IRI to pavement
serviceability rating
 (PSR) conversion studies
 indicated a 240 cm/km IRI is equivalent to a PSR range of 3.0 to 3.5. Pavements within this range are classified as fair
in the FHWA's ``1992 Highway Statistics''
 report. Subsequent additional analysis of the IRI/PSR correlation indicates that a 240 cm/km IRI more accurately
reflects a much lower PSR range of 2.5 to 2.8 (pavements in this range are classified as being in poor to mediocre condition
). Based on this further analysis, the FHWA has established an upper limit of allowable IRI of 200 cm/km (127
'
'/mile). This converts to a PSR of between 2.8 and 3.2 which is more consistent with the FHWA's original objective
that pavements be in fair or better condition
. 








Rutting 


Rutting comments were limited to data collection difficulties and reflected a degree of uncertainty about what data
collection equipment and procedure would be considered acceptable. No comments were received concerning the appropriateness
of the rutting indicator or the established criteria. Therefore the FHWA has retained 15 mm (5/8 inch) as the upper
allowable limit of rutting. Concerns related to data collection equipment and procedures are addressed under ``Pavement
Data Collection,'' later in the preamble. 


Faulting 


The SHA comments on the faulting criteria were split evenly; five SHAs thought that the faulting criteria were too
restrictive, while five SHAs commented that the criteria were acceptable. In addition, the HUFSAM found the criteria
acceptable.

<DOCNO> FR940902-2-00160 </DOCNO>

One SHA recommended simplifying the policy by replacing the separate faulting criteria for jointed plain and jointed
reinforced concrete pavement (JPCP and JRCP) with a single faulting criterion in mm/km (inches/mile) for both pavement
types. A mm/km based criteria would eliminate the need to take joint frequency into account, as the average allowable
faulting per joint would be directly related to the number of joints/mile. The FHWA recognizes the merit in this recommendation
and has replaced the separate faulting criteria of 3 mm on JPCP and 6 mm on JRCP with an equivalent maximum faulting rate
of 525 mm/km (33 inches/mile) for both. This faulting rate is equivalent to 3 mm per joint on typical JPCP with 6 meter
(20 foot) joint spacing and 6 mm per joint on JRCP with 12 meter (40 foot) joint spacing. Because joint spacing varies
between States, the allowable faulting per joint will differ from State to State, even though the faulting rate per
km remains constant. 


Administrative_Procedural Tolerance Limits 


The most common comment, received from seven SHAs, was that the scope of the application of the criteria was too stringent.
The crux of the argument was that some tolerance limit should be established to allow a SHA in substantial compliance
to transfer funds. A common suggestion was that the FHWA only require that 90 to 95 percent of the Interstate System
meet the criteria before allowing transfer. 
The FHWA recognizes that there are continually evolving pavement and bridge needs and, at any one point in time, even
SHAs with exceptionally good pavements might not meet the criteria on 100 percent of their Interstate system. The
FHWA has already provided relief for this situation. The interim policy specifically allows transfer when all criteria
are not met on the Interstate if the work necessary to correct any deficient segments is included in the approved State
Transportation Improvement Program, required by 23 U.S.C. 135(f). This relief is included in the final policy. The
FHWA believes that allowing a 5 to 10 percent exemption or tolerance would be unwise, as it would allow transfer of money
necessary to maintain the Interstate highway system. 


Pavement Data Collection 


Several SHAs posed comments and questions on data collection and reporting procedures. The primary concern appeared
to be whether FHWA would require a specific data collection effort using some standardized equipment and procedures
that would be different from what is currently used by the individual SHAs. Further, the comments included request
for flexibility in summarizing the data. Several suggested that FHWA should use whatever SHA PMS data was available
to determine the acceptability of a certification accompanying a transfer request. 
The FHWA intends to rely primarily on current surface roughness, rutting, and faulting information contained in
SHAs PMS database(s) and from information reported in HPMS in evaluating the pavement component of State certifications
accompanying Interstate maintenance fund transfer requests. 
The FHWA recognizes the uniqueness of each SHA's PMS and the diversity of equipment and procedures used by the SHAs
to meet their particular pavement management needs. The FHWA is not prescribing new specific uniform data collection
equipment, procedures, sampling, or data reduction techniques to determine compliance with the pavement Interstate
maintenance transfer criteria. 


Bridges 


Only two SHA's commented on the bridge section of the policy. Both endorsed the use of the current National Bridge Inventory
(NBI) bridge deck condition rating (Item 58) as an indicator and supported the 
criteria requirement that bridge decks have a condition rating of 5 or better. This is consistent with the long standing
use of a deck rating of less than 5 to determine a structurally deficient bridge. 
Both States also recommended that FHWA include the NBI ratings for superstructure and substructure in the policy
and delete the load posting requirement contained in the interim policy. 
The FHWA originally considered using superstructure and substructure ratings as specific criteria when it initially
developed the interim policy. Upon further consideration, FHWA still supports ``load posting'' criterion which
reflects superstructure and substructure condition ratings and is also a measure of potential safety concern. 
The need for load posting is an end result of applying superstructure and substructure conditions, along with other
factors, in making load carrying capacity calculations. Changes in condition ratings, and therefore, the load posting,
are affected by a reduced maintenance effort which eventually leads to continual and long-term deterioration of
bridge elements. 
One of the SHAs further recommended that the FHWA incorporate failure susceptibility as an indicator. Failure susceptibility
is not required nor normally assessed by States in the course of inspecting bridges to meet national bridge inspection
standards. As a result, the FHWA believes it would be inappropriate to use failure susceptibility as a nationwide
criterion in the IM fund transfer policy, and has not included it. 
Finally, one SHA recommended that bridge railing adequacy should be included in the decision factors. The FHWA considered
including bridge railing adequacy as indicated by NBI Item 36 in the early development of policy criteria. The NBI
Item 36 is a four segment item that rates bridge railings for adequate impact strength, and approach guardrail for
adequate vehicle safety and protection. 
The adequacy of bridge railings and approach guardrail is a serious safety concern and should be considered in the
States' maintenance program as well as in developing highway safety projects. 


Bridge Data Collection 


The NBI ratings are determined in accordance with the ``Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and
Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges'' (Coding Guide) U.S. DOT/FHWA, December 1988. 


Policy 


For the purpose of 23 U.S.C. 119(f)(1), which provides for transfer of State apportioned IM funds that are in excess
of a State's need to the State's NHS and STP apportionment, the FHWA will accept a State's certification if the State's
Interstate routes meet the following criteria: 


Pavement: 


(1) An IRI of 200 cm per km (127 inches per mile) or less;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940902-2-00161 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940902-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Rutting of 15 mm (5/8 inch) or less on flexible pavements; 
(3) Cumulative faulting of 525 mm per km (33 inches/mile) or less on jointed rigid pavements; and 
(4) Surfaces have adequate surface friction and drainage, based on the State accidents record system not identifying
any locations with a high incidence of wet weather accidents. 


Bridges: 


(1) Bridge decks in ``fair condition'' or better (Coding Guide item 58 rated 5 or better); and 
(2) No load posting required (Coding Guide item 70 rated 5). 


Safety Appurtenances: 


Guardrail, bridge rails, safety barriers, and other safety features including the upstream ends of all traffic barriers
meet (a) the performance criteria of 23 CFR 625, (b) acceptable use warrants, and (c) installation requirements per
State standard plans. 


Traffic Control Devices: 


All major guide, regulatory, and warning signs meet the minimum size, shape, color, format, and message requirements
as well as the day and night legibility and visibility requirements of the MUTCD and amendments. 


Geometric Elements: 


(1) The horizontal and vertical alignment, and widths of median, traveled way, and shoulders meet the AASHTO Interstate
Standards, as incorporated in 23 CFR 625, in effect either at the time of original construction, major reconstruction,
or inclusion into the Interstate system, which ever was the latest; and 
(2) Hazardous features (fixed objects, steep sideslopes, etc.) within the clear zone are either eliminated, corrected,
or adequately shielded. 



In the event that the condition, as reflected by current databases, does not meet the required criteria, for any segment
of Interstate, the State's request for funding transfer may not be approved unless the State certifies that the deficient
segments have either been subsequently upgraded to meet the required criteria or that the work necessary to correct
any such deficient segments is included in the approved State Transportation Improvement Program, required by 23
U.S.C. 135(f). 
Section 119(f)(2) of Title 23, U.S.C., allows the States to transfer up to 20 percent of the apportioned IM funds to
the NHS and STP apportionment based solely on the request of the States.

200,000 crashes in which these vehicles are involved each year. To date, the application of these technologies to
commercial vehicles has been limited to single unit trucks and truck tractors because of constraints inherent in
the present combination-unit truck trailer electrical powering and signalling communication system.

Traditionally, the U.S. trucking industry equipment needs have been supplied by the truck/tractor manufacturer
(supplying the towing unit) and the trailer manufacturer (supplying the cargo space to move goods). The two units
are married at the fifth wheel of the power unit and the king-pin of the trailer. Communication and powering between
the tractor and trailer consists of little more than supplying power and control from the tractor to the running lights
of the trailer through the standard seven pin electrical connector (seven circuits). One of the primary reasons for
lack of technology change in the standard seven circuit connection between the tractor and trailer is that any change
may result in lack of compatibility between tractors and trailers operating in the U.S. However, the defense, aerospace,
and computer industries have begun to focus on commercial vehicle applications as a potential new market for their
innovative ideas and advanced technologies to improve safety, efficiency and productivity. In order for these advances
to happen, they must comply with the needs and objectives of the users.

Vehicle/unit locators, vehicle/driver trip loggers, on-board weight measurement and recording systems, vehicle
maintenance status monitor/recorder/transmitters, administrative credentials transponders, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors, resulting in significant operational efficiency
benefits. Likewise, sideward-looking, reward-looking, and forward-looking collision avoidance systems, driver
performance monitors, antilock and electronic braking systems, brake maintenance status monitors, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors to enhance their operational safety performance.

To date, the application of these developing technologies to commercial vehicles has been limited predominately
to the power unit. There is clearly a need to overcome the inherent constraints presently found in the communicating
and powering system between tractors and trailers. These constraints are exacerbated in the case of multi-unit combination
tractor/trailers, the vehicle type which will likely have an increased future role in improving the productivity
of the motor carrier industry. The ability to install advanced technology IVHS productivity and safety enhancing
equipment on this type of vehicle may be a key element in making their expanded future use practical and acceptable.

A number of possibilities have been suggested this issue, including but not limited to: radio/telemetry communication
linkages among units in the combination, communications signal multiplexing, voltage enhancements, wiring system
upgrades, additional electrical circuits and/or wiring connector systems, etc. The successful introduction of
any or all of these approaches will hinge on whether they can be integrated, and be compatible with existing equipment
in the current commercial motor carrier fleet. A comparative evaluation of these approaches, and fleet demonstrations
of the most promising among these, will help foster the implementation of IVHS technology in this application.



Objective



To assess the functional capabilities and limitations, as well as the reliability and practicality, of alternative
means of providing power to and sending/receiving communication signals to/from multiple numbers and different
types of advanced technology safety and productivity enhancing systems on multi-unit combination heavy commercial
tractor/trailers. Assessments will be made with a view to fostering the ability of system suppliers and truck users
to commercially deploy these type systems.



Research Approach



NHTSA believes that a teaming approach may be necessary to conduct this research. One or more cooperative agreements
are envisioned in which a consortium of organizations with experience in truck/tractor manufacturing, trailer
manufacturing, electronic system and component development, wiring and connectors, vehicle test and evaluation,
and motor carrier operation (in the case of an in-service demonstration project) appear ideally suited to pursue
this program.

Because of the potential for cost sharing, the performing organization may retain the rights to any proprietary product
or technology developed under the agreement, subject to a government use license. The organization would be free
to pursue commercial development and marketing for the products. NHTSA will require deliverables, however, which
could include reports suitable for publishing in the public domain to document such items as the research methods
and system evaluation results. Certain proprietary information, such as algorithms, need not be released in the
public domain.

It is anticipated that one or more cooperative agreements may be awarded under this program. Projects will be funded
incrementally, with up to a three-year support period. The maximum funding level that is anticipated for the total
project is $575,000, excluding cost sharing provided by the performing organization(s). The maximum incremental
funding available in any one year is anticipated to be $300,000.



NHTSA Involvement



The NHTSA, Office of Crash Avoidance Research, will be involved in all activities undertaken as part of this cooperative
agreement program and will:

1. Provide, on an as-available basis, one professional staff person, to be designated as the Contracting Officer's
Technical Representative (COTR), to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreement, and
to coordinate activities between the organization and NHTSA;

2. Make available information and technical assistance from government sources, within available resources and
as determined appropriate by the COTR. This shall include data from state and national accident databases, human
factors data, or any other resources within the government that may be of use in supporting research efforts;

3. Provide liaison with other government agencies and organizations as appropriate; and 

4. Help expand the knowledge base of collision avoidance systems and enabling technologies by publishing nonproprietary
information developed at Government expense in the scientific literature, thus making it available to all organizations
involved in research and product development in this area.



Period of Support



The research and development effort described in this notice may be supported through the award of a cooperative agreement.
NHTSA reserves the right to make multiple cooperative agreement awards for the effort described in this notice depending
on the merits of the applications received and the amount of Federal funding available.
