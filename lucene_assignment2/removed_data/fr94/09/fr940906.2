Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are advising the public that four environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).



In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' 
review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the field tests.

Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms:






The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

<DOCTITLE>Supplement to Final Environmental Impact Statement for East Curlew Creek Area Timber Sales, Colville National Forest,
Ferry County, WA</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a supplement to final environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare a Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for East Curlew
Creek Area Timber Sales. The final EIS and Record of Decision were released in March 1994 (Notice of Availability date
is March 25, 1994, 59 FR 14162). After a lighting storm in July 1994, a fire began in the Copper Butte area. This fire burned
over 133 acres of prepared timber sale harvest units in the East Curlew Creek Area timber sales while damaging or killing
timber within a 10,670 acre area. The area damaged by fire is partially within and adjacent to the original analysis
area. This significant new circumstance has dictated substantial changes that must be reanalyzed as a supplement
to the existing analysis.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The original decision was to have two timber sales_Alec Timber Sale and Santim Timber Sale. The Alec Timber sale was
to harvest 3.8 million board feet (MMBF) of timber from approximately 771 acres without any road construction. The
Santim Timber Sale was to harvest 4.2 MMBF of timber from approximately 754 acres while constructing 2.3 miles of road.
The original analysis area was approximately 29,600 acres and included a portion of the Profanity Roadless Area which
was considered, but not selected for Wilderness designation.



On May 27, 1994, the Regional Forester signed a Decision Notice for the Continuation of the Interim Management Direction
Establishing Riparian, Ecosystem and Wildlife Standards for Timber Sales (also known as screening direction).
These Interim Direction changes were made to the East Curlew Area Timber Sales Record of Decision to conform to this
Interim Direction.
The July fire and Regional Interim Direction have resulted in new circumstances and substantial changes to the original
decision for East Curlew Creek Area Timber Sales. The proposed action begin considered in this Supplement is as follows:
(1) A Copper Salvage Sale, which would harvest approximately 5.0 MMBF from 750 acres with no road construction, (2)
Santim Timber Sale, which would harvest approximately 2.6 MMBF from 346 acres with no road construction; and (3) no
change in the Alec timber sale. No road construction is planned within the Profanity Roadless Area. The draft Supplement
will be tiered to the final EIS for the Colville National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (December, 1988).
The Supplement will be prepared, circulated and filed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping), as a draft and final
environmental statement (40 CFR 1502.9). The draft Supplement is expected to be filed in January 1995 and available
for public comment and review.
The comment period on the draft Supplement to the final EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register.
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of a draft Supplement to final EIS
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 533 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft Supplement stage but that
are not raised until after completion of the final Supplement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d. 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
Supplement to the final EIS.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft Supplement to the final EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific
pages or chapters of the draft Supplement, comments may also address the adequacy of the draft Supplement to the final
EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewer may wish to refer to the
Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environment
Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.)
After the 45 day comment period ends on the draft Supplement to the final EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered
by the Forest Service in preparing the final Supplement to the final EIS. The final Supplement is scheduled to be completed
by March 1995. In the final Supplement to the Final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments received
(40 CFR 1503.4). Edward L. Schultz, Forest Supervisor, Responsible Official will consider the comments, responses,
environmental consequences discussed in the Supplement to the EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies
in making a decision regarding this proposal. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons for
the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to review under 36 CFR 215.

Potassium Permanganate From the People's Republic of China; Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On July 7, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Carus Chemical Company (Carus),
the petitioner, that it be permitted to withdraw its request for an administrative review, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5)
(1994), of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the
period January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. Although the Department received the request to withdraw after
the normal period allowed, the Department is terminating this administrative review in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), the Department may extend the normal 90-day time limit for withdrawal of a
request for review if the Department determines it is reasonable to do so. We have determined that it is reasonable
to extend the time limit for Carus' request because we have not issued preliminary results of review for this period
and because there is no indication on the record that the substantive rights of any party would be impaired by such a
decision.


Respondent Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi) has objected to the termination request on the grounds that (1) the Department
should not ignore the information Zunyi has already placed on the record for this review, and (2) the request for a 1992
review was a factor in respondent's decision not to challenge the results of the 1990 review, published on May 23, 1994
(59 FR 26625).
It is our position that Zunyi should have been aware, in making its decision with regard to the 1990 review, that the
1992 review was based solely on the petitioner's request, which could possibly be withdrawn pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).
Furthermore, neither the statute nor the regulations prohibit the termination of a review in which responses have
been received. Zunyi could have, in either case, guaranteed its right to continue this review, by making its own request
for review at the proper time. By not making such a request, Zunyi has forfeited its legal ability to compel the Department
to continue a review in which the only party still requesting review has now withdrawn that request. Accordingly,
it is appropriate to terminate this review.
This notice is published in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675) and 19
CFR 353.22(a)(5).

Respondent Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi) and Novachem have objected to the termination request on the grounds that
(1) the Department should not ignore the information Zunyi has already placed on the record for this review, and (2)
the request for a 1991 review was a factor in respondent's decision not to challenge the results of the 1990 review,
published on May 23, 1994 (59 FR 26625).

It is our position that Zunyi should have been aware, in making its decision with regard to the 1990 review, that the
1991 review was presently based solely on the petitioner's request, which could possibly be withdrawn pursuant to
section 19 CFR  353.22(a)(5). Furthermore, neither the statute nor the regulations prohibit the termination

Approval of Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 188, Standard Security Label for Information
Transfer


<AGENCY>
agency: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved a new standard, which will be published
as FIPS Publication 188, Standard Security Label for Information Transfer.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

On August 21, 1992 and January 28, 1994, notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 37948 and 59 FR 4031, respectively) that a Federal Information Processing Standard for Standard Security Label
for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile was being proposed for Federal use.


The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this standard were reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve the standard
as a Federal Information Processing Standards Publication, and prepared a detailed justification document for
the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.
The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available
for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert
C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues NW., Washington, DC 20230.
This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.

Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 188


(date)


Announcing A
Standard Security Label for Information Transfer


Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.


Name of Standard:

 Standard Security Label for Information Transfer.


Category of Standard:! Computer Security, Security Labels.
Explanation:

 Security labels convey information used by protocol entities to determine how to handle data communicated between
open systems. Information on a security label can be used to control access, specify protective measures, and determine
additional handling restrictions required by a communications security policy.
This standard defines a security label syntax for information exchanged over data networks and provides label encodings
for use at the Application and Network Layers. The syntactic constructs defined in this standard are intended to be
used along with semantics provided by the authority establishing the security policy for the protection of the information
exchanged. A separate NIST document, referenced in an informative appendix, defines a Computer Security Objects
Register (CSOR) that serves as repository for label semantics. The CSOR assigns a unique identifier to each set of
interpretation and handling rules. This enables the communicating parties to agree on the semantics for the interpretation
of the labels. The separation of the label syntax from its semantics enables a few basic label structures to support
multiple security policies.
The label presented here defines security tags that may be combined into tag sets to carry security-related information.
Five basic security tag types allow security information to be represented as bit maps, attribute enumerations,
attribute range selections, hierarchical security levels, or as user-defined data. Because of inherent differences
in layer functionality, the security label defined in this document is expressed both as an abstract label syntax
specification for the OSI Application Layer and an encoding optimized for use at the Network Layer.


Approving Authority:

 Secretary of Commerce.


Maintenance Agency:

 Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology.


Cross Index:
Federal Information Resources Management Regulations, subpart 201-20.303, Standards, and subpart 201-39.1002,
Federal Standards.
General Procedures for Registering Computer Security Objects, NISTIR 5308, December 1993.
Security Labels for Open Systems_An Invitational Workshop, NISTIR 4362, June 1990.
Standard Security Label for GOSIP_An Invitational Workshop, NISTIR 4614, June 1991.
Scope:

 This standard defines syntactic constructs for conveying security label information when Government sensitive
but unclassified data is exchanged over computer networks. The syntactic constructs defined in this standard are
intended to be used along with semantics provided by the authority establishing security policy for the protection
of the information exchanged. NIST has established a Computer Security Objects Register (CSOR) that will serve as
repository for label semantics. Informative Appendix A of this standard provides further details on the CSOR.
This standard does not discuss the physical labeling of information or storage media and information displayed on
a computer screen or other peripherals. Labeling of information stored in internal memory and storage media (e.g.
hard disks, compact disks, magnetic tapes, etc.) is also outside of the scope of this standard. The protection of data
in transit and their associated labels along with the binding between the data and the labels is the responsibility
of the communications protocols involved in the transfer and therefore not discussed here. Compliance with this
standard does not provide assurance of the suitability of an implementation for the protection of data according
to specific security policies. That assessment must be made through the appropriate evaluation and certification
processes.


Applicability:

 This standard applies to U.S. Government communications systems required by agency security policy to label sensitive
but unclassified data when exchanged over data networks. Although this standard is intended for use on systems handling
unclassified information, it could be adopted by the appropriate authorities for use on systems handling classified
information.
Complying implementations shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, and obtaining information from security
labels based on the specifications in this document.


Specifications:

 Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 188) Standard Security Label for Information Transfer (affixed).


Implementation Schedule:

 This standard becomes effective 1 March 1995.

Waiver Procedure:

 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waiver shall be granted only when:
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or
b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide
savings.
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any accompanying documents,
with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under United States Code Section 552(b), shall
be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.


Where to Obtain Copies:

 Copies of this publication are for sale by the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Springfield, VA 22161. When ordering, refer to Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 188 (FIPSPUB
188), and identify the title. When microfiche is desired, this should be specified. Prices are published by NTIS in

<DOCTITLE>Albuquerque Operations Office; Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the State of Texas</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), gives
notice of its plans for award of a cooperative agreement to the State of Texas, on a noncompetitive basis, in support
of the establishment and management of a National Resource Center for Plutonium (the Center) to be located in the Amarillo,
Texas area. The Center is envisioned to be the source for primarily plutonium-related information for the public
and especially for the State of Texas. The Center will support the collection, review and interpretation of technical
literature, sponsoring and coordinating additional studies and research, engaging in the study of the environmental
effects of plutonium, high explosives and other nuclear or hazardous materials generated from nuclear weapons dismantlement,
and characterization of local environmental transport and accumulation of plutonium, and public outreach. It will
not engage in physical, chemical, or metallurgical studies of plutonium.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of Energy has determined that restriction to the State of Texas is appropriate based on the following
information:



The participant, the State of Texas, is the unit of government having the direct responsibility and appropriate jurisdiction
to protect the welfare, health and safety of its citizens. No other entity, other than the Federal Government, has
the direct responsibility to protect the environment and the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the State
of Texas. Therefore, DOE in the public interest will make a noncompetitive financial assistance award to the State
of Texas. Further, due to the fact that (1) Texas has the primary and direct responsibility for the health, welfare,
and safety of its citizens, and (2) the Pantex Plant, is conducting nuclear weapons dismantlement, which is an activity
within Texas' jurisdiction, DOE is therefore precluded from providing support to another entity. This award will
be in the best interests of the Government and the public and is considered vital and timely with respect to the continuing
mission of nuclear weapons dismantlement at Pantex.

Accordingly, based upon the above, the award of a cooperative agreement to the State of Texas, on a noncompetitive
basis, appropriately satisfies the criteria specified in Paragraphs (C) and (H) of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i). DOE has
determined that: (1) The applicant is a unit of government and the activity supported is related to performance of
a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction; and, (2) such award is in the public interest. 

This initiative was contained in the President's FY 95 amended Congressional budget request and will be supported
by Surplus Fissile Materials Control and Disposition funds. The cooperative agreement will be awarded for an initial
period of five (5) years. At maturity, the total annual budget is estimated to be approximately $10 million for the
Center. The cooperative agreement will be administered by the Albuquerque Operations Office. This agreement will
not become effective for at least 14 days after publication of this notice to allow for public comment.

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 315(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2286d(b) requires the Department of Energy to
publish its response to Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board recommendations for notice and public comment. The
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board published Recommendation 94-1, concerning an improved schedule
for remediation in the defense nuclear facilities complex, in the 

Federal Register

 on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28848).


</SUMMARY>
<SIGNER>
James M. Ahlgrimm,

</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Acting Departmental Representative to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.



The Honorable John T. Conway
Chairman


Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, 625 Indiana Avenue, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20004.



Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter responds to your Recommendation 91-1, Improved Schedule for Remediation in
the Defense Nuclear Complex, of May 26, 1994. The Department shares the concerns outlined in your letter, and we agree
that there is a need to take timely action to place the substances formerly used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons
into a state suitable for safe interim storage. There are significant activities underway, such as the Plutonium
Vulnerability Study and the associated Management Plan to address many of the hazards cited in your Recommendation.
Your Recommendation calls for an integrated program plan to be formulated on a high priority basis to convert, within
two to three years, the specific materials cited in the Recommendation to forms or conditions suitable for safe interim
storage. The Department commits to develop a plan that will include the following initiatives:



a systems engineering approach to maximize the integration of facilities and capabilities while minimizing worker
exposures and additional waste;
research programs required to fill any gaps in the technological information base;
identification of those facilities that may be needed for future handling and treatment of these materials;
ensuring operational readiness in accordance with DOE Order 5480.31.



This integrated program plan will develop detailed schedules for specific activities cited in the Recommendation
and will include critical path activities; decision points, and resource considerations necessary for successful
program initiation and completions. The plan will be utilized as a tool to assist in determining the appropriate course
of action to expeditiously convert the material discussed in specific recommendations 3 through 7 to a form or condition
more suitable for interim storage.
The Department accepts Recommendation 94-1 conditioned upon the understanding that complete conversion
of all materials cited in your Recommendation may not be accomplished within the time periods described in the Recommendation.
We look forward to working closely with you and your staff to develop a responsive Implementation Plan and activity
schedules that meet our common goals. The Implementation Plan will be forwarded to you in accordance with 42 U.S.C.
2286d.
If you have further questions, please contact me, or have a member of your staff contact Mr. Thomas Grumbly, Assistant
Secretary for Environmental Management, at (202) 586-7710.


   Sincerely,

</SIGNJOB>

<DOCTITLE>Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership; Amendment </DOCTITLE>


August 29, 1994. 


Take notice that on August 25, 1994, Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership (Cove Point LNG), 2100 Cove Point Road, Lusby,
Maryland 20657, filed, in Docket No. CP94-59-002, an amendment to its certificate application filed
in Docket Nos. CP94-59-000 and 001. Cover Point LNG filed this amendment in response to the Commission's
July 27, 1994, Preliminary Determination (PD) concerning Cove Point LNG's proposal to acquire and reactivate the
mothballed LNG facility at Cove Point, Maryland. The Cove Point LNG facility is presently owned by Columbia LNG Corporation.
The PD rejected Cove Point LNG's proposal to charge market-based rates for its proposed peaking services and suggested
that Cove Point LNG file another rate proposal. This filing in Docket No. CP94-50-002 is Cove Point LNG's
new rate proposal and its response to certain tariff issues raised in the PD. Cove Point LNG now proposes to charge minimum
and maximum rates for its peaking services with the maximum rates capped at amounts based on the net present value and
levelized cost of competing services over ten- and twenty-year terms. Cove Point LNG requests that the Commission
act on its proposal and issue a final certificate on or before September 30, 1994. Cove Point LNG's proposal is more
fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said Amendment should on or before September
6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426,
a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure
(18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with
the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make
the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate
as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules; provided
however, that any person that has filed a previous motion to intervene in these proceedings need not file a new intervention.

 in the above-captioned proceeding, the Commission held that the filing raises certain issues for which a technical
conference is to be convened. These issues are (1) how the allocation of the nomination variance charges among shippers
will work; (2) why Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. believes to aggregate transportation receipts and/or
deliveries on a total points basis relaxes its nomination variance charges; and (3) the effect its proposal will have
on customers.




The conference to address the issues has been scheduled for Monday, September 19, 1994, at 10 a.m. in a room to be designated
at the offices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 810 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
All interested persons and Staff are permitted to attend.

Title:

 Diesel Fuel Quality Regulation Transfer Document Record Keeping Requirement (EPA ICR No. 1718.01). This ICR requests
approval of a new collection.


Abstract:

 On July 14, 1994 a revision to the Regulations of Fuels and Fuel Additives for Highway Diesel Fuel was published in the


Federal Register

 (59 FR 35854). The interim final rule continues to regulate on-highway diesel fuel, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 21, 1990 (54 FR 35276), by requiring that the fuel meet sulfur content standards, as well as standards for
cetane index or in the alternative for aromatic content. This revision, which goes into effect on October 1, 1994,
changes the language regarding the fuel dye color from blue to red. The revision requires that the fuel be free of visible
evidence of the dye Solvent Red 164 except as provided for tax exempt use in accordance with section 4082 of the Internal
Revenue Code. There will be a small portion of diesel fuel for use in motor vehicles that is both tax-exempt, requiring
it to be dyed red, and is also required to meet the on highway low sulfur diesel fuel requirements, requiring it to be
free of the visible evidence of the red dye. This overlap was addressed in EPA's July 14, 1994 revision to the fuel quality
standards by allowing the tax-exempt low sulfur fuel to contain visible evidence of the red dye provided that the fuel
meets the fuel quality standards and the shipments are accompanied by transfer documents indicating that the fuel
is for tax-exempt use only and meets the EPA diesel fuel quality standards. 
Product transfer documents are common standard industry papers that are produced by the transferor and accompany
each shipment to the transferee. This regulation will require the transferor of the fuel to provide the transferee
with documents to accompany each shipment of low sulfur fuel that has been dyed red. The documents are required to contain
language, or other such indication, verifying that the red dyed fuel meets the applicable fuel quality standards
and is for tax-exempt use. Copies of the documents must be retained in the possession of the transferor and the transferee
(shipment recipient) for a period of five years after the date of transfer. EPA will only request documentation from
the affected parties during inspections or other enforcement activities. EPA does not require that these documents
be routinely sent to the Agency for collection and review. EPA will use the documents to assist in enforcement of the
regulations. The documentation will assist the agency in ascertaining how to proceed when violations are found and
what party may be liable for enforcement action.
In summary, any party, including but not limited to, refiners, importers, distributors, resellers, carriers, retailers,
or wholesale purchaser consumers that use, or are the transferor or transferee of tax-exempt red dyed diesel fuel
for use in on-highway vehicles, must provide documents verifying that the fuel meets the applicable fuel quality
standards. 



Burden Statement:

 The public reporting burden for this recording requirement is estimated to average .02 hours per occurrence, including
time for reviewing the required document, and filing and retaining the required documents.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 4366.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 100 hours. 


Frequency of Collection:

 The documents will not be routinely collected by the Agency. The documents must be retained by the transferor and the
transferee for a period of five years after the date of transfer and must be made available to the Administrator or an
Agency official upon request.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 
aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20460.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the National Advisory
Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator
of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and this meeting is being held to discuss NACEPT's agenda for
the coming year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological,
economic, and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-driven approach to environmental management.


Three new NACEPT standing committees will be formed to examine different aspects of ecosystem management.
 One will evaluate the opportunities to re-orient existing statutory and regulatory authorities to integrate
place-driven environmental management into the Agency's decision-making process. Specific areas this committee
will investigate include enforcement and compliance programs, and financial and technical assistance mechanisms.
 Another committee will examine the role and use of data and information in ecosystem management strategies.
Some of the issues the committee will evaluate include data needs, data accessibility, and opportunities for partnerships
and data sharing with public and private sector organizations.
 The third committee will examine issues associated with harmonizing economic activity and ecosystem management,
and will focus on the economic, social, and political factors needed to achieve sustainable economies.
NACEPT comprises a representative cross-section of EPA's partners and constituents, but to gain additional insights
and perspectives from all interested parties as these committees begin their work, time has been allotted during
the meeting for oral comments from the public. Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these
issues can schedule an appointment by contacting Abby Pirnie at the address and telephone numbers listed below. Due
to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly held to five minutes and slots are limited. Available time
slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis to those scheduling a presentation in advance. Written
comments will be accepted at any time prior to the meeting.

<DOCTITLE>The Bank of New York Company, Inc.; Notice of Applications to Engage de novo in Permissible Nonbanking Activities;
Correction</DOCTITLE>


This notice corrects a notice (FR Doc. 94-16672) published on page 35347 of the issue for Monday, July 11, 1994.
Under the Federal Reserve Bank of New York heading, the entry for The Bank of New York Company, New York, New York, et
al. is revised to read as follows:


1. The Bank of New York Company, Inc.

, New York, New York; BayBanks, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts; The Chase Manhattan Corporation, New York, New York;
Chemical Banking Corporation, New York, New York; Citicorp, New York, New York; Fleet Financial Group, Inc., Providence,
Rhode Island; HSBC Holdings PLC, London, England; HSBC Holdings BV, The Netherlands; Marine Midland Banks, Inc.,
Buffalo, New York; Banco de Santander, S.A., Madrid, Spain; The Bank of Boston Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts;
First Fidelity Bancorporation, Lawrenceville, New Jersey; Shawmut National Corporation, Hartford, Connecticut;
National Westminster Bank PLC, London, England; and NatWest Holdings, Inc., New York, New York (collectively, Applicants),
have applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)
of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)) to engage through InfiNet Payment Services, Inc., Hackensack, New
Jersey (Company), in data processing and related nonbanking activities. Company will be formed through the merger
of NENI Corporation, which operates a retail electronic funds transfer (EFT) network under the tradename Yankee
24, and The New York Switch Corporation, which operates the NYCE EFT network under various tradenames.
In particular, Applicants propose to engage through Company in operating a retail EFT network, including the provision
of automated teller machine (ATM) services that will permit customers to make withdrawals, obtain cash advances
from lines of credit and credit card accounts, make deposit account inquiries, make transfers between accounts,
and make deposits to the extent permitted by applicable law. These ATM services also would include the processing
and transmission of data for bank participants in the network in connection with financial products offered to customers
of such participants that would allow those customers to transfer funds, by ``sweep'' arrangements or otherwise,
among their deposit accounts at the bank or other securities accounts maintained with affiliated or unaffiliated
mutual fund companies or securities brokers. Applicants also propose to engage in various additional activities
through Company, including the following: 
(1) point of sale (POS) services that will permit customers to use their ATM cards to purchase goods and services; 
(2) point of banking (POB) services that will permit customers to conduct transactions similar to those available
at ATM terminals, but with the help of a third party; 
(3) scrip services, in which a customer receives a voucher (scrip) that is redeemable for cash at a retail register;

(4) gateway services, by which Company will provide routing of transaction requests between Company's network and
other EFT networks for participants in Company's network; 
(5) group purchasing, in which Company will purchase EFT-related supplies, such as signage, statement stuffers,
and terminals, for the benefit of the financial institution participants in Company's network; 
(6) ownership of ATM terminals to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law; 
(7) terminal driving services, such as routine database management and maintenance, problem resolution, telecommunications,
help desk services, hardware maintenance, and currency provision;
(8) card production and issuance, including ordering and embossing cards, establishing cardholder records, and
assigning personal identification numbers; 
(9) electronic benefit transfer (EBT) services, in which recipients of government benefits such as food stamps and
other recurring types of government transfer payments could access their benefits at ATM and POS machines through
use of a card issued by a government agency; 
(10) home banking and bill payment services, in which customers could use devices such as the telephone, personal
computer, or interactive cable television to conduct a variety of banking transactions such as transferring money
between accounts, opening and closing accounts, and paying bills, as well as accessing banking, financial and economic
databases from the home or office; 
(11) providing certain additional services not generally available at ATM machines, such as printing full account
statements and dispensing travelers checks and postage stamps; 
(12) providing services in connection with stored value cards, including farecards used by public transportation
systems, which are capable of having value assigned to them by use of a magnetic strip or computer chip; 
(13) check verification services for retailers; 
(14) purchasing and reselling or renting electronic equipment used to perform EFT services; and 
(15) electronic data capture and electronic data interchange services, in which merchants are provided with information
relating to inventory and the buying patterns of customers. 
Applicants propose to engage in these activities worldwide. In this regard, Applicants propose to permit foreign
bank affiliates of domestic banking participants in the network, as well as other foreign banks, to participate in
the network. 


Closely Related to Banking Standard


Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto....'' In determining whether
a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 

inter

 

alia

, the matters set forth in 

National Courier Association

 v. 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are (1) whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed
services, (2) whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the
proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and (3) whether banks generally
provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized
form. 

See

 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable
or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y

, 49 

Federal

 

Register

 806 (1984). 
Applicants maintain that the Board has previously determined that the majority of the proposed activities are closely
related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act. Specifically, Applicants maintain that the proposed ATM services;
POS services; gateway services; terminal driving services; card production and issuance services; home banking
and bill payment services; group purchasing activities; EBT services; POB services; electronic data capture and
interchange services; scrip services; terminal ownership; and terminal sale, rental, and maintenance services
are data processing and transmission activities that the Board has determined by regulation to be closely related
to banking. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(7). 

See also Banc One Corporation, et al.

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1158 (1993) 

(Banc One)

; 

BayBanks, Inc., et al.

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 547 (1993); 

Banc One Corporation, et al.

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 156-57 (1993); 

BankAmerica Corporation

, 78 Federal Reserve Bulletin 299 (1992). Applicants further maintain that the Board also has previously determined
by regulation that the issuance and sale of travelers checks, and the proposed check verification services, are closely
related to banking. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(12) and (b)(22). In addition, Applicants maintain that the Board has previously determined by order
that the proposed stored value card services are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act. 

See Banc One, supra

. Applicants propose to conduct the foregoing activities in accordance with the limitations set forth in Regulation
Y and the Board's prior orders. 
Applicants also maintain that dispensing stamps and full statement printing are activities closely related to banking
because banks conduct these activities. In this regard, Applicants state that national banks may operate postal
substations pursuant to rulings issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 

See

 12 CFR 7.7482. Applicants further state that banks are required to deliver periodic account statements to customers
under regulations issued by the Board. 

See

 12 CFR 205.9 and 230.6. In addition, Applicants maintain that the proposed farecard activities are closely related
to banking because farecards are a form of stored value card and serve as a medium of exchange.


Proper Incident to Banking Standard


In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
Applicants believe that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicants maintain that the proposal will enhance customer convenience and efficiency. In addition,
Applicants state that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. In publishing
the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal
is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and
does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC
Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than September 26, 1994. Any request
for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)),
be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, or the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

Announcement of a Grant to the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences 



Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds for fiscal year (FY) 1994
for a sole source grant with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The purpose of this
program is to consolidate assistance mechanisms used to support the current research activities conducted by IOM,
integrate newly initiated assistance activities that are of special interest to CDC, and establish a systematic
procedure for managing the unique scientific relationship between CDC and IOM. During FY 1993, CDC initiated three
distinct funding mechanisms to support IOM research in the areas of unintended pregnancy, tobacco prevention strategies
for youth, and comprehensive school health programs. This grant program would provide for a more uniform management
of the various research activities to be funded in the future. 

Approximately $365,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund three projects of special interest to CDC: 

Project 1. Comprehensive School Health_Approximately $125,000 is available for the continuation of activities
to assess the status of existing comprehensive school health programs including K-12 school health education,
school health promotion and disease prevention, and school based health care delivery, examine factors predictive
of success or failure, and identify and disseminate strategies for wider implementation of comprehensive school
health programs. 

Project 2. Epidemiological Dimensions of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in the United States_Approximately
$225,000 is available to support a new study designed to examine the epidemiological dimensions of STDs in the United
States and the factors contributing to the rising incidence of infections, assess the effectiveness (including
cost-effectiveness) and efficiency of current public health strategies and programs to prevent and control STDs,
and develop recommendations for future public health programs, policy development, and research in this area, particularly
in the context of health care reform and the trend towards managed care approaches to health services delivery and
financing. 

Project 3. Study on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths_Approximately $15,000 is available to
continue and enhance activities related to Native American youth in an existing study of prevention strategies for
children and adolescents relative to tobacco consumption. This study will summarize studies on the biology of addiction,
social and behavioral factors involved in initiation, and interventions to prevent dependence and enhance cessation.


It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project
period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project
period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. CDC anticipates the availability
of additional funds during FY 1995 and subsequent years to support projects of special scientific, programmatic,
and/or administrative importance to the mission of CDC. The availability of funds and the focus of such projects are
expected to emphasize activities in smoking, nutrition, diabetes, chronic disease control, reproductive health,
surveillance and analysis, cancer, and STDs but may include other disease prevention and control areas of special
interest to CDC. The availability of funds in subsequent years will be announced in a Program Guidance document accompanying
the application kit for each year of the project period. Projects proposed in response to annual Program Guidance
documents will be subjected to an Objective Review based on the Evaluation Criteria contained in this Program Announcement.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality
of life. This announcement focuses on all priority areas of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'') 



Authority 



This project is authorized under sections 301(a), [42 U.S.C. 241 (a)] and 318(a), [42 U.S.C. 247c (a)] of the Public
Health Service Act, as amended, and Executive Order 12832 dated January 19, 1993. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicant 



Assistance will be provided only to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for this project.
No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to NAS. 

The mission of CDC is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease and disability. To
accomplish this mission, CDC works in partnership with public, private, and voluntary organizations that may be
for profit or not for profit groups operating at the State, local, national, and international level to: 

1. Monitor the status of diseases. 

2. Detect and investigate health problems. 

3. Conduct research to enhance prevention. 

4. Develop and advocate sound public health policies. 

5. Carry out strategies for the prevention of disease. 

6. Promote healthy behaviors. 

7. Foster safe and healthy environments. 

8. Control risk factors leading to the development of disease. 

In defining the scientific basis and operational direction for achieving its mission, CDC must frequently obtain
independent advice that is inherently acceptable to the American public, of unparalleled objectivity, and unquestionable
quality. Occasionally, these conditions can only be met by using a unique relationship and mechanisms established
for these purposes by the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government. 

NAS was chartered by the U.S. Congress under an Act of Incorporation and approved by the President in 1863. The Act required
the Academy to ``. . . investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or
art, the actual expense of such . . . to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose.
. . .'' Pursuant to the charter, IOM was established in 1970. NAS and IOM operate in the national interest
by assembling the Nation's eminent scholars in a variety of commissions, boards, offices, and committees to furnish
advice and guidance of unparalleled objectivity. The findings and recommendations of IOM, NAS, are accorded a degree
of acceptance unequaled by any other body of American scholars. 

During FY 1993, CDC conducted individual reviews of the technical and scientific merits of two requests for assistance
submitted by IOM. Independent funding mechanisms were implemented to support IOM research in the areas of Comprehensive
School Health, and Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths. These studies, listed as Projects 1. and
3., are now well into their second year and cannot be duplicated by any other organization without significant unnecessary
cost to CDC. 

In March 1994, the IOM convened a one-day meeting to consider plans for an IOM study of efforts to control STDs in the
United States, as well as directions for future public health policy and research in this area. The planning group
agreed that such a study could make an important contribution to the STD and public health field and could offer useful
guidance in shaping future programs and policies to contain the epidemic of STDs in the United States. The planning
group encouraged IOM staff to proceed in further developing plans for this study. As a result, the IOM submitted a proposal
for the study, Project 2., to the CDC. The proposed study is consistent with the mission of the CDC. Completion of the
study and efficient implementation of its findings and recommendations requires that the work be performed with
an unquestionable level of objectivity, that it have immediate credibility, and carry a high degree of public acceptance.
IOM is the only body of American scholars fulfilling the requirement for this study. 

In accordance with Executive Order 12832, when CDC determines that IOM, because of its unique qualifications, is
the only source that can provide the expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to
meet program requirements, services of the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations.

submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that animal drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For animal drug products,
the testing phase begins on the earlier date when either a major environmental effects test was initiated for the drug
or when an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective and runs until
the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the animal
drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory
review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may
award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent
was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for an animal drug product will include
all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 
35 U.S.C. 156(g)(4)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the animal drug product Aviax

 

 (semduramicin sodium). Aviax

 

 is indicated for prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark
Office received a patent term restoration application for Aviax

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,804,680) from Pfizer Inc. and requested FDA's assistance in determining the patent's eligibility
for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated July 8, 1994, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this
animal drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of Aviax

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Aviax

 

 is 2,438 days. Of this time, 736 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 1,702
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: July 9, 1987. The applicant claims October 1, 1987, as the date the investigational new animal drug application (INAD)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the date of FDA's official acknowledgement letter assigning
a number to the INAD was July 9, 1987, which is considered to be the effective date for the INAD. 
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the animal drug product application under section
512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: July 13, 1989. The applicant claims July 12, 1989, as the date the new animal drug application (NADA) for Aviax

 

 (NADA 140-940) was initially submitted. However, a review of FDA records reveals that the date of FDA's official
acknowledgement letter assigning a number to the NADA was July 13, 1989, which is considered to be the initially submitted
date for the NADA. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: March 10, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NADA 140-940 was approved on March 10, 1994.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 755 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before November 7, 1994, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before March 6, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. 
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Memorandum of Understanding Between the Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Service, Department of Health
and Human Services of the United States of America and the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry and the State Committee
For Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance of the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation and Information
Exchange on Drugs and Biological Products Facilitating Importation



The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States (U.S.), on the one hand, and the Ministry of Health and Medical
Industry and the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance of the Russian Federation, on the
other hand, hereinafter referred to as the participants,



Building upon the foundation laid by the Memorandum of Understanding signed at Moscow September 23, 1993 under the
auspices of the U.S.-Russia Business Development Committee's Subgroup on Medical Equipment, Pharmaceuticals,
and Health Services, and in accordance with the Agreement on Cooperation in the Fields of Public Health and Biomedical
Research signed on January 14, 1994 by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian
Federation, 

Strengthening the bonds of friendship among the participants,

Have reached the following understanding to guide their cooperation:



I.



The goals of the participants in entering into this Memorandum of Understanding are to:



1. Exchange information on drugs and biological products and on requirements applicable to them (including standardization,
registration, quality control, and product side effects), including prompt exchange of information on removal
of drugs and biological products from the market or restrictions on their use. 
 
2. Facilitate the development of the Russian health care sector by establishing in Russia a streamlined registration
procedure for U.S. drugs and biological products that are produced in the United States and that FDA permits to be freely
marketed in the United States (see Annex). The Russian Federation participants will use this streamlined procedure
for such United States products.



This Memorandum of Understanding provides the procedures needed to implement the agreement in the earlier Memorandum
of Understanding, signed on September 23, 1993, that it would be mutually beneficial for the participants to work
together to streamline the process for registering and certifying U.S. drugs and biological products for importation
into the Russian Federation when these products are permitted by FDA to be freely marketed in the United States. The
effect of the participants' joint endeavors under this Memorandum of Understanding will be to extend to Russian users
access to U.S. drugs and biological products of the same safety, effectiveness, and quality available to U.S. users
of such products.




II.



This Memorandum of Understanding covers drugs and biological products that are produced in the United States and
that are permitted by FDA to be freely marketed in the United States including:

1. Drugs: articles that meet the definition of a drug under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This Memorandum
of Understanding does not apply to homeopathic drugs.

2. Biological products: products that are regulated as biological products under the U.S. Public Health Service
Act.




III.



1. The Russian Federation participants will streamline their registration requirements of those U.S. drugs and
biological products that are produced in the United States and that are permitted by FDA to be freely marketed in the
United States. 

2. For drugs and biological products that are produced in the United States and that FDA permits to be freely marketed
in the United States, the Russian Federation participants will accept FDA's decisions and regulations on premarket
approval, licensing, monographs, and related matters, as well as FDA's product quality standards and enforcement
of manufacturing controls and other requirements. 

3. All products that can be defined as a controlled substance or highly addictive can be registered in the Russian Federation
only after receiving the approval of the Russian Federation's State Committee on Controlled Substances. Products
for which this approval will be necessary will be further explained in an exchange of letters between the participants.

4. This Memorandum of Understanding sets forth, in an Annex, the information that United States firms will have to
submit to the appropriate Russian Federation participant concerning drugs and biological products subject to this
Memorandum of Understanding, produced in the United States, and permitted by FDA to be freely marketed in the United
States, to obtain permission for these products to be freely marketed in the Russian Federation. Where the necessary
information listed in the Annex is submitted, the Russian Federation participants will not require, as a condition
of importation, the conduct of any additional clinical or analytical review or testing. Registration shall take
no more than 90 days after the submission to the appropriate Russian Federation participant of the information required
in the Annex and any fee required by the Russian Federation. At the time of the request for registration of vaccines
and sera, the Russian Federation has the right to require additional documents which will satisfy the Russian Federation's
requirements. Cases in which additional documentation will be necessary will be further explained in an exchange
of letters between the participants.

5. Upon request of the Russian Federation participants, FDA will provide access to information on the compliance
status of drugs and biological products and manufacturers that are eligible for Russian Federation registration
under this Memorandum of Understanding to the extent that the information disclosure is in accordance with U.S. law.
FDA also will respond to inquiries from the Russian Federation participants about information submitted under the
Annex with respect to such matters as the marketing status of any drug or biological products. The participants will
share information about any drug or biological product that presents a significant risk to users.
 
6. Under this Memorandum of Understanding, the participants will share expertise and provide assistance and information
to one another when necessary, subject to the availability of funds. Upon request of FDA, the Russian Federation participants
will treat as confidential any information provided to it by FDA that is not public information. Upon request of a Russian
Federation participant, FDA will likewise respect the confidentiality of information that the Russian Federation
participant provides to FDA, to the extent permitted by law.

7. FDA will provide the Russian Federation participants with up-to-date copies of the laws, regulations, guidelines,
and procedures used to help ensure that drugs and biological products are of a level of quality sufficient for the protection
of the public health. The Russian Federation participants will provide FDA with up-to-date copies of laws, regulations,
guidelines, and procedures concerning the registration of these products imported into the Russian Federation
from foreign countries in general and from the United States in particular.

8. The participants will meet periodically to consult with each other in order to promote cooperation and to facilitate
the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding. As the need arises, the participants will develop and agree
on specific plans of cooperation.

9. The participants may establish a coordinating committee and one or more technical committees composed of representatives
of each participant with expertise in regulation of drugs and biological products, to assist in the implementation
of the Memorandum of Understanding.

10. The participants will enter into, within six months of the effective date of this Memorandum of Understanding,
additional Memoranda of Understanding concerning certain foods and medical devices imported into the Russian Federation
from the United States.


IV. 



The following offices are designated as liaison offices for the participants:



A. For FDA:

Medicare Program; Criteria and Standards for Evaluating Intermediary and Carrier Performance During FY 1994 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 General notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the September 30, 1993 issue of the 

Federal Register

, we published a general notice with comment period describing the criteria and standards for evaluating intermediary
and carrier performance in administering the Medicare program during FY 1994. This notice amends that document to
require that contractors certify the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted to HCFA with respect
to the evaluation process. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On September 30, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51085) the criteria and standards to be used for evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and carriers
in the administration of the Medicare program beginning October 1, 1993 under the Contractor Performance Evaluation
Program (CPEP). We publish a similar notice annually in accordance with sections 1816(f) and 1842(b) of the Social
Security Act. CPEP measures contractor compliance with program requirements; promotes contractor initiatives
to improve administrative processes; provides comparable data on customer satisfaction; and serves as a basis of
information for contract management activities. The results of the CPEP are considered whenever HCFA enters into,
renews, or terminates an intermediary agreement or carrier contract or takes other contract actions. 

The 1994 CPEP was structured into three criteria, designed to meet the above objectives. Criterion one, titled Program
Requirements, measures contractor performance against basic program requirements. Within this criterion, we
identified performance standards which, when measured, evidence how well each contractor is performing the basic
requirements of administering the Medicare program. Criterion two, titled Process Improvement, recognizes contractor
performance improvement (compared to the previous review period) and contractor efforts to achieve program efficiencies
by evaluating and improving the processes with which it administers the Medicare program. Criterion three, titled
Customer Satisfaction, assesses the degree to which the contractor's customers are satisfied with the services
provided by the contractor in its administration of the Medicare program. We also developed separate criteria and
standards that measure only the activities of regional home health intermediaries and Common Working File hosts.




II. Amendment to the FY 1994 CPEP Notice 



The notice published on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51085), in addition to providing detailed descriptions of the specific
CPEP criteria, standards, and procedures, included a summary of how the performance evaluations and assessments
affect individual contract action decisions. The summary was contained on page 50190 and was entitled ``Action Based
on Performance Evaluations.'' In our discussion of action to be taken based on performance, we did not address a situation
that could arise if we did not receive accurate information from our contractors. 

We have discovered a number of instances where information has been manipulated or falsified by contractor personnel
in an effort to receive a more favorable evaluation under CPEP. On October 28, 1993, we issued notices to each of the
Medicare contractors that they must certify that all information submitted to HCFA with respect to CPEP for fiscal
year 1993 was accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief. We also informed the Medicare contractors
that we would modify the annual CPEP notice to include mention of the requirement that they certify, under penalty
of perjury, the accuracy of the information reviewed and data submitted to HCFA with respect to CPEP. The modification
does not alter the criteria and standards that were effective October 1, 1993. 

So that our public notice relating to CPEP accurately reflects our administration of the evaluation program, we are
revising Section H. Action Based on Performance Evaluations (page 50190 of the 1994 CPEP notice published September
30, 1993) by adding the following: 




Each contractor must certify that all information submitted to HCFA related to CPEP, including without limitation
all records, reports, files, papers and other information, whether in written, electronic, or other form, are accurate
and complete to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief. A contractor will also be required to certify that
its files, records, documents, and data have not been manipulated or falsified in an effort to receive a more favorable
performance evaluation. A contractor must further certify that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the contractor
has submitted, without withholding any relevant information, all information required to be submitted with respect
to CPEP under the authority of applicable law(s), regulation(s), contracts, or HCFA manual provision(s). Any contractor
that makes a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution,
as well as appropriate administrative action. Such administrative action may include debarment or suspension of
the contractor, as well as the termination or nonrenewal of a contract. 




For the convenience of the reader, the full text of Section H is republished below with the addition found in the first
paragraph.

A contractor's performance is evaluated against each applicable standard in the Program Requirements criterion.
Each contractor must certify that all information submitted to HCFA related to CPEP, including without limitation
all records, reports, files, papers and other information, whether in written, electronic, or other form, are accurate
and complete to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief. A contractor will also be required to certify that
its files, records, documents, and data have not been manipulated or falsified in an effort to receive a more favorable
performance evaluation. A contractor must further certify that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the contractor
has submitted, without withholding any relevant information, all information required to be submitted with respect
to CPEP under the authority of applicable law(s), regulation(s), contracts, or HCFA manual provision(s). Any contractor
that makes a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution,
as well as appropriate administrative action. Such administrative action may include debarment or suspension of
the contractor, as well as the termination or nonrenewal of a contract. If a contractor meets the level of performance
required by operational instructions, it meets the requirements of that standard. Any performance measured below
basic operational expectations constitutes a deficiency. The contractor may be required to develop and implement
a corrective action plan when performance problems are identified. The contractor will be monitored to assure effective
and efficient compliance with the corrective action plan and improved performance where standards are not met. 

A contractor's performance is assessed under the Process Improvement criterion to determine the success of the improvements
developed and/or implemented by the contractor during the review period. A contractor's performance is similarly
assessed under the Customer Satisfaction criterion to determine the degree to which the contractor has satisfied
its customers. 

The results of performance evaluations and assessments under all three criteria will be used for contract management
activities and will be published in the contractor's annual performance report. We may initiate administrative
actions as a result of the evaluation of contractor performance based on these performance criteria and standards.
Under sections 1816 and 1842 of the Act, we consider the results of the evaluation in our determinations on: 

 Entering into, renewing, or terminating agreements or contracts with contractors; and 

 Decisions concerning other contract actions for intermediaries and carriers (such as deletion of an automatic
renewal clause). These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and depend primarily on the nature and degree of
performance. More specifically, they depend on:

 


_Relative overall performance compared to other contractors; 

_Number of standards in which deficient performance occurs; 

_Extent of each deficiency;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Relative significance of the standards for which deficient performance occurs within the overall CPEP; and 
_Efforts to improve program quality, service, and efficiency.

 

 Decisions concerning the assignment or reassignment of providers and designation of regional or national
intermediaries for classes of providers. 
We make individual contract action decisions after considering these factors in terms of their relative significance
and impact on the effective and efficient administration of the Medicare program. 


III. Effective Date 


As stated in the September 30 notice, we make every effort to publish the CPEP criteria and standards prior to the beginning
of the Federal fiscal year to which they will be applied, and it is not our intention to revise the criteria and standards
once this information has been published in the 

Federal Register

. Should changes be necessary, we will issue a 

Federal Register

 notice prior to implementation of the changes and specify a prospective effective date applicable to the revised
standard or criterion. In this instance, the addition of this certification requirement to our discussion of actions
based on performance evaluations does not alter any standard or criterion published September 30, 1993. Therefore,
this notice is effective September 6, 1994. 
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this notice was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Cooperative Agreement Award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces
its intent to award funds in FY 1994 to support a cooperative agreement with the National Rural Health Association
(NRHA), Kansas City, MO.




The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy seeks solutions to the health care problems of rural communities by working
with Federal agencies, the States, national associations, foundations and private sector organizations. This
award will initiate a number of projects designed to (1) help build State and local infrastructure through a variety
of approaches including workshops, conferences, technical assistance, etc. and (2) develop and provide current
information to a wide audience through various mechanisms including journals, meetings, publications, etc. During
1995, significant investment will be made in a project that supports the President's Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
Communities (EZ/EC) Initiative. Resources, information, and technical assistance will be made available to 3 EZ
and 30 EC (rural) to help foster community based solutions to local health care problems. This cooperative agreement
will create an ongoing partnership with significant involvement and input from the ORHP into the design, development
and implementation of all projects.

HRSA plans to award this cooperative agreement to the NRHA because of its unique characteristics, skills and superior
qualifications in the area of rural health care. NRHA is the only organization with a broad and diverse membership
from rural areas throughout the country, a clear mission to improve the delivery of health services in rural areas,
and the staff capability to provide research, educational, leadership, and information support to help rural citizens
build, maintain and improve the institutions that can meet their health care needs. Accordingly, HRSA has determined
that there is adequate basis for awarding this cooperative agreement to the NRHA without competition.

This cooperative agreement is authorized under section 301 of the PHS Act, with funds appropriated under Public Law
103-112 (HHS Appropriations Act for FY 1994).




AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS: 

Approximately $530,000 will be made available for obligation to support the cooperative agreement for a budget period
of one year and a project period of three years beginning in FY 1994. Approximately $350,000 of the total will be allocated
to support the EZ/EC Initiative.




OTHER AWARD INFORMATION: 

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs
(as implemented by 45 CFR Part 100).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, Department of the Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Availability of final environmental impact statement/general management plan for Jewel Cave National Monument.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces
the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan (FEIS/GMP) for Jewel Cave National
Monument, South Dakota.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FEIS/GMP analyzes two alternatives to protect resources while providing for visitor use of the monument. Under
Alternative A, the no-action alternative, existing programs, development, and trends (including implementation
of the draft Resource Management Plan) would continue, but new facilities and interpretation would not be added.
In the proposed action (alternative B); emphasis would be on protection of Jewel Cave through understanding and mitigation
of the effects on cave resources caused by surface facilities and activities. Visitor safety would be given a high
priority; access for visitors with disabilities would be improved; interpretation would be expanded to help visitors
better understand the relationship between surface and subsurface resources; and the National Park Service would
pursue cooperative ventures and boundary expansion to protect cave resources.




The FEIS/GMP in particular evaluates the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the other alternatives
on cave resources, geology, soils and vegetation, wildlife, water resources, air quality, cultural resources,
visitor experience, socioeconomic environment, and management and operations.

General Management Plan Amendment; Presidio of San Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area; Availability
of Final General Management Plan Amendment and Final Environmental Impact Statement


Summary: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-190, as amended), the
National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a Final General Management Plan Amendment/Environmental
Impact Statement (FGMPA/FEIS) that describes and analyzes a proposed action and three alternatives for the future
management and use of the Presidio of San Francisco, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, California. The FGMPA/FEIS
is being presented in two companion documents_the FGMPA, which describes the proposed action in detail; and the FEIS,
which presents the proposal and three alternatives, along with the analysis of the environmental consequences of
their respective implementations.


The draft General Management Plan Amendment/Environmental Impact Statement (DGMPA/DEIS) were released for public
review on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54372), and the public comment period closed December 21, 1993. During this period,
three informal meetings and five public meetings were held; written comments were also received. The FGMPA/FEIS
contain responses to the comments received and modifications to the text as needed in response to the comments.
The proposed action and alternatives all have been designed to protect and preserve exceptional resources and to
meet planning objectives and goals for the future Presidio. They differ primarily in approach to overall management,
level and extent of resource preservation and enhancement, and diversity and level of visitor programs. The proposed
action, Alternative A, provides goals for creating a park setting where cultural and natural resources are preserved
and enhanced; and major new programs are established through public/private partnerships to provide an understanding
of those resources, encourage stewardship and cultural awareness, promote international exchange, and seek solutions
to critical global problems. A federally chartered partnership institution would be created through congressional
legislation to assist in managing park partners, and legislation would also be sought to include the former Public
Health Service Hospital complex within the Presidio. Modifications have been made to the proposal based on public
comment and clarification of Army re-use needs. The changes primarily relate to additional clarification regarding
the amount and type of new construction, Army reuse, remediation of environmental hazards, the preservation of historic
buildings, building demolition, the jobs/housing balance, addition of adjacent Lobos Creek undeveloped lots,
tenant management, the type of partnership institution assisting with management, dog walking, Crissy Field parking
and boardsailing access, Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District maintenance facilities, the
importance of the Presidio's history and potential museum opportunities, affirmative action programs, Letterman
complex reuse, and the Lobos Creek maintenance facility.
Alternative B, the no action/minimum requirements option, uses existing authorities for management, provides
fewer visitor programs and opportunities, and excludes the former Public Health Service Hospital from the park boundaries.
Alternative C, the expanded open space, restoration and interpretation option, provides a high level of overall
resource protection similar to Alternative A, but relies on existing management authorities, as in Alternative
B. As with Alternative B, the Public Health Service Hospital is excluded from the park boundaries, and in addition,
under this option, the Letterman Army Hospital and Research Center would be excluded. Alternative D, the partial
military reuse option, shares Alternative B's lower level of overall resource protection and fewer visitor programs
and opportunities, but is similar to Alternative A with respect to inclusion of the former Public Health Service Hospital
and the necessity of obtaining legislation for new management authorities.
Major impact topics assessed for the proposed action and alternatives include natural and cultural resources; traffic
and transportation systems; city services; native plant communities; regional economy and employment; noise;
and air quality.



Supplementary Information: 

The 30-day no action period will expire on September 26, 1994. Requests for information on the FGMPA/FEIS should be
directed to: Superintendent, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Building 201, Fort Mason, San Francisco, CA
94123. Telephone (415) 556-3111.


Copies will be available at the Presidio Project Office: Building 102, Montgomery Street, Presidio of San Francisco,
CA 94129. Additional copies will be available for inspection at libraries located in the San Francisco Bay area; the
Department of Interior Library; the National Park Service Public Affairs Office, 1849 C Street NW., Washington,
DC 20240; and at the Western Regional Office, National Park Service, Division of Planning, Grants and Environmental
Quality, 600 Harrison, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107-1372. In addition, all Federal Repository libraries
will receive copies.

<DOCTITLE>General Management Plan, Final Environmental Impact Statement, Wind Cave National Park, SD</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, Department of the Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan for Wind Cave National Park.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces
the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan (FEIS/GMP) for Wind Cave National
Park, South Dakota.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FEIS/GMP analyzes three alternatives to ensure the long-term preservation of the significant resources and
provide for public use and enjoyment of the park's many features. The no-action alternative (Alternative A) would
continue current management and operations in existing facilities. The proposed plan (Alternative B) would increase
visitor services, improve administrative and maintenance facilities, address health and safety issues, and improve
employee housing, while mitigating effects of surface facilities and activities on the cave and providing for additional
visitor use. There would be no significant change in the current level, type and location of development. Alternative
C is similar to the proposed plan, but would also remove the campground, eliminate the concession, remove the sewage
lagoons and install a discharging tertiary wastewater treatment plant and remove the bison fence.


The FEIS/GMP in particular evaluates the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the other alternatives
on cave geology, soils, and vegetation; wildlife; water resources; air quality; cultural resources; visitor use;
socioeconomic effects; and management and operations.

John W. Copeland, M.D.; Revocation of Registration



On September 9, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to John W. Copeland, M.D. (Respondent), of Antioch, California, proposing to
revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AC8638085, and to deny any pending applications for registration
as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a). The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration
is inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4) and that Respondent
was convicted of a felony under State law relating to controlled substances, as set forth in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2). Specifically,
the Order to Show Cause alleged that between December 1987 and October 1989, Respondent dispensed Ritalin, a Schedule
II controlled substance, to ten individuals for other than legitimate medical purposes and outside the scope of his
professional practice; between January 1988 and October 1989, Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids, Schedule
III controlled substances under applicable state law, to fifteen individuals for other than legitimate medical
purposes and outside the scope of his professional practice; and on May 30, 1991, Respondent was convicted in the State
of California of six felony counts of prescribing controlled substances to addicts or habitual users of controlled
substances and such prescriptions were not issued as part of an authorized methadone program.

Respondent, through counsel, timely filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause and
the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a
hearing was held, beginning on June 29, 1993, in San Francisco, California.

On April 21, 1994, Judge Bittner issued her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and
decision, recommending that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. Respondent filed exceptions
to the administrative law judge's decision pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66, and attached a Stipulation, Decision and Order
of the Medical Board of California (MBC), dated March 30, 1994, which allowed Respondent to retain all controlled
substance privileges except that Respondent was prohibited from handling anabolic steroids and was allowed to use
Schedule II controlled substances only in a hospital setting. The MBC order also placed Respondent's medical license
on probation for five years with various other conditions. The Government filed a response to Respondent's exceptions.

On May 23, 1994, Judge Bittner transmitted the record of the proceedings, including the Respondent's exceptions
and the Government's response thereto, to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered
the record and adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety. Pursuant
to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator hereby issues his final order in this matter.

The Deputy Administrator finds that Respondent has had a solo practice in family and emergency medicine since 1967.
For a short time in 1969 to 1971, he volunteered as a treating physician in a drug addiction clinic. Sometime after this
clinic closed in 1971, Respondent continued to treat some of the former patients of this clinic in the course of his
general practice. At no time did Respondent ever posses a DEA registration to operate a narcotic treatment program
as required by 21 U.S.C. 823(g).

Respondent's treatment of drug addiction was not the subject of any law enforcement investigation until 1988, when
one of his patients was arrested and found with prescription vials for Tylenol with codeine, a Schedule III controlled
substance, and Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance. The prescribing physician was Respondent. When asked
about these prescriptions, Respondent stated that they were issued to treat the patient for heroin addiction. As
a result, the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) commenced an investigation of Respondent's medical
practice.

In April 1988, a BNE undercover operative made her first visit to Respondent's office and informed him that she was
addicted to Ritalin and that she also abused methamphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance. Respondent issued
her a prescription for 60 dosage units of Ritalin. She returned to Respondent's office three weeks later, seeking
a refill before her first Ritalin prescription should have expired. Respondent complied by issuing her another prescription
for 60 dosage units of Ritalin. She made two more visits to Respondent's office (about a month apart) and each time Respondent
issued her another Ritalin prescription, one for 50 dosage units and the other for 60 dosage units. She did not return
to Respondent's office until May of 1989, at which time she saw Respondent's associate physician who prescribed her
only 8 dosage units of Ritalin to hold her until she could see Respondent. Three days later, when she saw Respondent,
he decided not to reissue her a Ritalin prescription. Respondent, however, suggested that she ``quit speed'' and
use marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance, instead.

A patient who had been treated by Respondent with controlled substances for drug addiction since 1974 agreed to act
as an undercover operative along with a police detective who posed as her boyfriend. During their visit in April 1989,
Respondent admonished the female undercover operative for missing a prior appointment by stating, ``Where are you
going to find a doctor doing what I am doing?'' Respondent did not issue her a Valium prescription as she requested,
but issued her a prescription for 40 dosage units of Restoril, a Schedule IV controlled substance. Her medical bill
indicated that the prescription was issued for drug withdrawal.

Although the undercover detective was not seeking treatment, Respondent asked him if he had any problems. When the
detective answered that he liked methamphetamine but that his drug problem was not as bad as his girlfriend's addiction,
Respondent wrote the detective a prescription for 60 dosage units of Restoril. The detective returned to Respondent's
office less than a month later and again stated that he was abusing methamphetamine. Respondent issued him another
prescription for 60 dosage units of Restoril and then asked the detective if he shared the drugs with his girlfriend.
When the detective responded in the affirmative Respondent increased the Restoril prescription to 80 dosage units.
In addition, Respondent dispensed 30 dosage units of Fastin, a Schedule IV controlled substance used for diet control,
to the detective. Respondent explained that he wanted the detective to stop taking methamphetamine and instead use
``legal'' drugs.



Several of Respondent's patients were arrested in 1989. One was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
The day before her arrest, Respondent had issued her a prescription for 100 dosage units of Valium, a Schedule IV controlled
substance, a prescription for 100 dosage units of Darvocet, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and a prescription
for 60 dosage units of Restoril. At the time of the arrest only 50 dosage units of Valium and 73 dosage units of Darvocet
remained in the vials. Following the arrest, it was determined that the individual was a drug addict whom Respondent
was treating.




One of Respondent's employees stated that many of Respondent's patients were drug addicts. This statement was confirmed
when many of Respondent's patient files were seized during a state criminal search warrant executed at Respondent's
office on October 17, 1989. The files revealed that 150 patients who were addicts were being treated with controlled
substances; another 16 patients who were addicts were no longer being treated by Respondent. Many of these patients
continually received controlled substances for a number of years. For example, one patient received 4,005 dosage
units of Tylenol with codeine 

#

4, 2,330 dosage units of Valium 10 mg., and 900 dosage units of phenobarbital, a Schedule IV controlled substance,
between January 22, 1987, and October 12, 1989.

Respondent was interviewed about his treatment of drug addicts during the execution of the October 1989 search warrant.
Respondent stated that patients were required to pay cash and that he determined that certain individuals were drug
addicts based upon physical indications and discussions with his nurse, a former drug addict. He admitted, however,
that he did not perform blood or urine tests because they were too expensive and did not keep any recovery logs for these
patients, to memorialize the quantity and length of time that drugs are prescribed and what recovery programs the
addict attends. Respondent also disclosed that after he learned that some of his drug addict patients were selling
the drugs he prescribed, he raised his treatment prices, so that his patients would have less financial incentive
to sell their drugs.






Two physician expert reports found that Respondent was not acting in the course of professional medical practice
by prescribing the dosages of controlled substances that he did, especially when he was aware that the patients were
drug addicts.




The BNE investigation also focused on Respondent's prescribing and dispensing of anabolic steroids. In June 1987,
an investigator from the then-California Board of Medical Quality Assurance (now MBC) had a discussion with Respondent
about allegations that Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids to high school students. Respondent denied such
allegations and maintained that he lectured high school students on the health hazards of using such substances.
On April 3, 1989, a BNE investigator also discussed the use of anabolic steroids with Respondent. When Respondent
opined that such substances could be dispensed to enhance a person's physical appearance under close medical supervision,
the investigator informed him of the California statute that classified anabolic steroids as controlled substances
which became effective in 1986. Respondent also stated that he was discontinuing the dispensing and prescribing
of anabolic steroids because he had heard rumors that the police were planning to make an undercover purchase of these
substances from him.

The BNE investigation also revealed that Respondent was one of the two highest purchasers of Anavar, an anabolic steroid,
from a particular supplier between 1985 and 1988. Some of Respondent's employees divulged that Respondent prescribed,
dispensed and administered anabolic steroids out of his office to young adult males for the purpose of body enhancement.
These employees also disclosed that Respondent required cash payments and that Respondent seldom conducted blood
tests on these individuals.

A police detective admitted that he had received steroids from Respondent in 1988. Another officer, who also admitted
to obtaining anabolic steroids from Respondent for purposes of body enhancement, indicated he used steroids based
upon Respondent's recommendation. While a BNE investigator was executing the search warrant at Respondent's office
on October 17, 1989, she encountered a patient who was there to obtain anabolic steroids for body enhancement. The
individual explained to her that when he initially obtained steroids from Respondent he was not warned about any dangers
that accompanied the use of such substances. He was only given one initial blood test by Respondent.

Patient files recovered from Respondent's office revealed that many had received steroids from Respondent since
1987. Few, if any, blood tests were conducted on these patients. Another patient obtained anabolic steroids from
Respondent after the patient revealed that he had taken these substances in the past, was depressed and attempted
suicide ten months earlier. There were ten patients who obtained anabolic steroids from Respondent after April 3,
1989, the date when Respondent was informed by a BNE investigator that anabolic steroids were controlled substance
under California law; one patient received nine injections in May and June of 1989. The patient files revealed that
97 patients received anabolic steroids from Respondent during the three years preceding the execution of the search
warrant and that another 103 patients had previously received anabolic steroids from Respondent.

A number of medical journal articles concerning the dangers of continual anabolic steroid use were introduced into
evidence. These articles revealed that use of such substances was associated with certain psychological problems
such as irritability, violent aggression, forgetfulness, confusion, abrupt mood swings and depression. Such use
also was correlated with physiological problems such as decreased libido, insomnia, anorexia and metabolic disturbances.
Many of these problems were reversible if the patient discontinued the use of these substances.

An expert physician reviewed Respondent's patient records and concluded that 24 patients obtained anabolic steroids
from Respondent not for legitimate medical purposes. He opined that it was improper to use anabolic steroids in conjunction
with other controlled substances prescribed by Respondent and that the steroids were particularly contraindicated
in light of some of the patients' medical illnesses. The expert found that it was ``medically dangerous'' to give anabolic
steroids to a patient who had experienced prior depression.

Another expert physician testified on behalf of Respondent that the doses of anabolic steroids that Respondent gave
to his patients would be considered therapeutic and modest compared to reported doses used by athletes without a physician's
authorization. This expert acknowledged, however, that although it is ethical to monitor the use of anabolic steroid
use, it is not ethical for physicians to use such substances for the purpose that Respondent used them and that he would
try to dissuade a patient from using anabolic steroids because ``* * * these things are cheating in
the world of sport * * *.'' Moreover, there would be no way to determine if Respondent's patients were
obtaining additional steroids or other illicit drugs on the street. The expert noted that if a physician is providing
anabolic steroids, the physician should weigh the individual and take his blood pressure on every visit. In addition,
the patient's lipid levels, cholesterol and triglycerides should be measured on the first visit to establish a baseline.
Respondent's files demonstrated that, for the most part, this protocol was not followed.

During execution of the search warrant, Respondent confirmed that he dispensed anabolic steroids to his patients
for purposes of body enhancement. He explained that his services were necessary because if he did not provide that
patients with anabolic steroids they would obtain the substances from the illicit market.

On May 30, 1991, in the Contra Costa County Court, State of California, Respondent pled 

nolo contendere

 to and was convicted of six felony counts of issuing controlled substance prescriptions without a legitimate medical
purpose. Respondent was placed on probation and fined.

During execution of the search warrant, samples of various Schedule II through V controlled substances were discovered
in various locations throughout Respondent's office, including Respondent's desk. There were no records of receipts
or dispensing for any of the controlled substance samples as required by Federal law. There was only one completed
DEA 222 order form for fentanyl although Respondent also possessed Demerol, another Schedule II controlled substance.

In evaluating whether Respondent's continued registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator considers the factors
enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are as follows:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00075 </DOCNO>

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.

In determining whether a registrant's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy
Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Deputy
Administrator has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and
circumstances of each case. 

See David E. Trawick, D.D.S., 

Docket No. 88-69, 53 FR 5326 (1988).

The Deputy Administrator concurs with the opinion and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge and finds
that the second, third, fourth and fifth factors apply. Respondent clearly provided controlled substances to addicts
to maintain their customary use. This conclusion is not only supported by Respondent's patient files and the information
provided by Respondent and his employees, it is supported by Respondent's conviction of six felony offenses in the
State of California.

Although Respondent acknowledged his treatment of addicts, he argued that he had no knowledge that he was operating
unlawfully and, in any event, his treatment was effective. The administrative law judge found that it is Respondent's
duty to be aware of all applicable laws and regulations. 

Walter S. Gresham, 

Docket No. 91-39, 57 FR 44213 (1992).

In addition, while there was some testimony from several of Respondent's patients that his drug treatment helped
them, the record, for the most part, belies this contention. Respondent prescribed and dispensed controlled substances
without establishing any medical need other than that the patient was an addict. Even if Respondent were registered
to operate a narcotic treatment program as required by 21 U.S.C. 823(g), the prescribing of narcotics would have been
unlawful pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.07(a).

Moreover, Respondent had little basis initially to verify that his patients were drug addicts other than their word.
He did nothing to ensure that his patients abstained from controlled substances other than those he prescribed and
he took no steps to prevent diversion of the controlled substances he supplied other than raising his price to prevent
diversion for economic gain. Although Respondent contended that he was operating a detoxification program, many
patients had been obtaining controlled substances from Respondent for several years. One patient was arrested for
driving while under the influence of drugs after apparently consuming large amounts of controlled substances prescribed
by Respondent on the previous day. The undercover visits further reinforce the conclusion that Respondent did nothing
to treat his patients' addictions other than supply them with substitute controlled substances. Respondent volunteered
to prescribe controlled substances for the undercover detective without seeking any information about the detective's
alleged drug use or past treatment. Respondent did not offer the undercover detective any counseling and treatment
and the amount of the Restoril prescription was increased on the detective's verbal assurances that he shared the
Restoril with his ``girlfriend'' even though she was not present for this visit.

Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids in violation of applicable state law. Again, Respondent did not deny dispensing
the drugs but maintained that he was unaware that it was illegal and that he dispensed these substances in order to prevent
his patients from obtaining illicit steroids on the street. Respondent's discussion with various state regulatory
and law enforcement officers in 1987 and 1989 contradict this assertion. As was the case with Respondent's use of controlled
substances for drug addicts, he had a duty to know that his conduct regarding steroids was unlawful. In addition to
the above violations, Respondent failed to keep any records of dispensing or receipt of controlled substances located
in his office with the sole exception of one DEA 222 order form.

These violations represent a significant part of Respondent's practice There is nothing in the record to indicate
that Respondent understood the grave consequences of his actions, other than acknowledging that his conduct violated
the law. Rather, Respondent made great efforts to justify much of his unlawful conduct. Indeed, Respondent did not
cease his illegal conduct completely even after the search warrant was served. The MBC Consent Decree in no way detracts
from these findings and conclusions. The Deputy Administrator has considered Respondent's arguments submitted
in his exceptions and finds that the administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law are amply supported
by the record. Under these circumstances, revocation of Respondent's DEA registration is the appropriate remedy
at this time.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AC8638085, previously issued to John W. Copeland, be, and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications for
the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Dellmar Pharmacy 

#

4; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>



On April 8, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), directed an Order to Show Cause to Dellmar Pharmacy 

#

4 (Respondent), proposing to revoke its DEA Certificate of Registration, AD0931407, as a retail pharmacy under 21
U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and to deny any pending applications under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged that
the continued registration of the Respondent would be inconsistent with the public interest.

The Respondent, by counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was docketed
before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in San Antonio,
Texas on October 28, 1993.

On May 27, 1994, Judge Bittner issued her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and
decision in which she recommended that the Respondent's registration be revoked. Respondent filed exceptions to
this opinion, and on June 27, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record of the proceedings to the Deputy
Administrator.

The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, enters his final
order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The administrative law judge found that in 1990, the DEA and the State of Texas began a joint investigation of Respondent
based upon a complaint that a customer was receiving controlled substances without a physician's authorization.
Investigators acquired a patient profile printout of pharmacy records for this customer, and determined from the
listed physician that he had not prescribed the medication indicated. Investigators commenced an audit of the controlled
substances which revealed shortages of Fastin, Dalmane, and flurazepam, all Schedule IV controlled substances.
Investigators then requested a physician profile printout of pharmacy records which revealed that prescriptions
had been filled for several other customers which also were erroneously attributed to this same physician. Subsequently,
Respondent's owner and pharmacist-in-charge, Mr. Jesus Garcia, admitted that he had filled or refilled prescriptions
for a number of customers without a physician's authorization. The audit revealed that Respondent had filled 218
controlled substance prescriptions and refilled 58 others without a physician's authorization.

The administrative law judge found that statements given to investigators by Respondent's customers indicated
that customers were told to call Respondent when they needed anything, and that they would be issued controlled substances
via prescriptions attributed to various doctors and filled under various patient names and addresses. Statements
from the physicians involved revealed that although they may have treated the customers indicated with various courses
of drugs, they often had neither issued these patients prescriptions for the controlled substances, nor did they
authorize the frequency of prescribing attributed to them. These prescriptions included a wide variety of Schedule
III and IV controlled substances.

The administrative law judge found that on May 29, 1991, Mr. Garcia was indicted in Bexar County, Texas, on a charge
of furnishing a fraudulent prescription to a state investigator. Upon his plea of guilty, he was sentenced to four
years deferred adjudication and probation.

The administrative law judge further found that on April 29, 1992, the Texas Pharmacy Board suspended Mr. Garcia's
license for two years, probating all but 90 days of that period, ordered that the pharmacy pay a $3,000 fine, and required
that Mr. Garcia pass a Texas Pharmacy Jurisprudence examination before resuming the practice of pharmacy.

Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following
factors shall be considered:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-2-00063 </PARENT>

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances. 
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. 
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 54 FR 16422 (1989).

Of the stated factors, the administrative law judge found that all were relevant and that there was a statutory basis
for revocation based on findings that Respondent engaged in a definite and clear pattern of furnishing huge quantities
of controlled substances and other prescription medication to customers without physician authorization, and
that Respondent was unable to account for substantial quantities of controlled substances. Respondent offered
as evidence statements made by some of the physicians that they had actually treated some of the customers, and argued
that there was a potential that the physician records failed to reflect authorization of certain prescriptions.
Judge Bittner found this to be speculative and insufficient to counter the overwhelming evidence that Respondent's
behavior was egregious and a total abrogation of its obligations as a DEA registrant. The administrative law judge
concluded that Respondent's continued registration would not be in the public interest.

Respondent filed exceptions to the opinion and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge asserting that
the administrative law judge failed to consider that Mr. Garcia cooperated with authorities in the criminal proceeding
brought against him and, as a result, he was given the least possible punishment. Furthermore, he asserted that the
administrative law judge failed to consider as evidence of future conduct, the fact that Mr. Garcia cooperated fully
with DEA and State officials and Mr. Garcia was in compliance with this probation. Finally, Respondent argued that
it has suffered enough revocation of its DEA registration would be devastating to Mr. Garcia and the low income community
it services.

The Deputy Administrator finds that the administrative law judge has fully considered the facts and circumstances
surrounding Mr. Garcia's guilty plea, which however, were outweighed by the Respondent's recent pattern of fraudulent
activity which led to the diversion of large quantities of controlled substances. The Deputy Administrator adopts
the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of Administrative Law Judge Bittner in its entirety.
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the Respondent's continued registration would
not be in the public interest.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AD0931407, issued to Dellmar Pharmacy 

#

4, be and it hereby is, revoked; and that any pending applications, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective
October 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Abnormal Occurrence Report; Section 208 Report Submitted to the Congress</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as
amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on
abnormal occurrences (NUREG-0090, Vol. 17, No. 1).

Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled
incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.''
NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection
against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences.

The report to Congress is for the first calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events that
the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described.

This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved inoperable main
steam isolation valves at a boiling water reactor, four involved medical brachytherapy misadministrations, one
involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved four lost reference sources. One AO that was
reported by an Agreement State is also discussed; the information is current as of April 25, 1994. This event involved
a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical misadministration. The report also contains updates on seven AOs previously
reported by NRC licensees and one AO previously reported by an Agreement State licensee. For the period January 1 to
March 31, 1994, no new ``Other Events of Interest'' were reported but an update to a previously reported therapeutic
misadministration is included.

A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.
(Lower Level), Washington, D.C. 20555, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout
the country.

Copies of NUREG-0090, Vol. 17, No. 1 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082.
A year's subscription to the NUREG-0090 series publication, which consists of four issues, is also available.

Copies of the report may also be purchased from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,
5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

<DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing






The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. 41, 51, and 74, issued to Arizona Public Services Company for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station (PVNGS), Units 1, 2 and 3, respectively, located in Maricopa County, Arizona.



The proposed amendment would add the analytical method supplement entitled ``Calculative Methods for the CE Large
Break LOCA Evaluation Model for the Analysis of CE and W Designed NSSS,'' CENPD-132, Supplement 3-P-A,
dated June 1985, to the list of analytical methods in TS Section 6.9.1.10 used to determine the PVNGS core operating
limits. Additionally, further administrative changes are proposed to the list of analytical methods.



Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards considerations, which is presented below:






Standard 1_Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?



The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation
of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The proposed change simply adds an
NRC-approved LOCA [loss of coolant accident] evaluation methodology to the list of analytical methods used to determine
core operating limits. The proposed change does not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report] accident analyses. Since the UFSAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological
consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed change. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the proposed change to Section 6.9.1.10 does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.



Standard 2_Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?



The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation
of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Accordingly, no new failure modes
have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been identified
as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change to Section 6.9.1.10 does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



Standard 3_Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?



The proposed change is administrative in nature in that an NRC-approved LOCA evaluation methodology is being added
to the list of analytical methods used to determine core operating limits. Since the core operating limits are still
being established by an NRC-approved methodology and will provide adequate core protection, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.



The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days of
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.



Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and
Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this


Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.



The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By October 6, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene
shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected
by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be
permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the
Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other
interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's
interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which
petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted
as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Company, et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-68 issued to Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation Municipal Electric Authority
of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Unit 1,
located in Burke County, Georgia.

The proposed amendment would eliminate article 2.C(6) and the associated attachment 1 of the license. Article 2.C(6)
references attachment 1 which lists special diesel generator (DG) maintenance and surveillance requirements.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




The change to the license will delete license conditions related to DG component inspections that were imposed based
on the recommendations in NUREG-1216. Therefore, the detailed steps of preventive maintenance surveillance
programs will become subject to the same degree of NRC staff review and approval as for DGs provided by other manufacturers.
However, future revisions of the maintenance surveillance program are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59.
The owners group in conjunction with the DG manufacturer is developing a generic DG management program. The transition
from the current program to the generic program will be accomplished under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59.

The requirements imposed by attachment 1 to the license were in addition to the Technical Specifications surveillance
and maintenance requirements for DGs in nuclear service. The requirements of attachment 1 were imposed due to the
unresolved concerns about the reliability of TDI DGs that existed at the time of issuance of the VEGP Unit 1 license.
Since that time the concerns have been resolved by substantial operational data and inspection results which have
demonstrated that these DGs may be treated on a par with other DGs within the nuclear industry and subjected to the same
standard regulations without the special requirements of NUREG-1216. The proposed change will result in continuing
DG performance in accordance with NRC requirements for this function, and it is likely to result in improved availability.
The current Technical Specification surveillance requirements will continue to assure that the DGs are proven at
regular intervals to perform in accordance with NRC requirements. These license conditions have been technically
justified on the basis of current reliability data and inspection results of operating TDI DGs throughout the last
several years. The NRC staff has agreed with these conclusions as documented in the SER for the topical report.

The current DG maintenance and surveillance program for the VEGP DGs is in agreement with the applicable portions
of the surveillance and maintenance programs described in the topical report and with the requirements of the Technical
Specifications. Any subsequent changes to the surveillance and maintenance requirements currently contained
in attachment 1 to the license following the removal of the attachment from the Operating License will be made in accordance
with 10 CFR 50.59.

Based on the above considerations, GPC has concluded the following concerning 10 CFR 50.92.

1. The proposed change to the license does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated because the availability and reliability of the DGs will remain within the limits
previously assumed in the safety analyses.

2. The proposed change to the license does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
accident previously evaluated because it does not result in any physical changes to the plant or in its modes of operation
and the DGs have been demonstrated to operate at a level of reliability that is consistent with that which was previously
determined to be acceptable for this application.
 
3. The proposed deletion from the license does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the
results of the operational data and inspection reports have demonstrated that the license conditions are not required
to assure that the DGs will be maintained in a state of reliability consistent with that assumed for the safety analyses.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis in conjunction with its cover letter, and, based on this review,
it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which
petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted
as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Request for Extension of Approval of Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Form 5500 Series_Annual
Report of Employee Benefit Plans</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for OMB extension of approval.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested that the Office of Management and Budget approve an extension
of the expiration date of a currently approved information collection (1212-0026) without any change in the
substance or in the method of collection. Current approval expires on October 31, 1994. The information collection
is contained in the IRS/DOL/PBGC Form 5500 series. These forms are used by pension plan administrators to fulfill
the requirements under section 4065 of ERISA and 29 CFR Part 2611 that an annual report be filed with the PBGC. The effect
of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request for OMB approval of this extension.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) establishes policies and procedures for controlling the
paperwork burdens imposed by Federal agencies on the public. The Act vests the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
with regulatory responsibility over these burdens, and OMB has promulgated rules on the clearance of collections
of information by Federal agencies (5 CFR Part 1320).




Section 4065 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1365) and 29 CFR Part 2611 require
the administrator of a defined benefit pension plan to file an annual report with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(PBGC) in order that PBGC may monitor the plan's yearly operations insofar as they relate to the termination insurance
program under Title IV of ERISA. Other provisions in ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (29 U.S.C. 1021(b) (4) and
26 U.S.C. 6058) require that annual reports be filed by administrators of employee benefit plans (including defined
benefit pension plans) with the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for similar monitoring
with respect to the ERISA requirements within their respective jurisdictions. DOL, IRS, and PBGC have established
joint forms (the Form 5500 series) to be used for those annual reports.


When the appropriate form in the 5500 series is filed with the IRS, the filing requirement for each of the three agencies
is satisfied; each agency utilizes the information applicable to it. In addition to general identifying information,
the PBGC uses the coverage information reported on Form 5500 or Form 5500-C/R, and the actuarial information
on Schedule B attached to the form, to fulfill its monitoring role.


OMB has previously approved the PBGC's collection of information contained in the Form 5500 series; PBGC is requesting
an extension of that approval without any change in the substance or method of collection. The PBGC estimates that
it will receive 106,407 reports annually, that the response to the portion of the forms allocated to the PBGC will take
an average of .21 hours, and that the annual burden imposed by this information collection is 25,379 hours.





Issued at Washington, DC, this 26th day of August, 1994.

 Notice of request for OMB approval. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') has requested that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'')
extend approval, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of the collection of information requirements in its rules for
the administration of multiemployer plans that have terminated by mass withdrawal (OMB control number 1212-0032;
expires September 30, 1994). These rules include requirements for notices and applications submitted to the PBGC.
The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the PBGC's request and solicit public comment on this collection
of information.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 

et seq.

). Part 2675 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2675), Powers and Duties of Plan Sponsor of Plan Terminated by Mass
Withdrawal, implements requirements of ERISA sections 4041A and 4281 (29 U.S.C. 1341A and 1441) for the administration
of multiemployer plans that have terminated by mass withdrawal. 


Under section 4041A, which governs the payment of benefits under such plans, the PBGC may authorize the payment of
benefits in amounts or forms not otherwise permitted, and the plan sponsor must reduce benefits and suspend benefit
payments in accordance with section 4281. 
Under section 4281, if the annual valuation of such a plan shows that plan assets are not sufficient to satisfy all nonforfeitable
benefits under the plan, the plan sponsor must amend the plan to eliminate benefits that are not eligible for the PBGC's
guarantee to the extent necessary to ensure that plan assets are sufficient (as determined and certified in accordance
with PBGC regulations) for all nonforfeitable benefits. If, after a plan has been so amended, the plan becomes insolvent
(

i.e.,

 unable to pay benefits when due for a plan year), the plan sponsor must suspend benefits in excess of guaranteed benefits
to the extent that their payment cannot be supported by the plan's available resources. In addition, if the plan's
available resources are inadequate to pay guaranteed benefits, the plan sponsor must request financial assistance
from the PBGC (see also ERISA sections 4245(f) and 4261 (29 U.S.C. 1426 and 1431)). 
To assure the consistency and adequate quality of required submissions, Part 2675 includes rules for notices of the
adoption of a plan amendment reducing benefits and of any restoration of benefits (  2675.23 and 2675.24),
notices that a plan is, or will be, insolvent and annual updates (  2675.34 and 2765.35), notices of insolvency
benefit level (  2675.36 and 2675.37), and applications for financial assistance if a plan is, or will
be, unable to pay guaranteed benefits when due (  2675.16 and 2675.38). Part 2675 also provides for the
submission of an application for PBGC approval to pay benefits not otherwise permitted ( 2675.17). The PBGC
uses the information submitted in making statutory determinations and in identifying and estimating cash needs
for financial assistance. 
The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of this collection of information
(OMB control number 1212-0032; expires September 30, 1994) for another three years. The PBGC estimates the
total annual burden of these requirements at 427 hours: 10 hours for notices of insolvency and 8 hours for benefit reduction
notices with respect to two plans; 4 hours for an application to pay benefits not otherwise permitted under one plan;
and 36 hours for annual updates, 45 hours for notices of insolvency benefit level, and 324 hours for applications for
financial assistance with respect to nine plans. (The PBGC expects to receive benefit restoration notices so infrequently
that the number per year is assumed to be zero.) These estimates are averages that, among other things, take into account
PBGC assumptions about increases in the number of insolvent plans over time.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corporation and Midwest Securities Trust Company; Order Approving
Proposed Rule Changes Relating to Corporate Governance 


August 26, 1994. 


On June 23, 1994, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') and the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'')
submitted proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-94-07 and SR-MSTC-94-09)
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposals appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 29, 1994, to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposals. 





I. Description of the Proposal 


The purpose of the proposed rule changes is to change MCC's and MSTC's By-laws to correspond to changes that are being
made simultaneously to the Constitution of the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CHX''), the parent corporation
of MCC and MSTC.
 Once all the changes are approved and implemented, the boards of directors of MSTC and MCC and the board of governors
of the CHX will consist of the same individuals. The changes are being made in order to achieve a governance structure
where CHX, MCC, and MSTC will operate more as a single business entity. 





In order to ensure fair and meaningful representation of MCC's and MSTC's participants in the governance process,
the size of the complex's board is being increased to thirty-one to accommodate, among other things, a new category
of board member, called participant governors, to provide the board with expertise on issuances affecting MCC and
MSTC.
 The four participant governor positions must be filled by general partners or officers of a participant in MCC or MSTC
and must have securities clearance and settlement expertise, background, or responsibilities. In addition, there
will be one position added to the board which must be filled by a person who is not a CHX member. 




In order to implement the purpose of the rule changes, MCC is amending Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.3 of its By-laws
to change the number of directors from twenty-six to thirty-one and to require the nominating committee to select
candidates with a view towards providing fair representation not only for the interests of a cross-section of MCC's
participations but also for the interests of the CHX. MCC is amending Article 4A.1 to provide that the composition
of MCC's nominating committee will be the same as that of CHX's nominating committee. MCC is amending Article 5, Sections
5.1 and 5.3 to empower the chairman instead of the board of directors to appoint and remove all officers and agents.
MSTC is amending Article II, Sections 1 and 2 of its By-laws to provide for more flexibility in the timing of the annual
meeting and to add the chairman as one who can call special meetings of the shareholders. MSTC is amending Article III,
Section 2 to change the number of directors from eighteen to thirty-one, to change from sixty to thirty-one the minimum
number of days before each annual shareholder meeting that the nominating committee must submit nominations to the
board, to require ten participants signatures instead of three to nominate persons for the board in addition to those
nominated by the nominating committee, and to require the nominating committee to elect candidates with a view towards
providing fair representation not only for the interests of a cross section of MSTC participants but also for the interests
of CHX. MSTC is amending Section 8 to provide that any vacancy on the board shall be filled by a majority of the directors
then in office instead of by election at the annual meeting or special meeting by shareholders. MSTC also is amending
Article IV, Section 4 to provide that the nominating committee of MSTC will be composed of the same members as the 
CHX's nominating committee and is amending Article 5, Sections 1, 2, and 5 to empower the chairman instead of the board
of directors to appoint and dismiss all officers and agents.

<PARENT> FR940906-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, the changes to MCC's and MSTC's By-laws will make the president and chief executive officer (``CEO'')
of CHX the chairman of the MCC and MSTC boards ex-officio and an ex-officio member of the boards with the right to vote.
Also, the presidents of MSTC and MCC will be the CEOs of MSTC and MCC, respectively but will not be board members ex-officio.
The vice-chairmen of MCC and MSTC will be ex-officio members of the boards of MCC and MSTC, respectively, with the right
to vote. 


II. Discussion


The Commission believes the proposals are consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act.
 Sections 17A(b)(3)(C) require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure a fair representation of its
members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs.






The Commission states in the order granting MCC and MSTC registration as clearing agencies that at a minimum, fair
representation requires that the entity responsible for nominating individuals for membership on a clearing agency's
board of directors should be obligated by By-law or Rule to make nominations with a view toward assuring fair representation
of the interests of shareholders and of a cross section of the community of participants.
 Under MCC's and MSTC's corporate governance structures, CHX, as the sole shareholder of MCC and MSTC, retained the
sole vote for MCC's and MSTC's boards of directors. In order to satisfy the minimum fair representation requirement,
MCC and MSTC established separate nominating committees comprised of their participants to nominate individuals
for membership on their board of directors. 




Under the revised By-laws, CHX will continue to have the sole vote for members of the complex's board. To provide the
necessary framework of fair representation for their participants, the combined CHX/MCC/MSTC nominating committees
are required to select candidates with a view towards providing fair representation for CHX, the sole shareholder
of MCC and MSTC, and fair representation of a cross section of participants. To further ensure the fair representation
of MCC and MSTC participants, CHX's rule change establishes four participant governor slots which must be filled
by MCC and MSTC members and requires that individuals nominated to serve as participant governors have expertise
on issues affecting MCC and MSTC.
To assist the Commission in its assessment of any long term effects the corporate governance restructing might have
on the fair representation of MCC and MSTC participants in the selection of the complex's board, MCC and MSTC will provide
to the Commission after the first election under the new corporate governance structure a list of the governors of
the complex's board. The list will set forth the board slot each governor is filling (

e.g.

, participant governor, floor governor, upstairs governor) and a list of the complex entities (

e.g.

, CHX, MCC, and MSTC) to which each governor is a member. MCC and MSTC will submit such a report after each annual shareholders
meeting and after any change in the composition of the complex's board for the next five years.
The rule changes also should facilitate the three entities ability to operate as a single business entity and thereby
should promote efficiency in the management of the complex. As a result of the above restructuring, the clearance
and settlement and depository processes should benefit from greater coordination among CHX, MCC, and MSTC. In addition
to having a unified board and nominating committee, cooperation and coordination will be advanced by having, among
other things, the president and CEO of CHX serve on the MCC and MSTC boards as the chairman ex-officio and as an ex-officio
with the right to vote.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly with Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-MCC-94-07 and SR-MSTC-94-09)
be, and hereby are, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Depository Eligibility of New Issue Municipal Securities </DOCTITLE>


August 26, 1994. 


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on August 17, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared primarily by MSRB. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 


The proposed rule change will amend MSRB Rule G-34 on CUSIP Numbers and Dissemination of Initial Trade Date Information
concerning depository eligibility of new issue municipal securities. MSRB requests that the Commission delay the
effectiveness of the proposed rule change until sixty (60) days after Commission approval to allow dealers to adjust
their underwriting procedures to obtain compliance. 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSRB included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The texts of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSRB has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements. 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6-1 under the Act, which establishes three business days
after the trade date (``T+3'') instead of five business days (``T+5'') as the standard settlement timeframe for most
broker-dealer transactions.
 The rule becomes effective June 1, 1995. Although municipal securities were not included within the scope of Rule
15c6-1, the Commission did request that MSRB provide a plan for implementing T+3 settlement in the municipal
securities market.
 In response, MSRB submitted to the Commission its Report of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on T+3 Settlement
for the Municipal Securities Market (March 17, 1994) (``T+3 Report''). The T+3 Report detailed changes in operational
practices and regulatory actions that would be necessary in a T+3 environment for municipal securities. 





The T+3 Report discussed the need for changes concerning the use of physical securities certificates to settle interdealer
and institutional customer transactions. Because these transactions are settled on a delivery vs. payment or receipt
vs. payment (``DVP/RVP'') basis, it is critical that the delivery of securities be made in a timely manner on settlement
date. The physical delivery of securities certificates, however, is a relatively time-consuming and inefficient
practice as compared to book-entry delivery through a securities depository. A shortened settlement cycle will
provide dealers, institutional customers, and their clearing agents with considerably less time to deal with the
processing requirements and inevitable problems that arise in connection with transportation, delivery, and acceptance
of physical securities certificates. 
In 1993, MSRB amended MSRB Rules G-12(f)(ii) and G-15(d)(iii) to require essentially all interdealer
and institutional customer transactions to be settled by book-entry when the securities involved in the transactions
are listed as eligible for deposit in a depository. While these rules have assisted the municipal securities industry
in moving toward more universal use of book-entry settlement, the rules only apply to transactions in securities
that are depository-eligible. 
The proposed rule change will facilitate book-entry settlement of transactions in municipal securities by requiring,
with limited exceptions, dealers acquiring new issue municipal securities to apply for depository eligibility.
This requirement will serve to ensure that the great majority of new issue municipal securities are made depository
eligible. As a result, the number of interdealer and institutional customer transactions that must be settled by
book-entry under MSRB Rules G-12(f)(ii) and G-15(d)(iii) will greatly increase. This will facilitate
the conversion to T+3 settlement and will enhance the efficiency of clearance and settlement of municipal securities
by reducing the number of physical deliveries of interdealer and institutional customer transactions in favor of
book-entry settlement. 
Under the proposed rule change, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers will be required to apply for
depository eligibility within one business day of the date of sale of a new issue municipal security.
 The proposed rule change will exempt (1) issues not meeting the eligibility criteria of all depositories that accept
municipal securities for deposit and (2) issues maturing in sixty days or less. The proposed rule change also will
provide an exemption until July 1, 1996, for issues under $1 million in par value. MSRB has adopted the rule change pursuant
to Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that MSRB has the authority to adopt rules:



To foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.***

As noted above, MSRB believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate clearance and settlement of municipal
securities and, therefore, is consistent with the provisions of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


In March 1994, MSRB requested comment on a draft amendment to Rule G-34 that would require dealers to apply for
depository eligibility of all new issue municipal securities. The draft amendment included exemptions for issues
not meeting the criteria set by depositories for eligibility and for new issues under $1 million in par value. MSRB
received ten comment letters in response to the draft amendments.
 The comments were generally supportive; however, some commenters suggested modifications to the draft amendments.

The Ten-day Application Period


The draft amendment would have required dealers to apply to a depository at least ten days prior to the closing date
of a new issue to establish depository eligibility. This provision was intended to support the routine practice recommended
by depositories even though depositories can and do make new issues eligible on shorter notice when it is necessary.
A majority of commenters, however, believe that the ten day application period is inappropriate for an MSRB rule in
light of the need of underwriters occasionally to settle a new issue with an issuer on short notice. Three commenters
proposed a different approach that would tie the application requirement to the date of sale rather than the date of
closing. These commenters suggested that the provision be changed to require the application to be made within twenty-four
hours of the award of the issue.
MSRB notes that this suggestion will avoid potential problems that might occur in the occasional cases in which there
is less than ten days between the date of award of a competitively sold issue and the settlement of the issue. At the same
time, the requirement for underwriters to apply to a depository on the day after the date of sale gives depositories
the maximum amount of time available to establish eligibility and prepare for a book-entry distribution. Therefore,
MSRB has included in the proposed rule change a provision requiring that the application to a depository must be made
within one business day of the date of sale of the issue. The proposed rule change also includes a requirement that if
the full documentation and information required to establish depository eligibility is not available from the underwriter
at the time the initial application is submitted to the depository, the underwriter shall forward such documentation
to the depository as soon as it is available.


Exemption Until July 1, 1996, for Issues Under $1 Million in Par Value


The draft amendment included exemptive language for issues under $1 million in par value. This exemption was included
because of concerns that had been expressed by some dealers relating to their desire to continue to use physical settlements
for small issues with limited distribution. Eight commenters urged MSRB to include issues under $1 million in par
value within the rule with most citing the need for increased settlement efficiencies offered by book-entry when
T+3 becomes effective. Two commenters suggested a temporary exemption for small issues and noted that ultimately
all issues should be included within the scope of the rule but that some underwriters of small issues may need time to
adjust their procedures associated with clearance and settlement of small issues. MSRB believes that this is a reasonable
approach and has adopted a provision in the proposed rule change that will exempt issues under $1 million in par value
until July 1, 1996.
Four commenters suggested that a reduction in depository application fees would reduce the need for an exemption
for small issues. MSRB, however, has no authority to change the fees charged by depositories.


Exemption for Issues Maturing in Sixty Days or Less


Three commenters suggested an exemption for issues maturing in sixty days or less and noted that these issues typically
do not trade in the secondary market. MSRB is not aware of any substantial trading in such short-term securities and
agrees that an exemption for issues maturing in sixty days or less would be appropriate. The exemption accordingly
has been included within the proposed rule change.


Other Suggested Exemptions


One commenter suggested exempting leases, notes, and bonds sold to nondepository participants. MSRB is not aware
of any reason that these types of securities should be treated differently than other municipal securities. It accordingly
has not provided exemptions for these types of issues in the proposed rule change.


Depository Eligibility Criteria


MSRB understands that of the three depositories accepting municipal securities for deposit, the eligibility criteria
is essentially the same and that nearly all municipal securities meet the criteria for depository eligibility. If,
however, an issue could not be made eligible at any of these depositories, the proposed rule change will not require
the underwriter to make an application.
 One commenter urged that depositories reach agreement on uniform minimum guidelines to minimize the burden on underwriters
and inefficiencies that might be caused by any differing eligibility criteria among the depositories., While MSRB
agrees with this goal, MSRB does not have regulatory authority over depositories. MSRB will continue to monitor any
problems created by differing eligibility criteria and may suggest remedial actions to the Commission in the future
if differing eligibility criteria create problems under the proposed rule change.




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so filing or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) by order approve such proposed rule change or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.
MSRB requests that the Commission delay effectiveness of the proposed rule change until sixty days after Commission
approval to allow dealers to adjust their underwriting procedures to obtain compliance.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested people are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. People making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at MSRB's principal offices. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSRB-94-13
and should be submitted by September 27, 1994.

Privacy Act of 1974 DOT/ALL 11 Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) System of Records




The Department of Transportation (DOT) herewith publishes a notice of proposal to replace the DOT/FAA 806, Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) Employee Payable System and DOT/OST 034, Personnel Records systems of records with
DOT/ALL 11 Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) system of records. The proposed system does not duplicate
any existing agency or government-wide systems of records.

M-39, ATTN: Mr. Carl Creager, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Comments to be considered must be
received by October 5, 1994.


If no comments are received, the proposed changes will become effective 40 days from the date of issuance. If comments

Narrative Statement for the Department of Transportation, Office of the Secretary




The Office of the Secretary of Transportation proposes to replace two systems of records, DOT/FAA 806, Federal Aviation
Administration Employee Payable System and DOT/OST 034, Personnel Records with DOT/ALL 11 Integrated Personnel
and Payroll System (IPPS) system of records.


The purpose of this Notice is to update and align DOT's payroll and personnel systems of records with the IPPS personnel
and payroll integrated database. The IPPS database is a product of IPPS, an integrated personnel and payroll management
information system currently under development. The first phase of the system will begin in August 1994. The possibility
of adverse effects of this proposal concerning privacy interests of the general public is minimal as the new system
combines the information currently held in DOT/FAA 806 and DOT/OST 034 systems of record. A description of the steps
taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the 

Federal Register

 system of records. The changes include amendments to: System number, system name, security classification, system
location, categories of individuals covered by the system, categories of records in the system, authority for maintenance
of the system, routine uses of records maintained in the system including categories of users and the purposes of such
uses, disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining,
and disposing of records in the system, retrievability, safeguards, retention and disposal, systems managers and
address, notification procedure, record access procedures, contesting record procedures, record source categories.
The authority for maintenance of the system is 5 U.S.C. 2957 and 5 U.S.C. 2954. The purpose of this report is to comply
with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-130, Appendix I, dated July 15, 1994.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS




Notice of Vote to Close Meeting




At its meeting on August 29, 1994, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously to close
to public observation its meeting scheduled for October 3, 1994, in Seattle, Washington. The members will consider
requests for 1) expense funding for credit/debit cards, and 2) capital funding for Multiline Optical Character Readers
(MLOCRs).
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, Setrakian and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary
to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(4) and (9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3
(d) and (i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement
of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose under item 1) information
that is proprietary or confidential to national credit card vendors; and under item 2) information, the premature
disclosure of which would significantly frustrate proposed procurement actions.
The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be
open to the public.
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(4) and (9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code;
and section 7.3 (d) and (i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202)
268-4800.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency gives notice and invites comments on a proposed revision to the Federal Radiological
Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) to update and supersede the original FRERP. The FRERP establishes an organized,
integrated capability for participating Federal agencies to respond to a wide range of peacetime radiological emergencies.
The FRERP provides a concept of operations, outlines Federal policies and planning considerations, and specifies
authorities and responsibilities of each Federal agency that has a significant role in such emergencies.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 304 of Public Law 96-295, requires that the President prepare and publish a plan to provide for expeditious,
efficient, and coordinated Federal response to accidents at nuclear power facilities. Executive Order (E.O.) 12241
(September 29, 1980) delegated this responsibility to the Director, FEMA. FEMA published the first FRERP on November
8, 1985, 50 FR 46542. 




This proposed revision to the FRERP is essential to update the original plan, and to take into account new laws, regulations,
and changed operating conditions. Seventeen Federal departments and agencies on the Subcommittee on Federal Response
of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee prepared this proposed revision. Each of the 17
departments and agencies has roles and responsibilities involving response to peacetime radiological emergencies.
The concept of operations described in the FRERP is based on specific authorities for responding to radiological
emergencies. 


Federal agencies respond to radiological emergencies using the FRERP, each 
agency in accordance with its existing statutory authorities and funding resources. The Lead Federal Agency has
responsibility for coordination of the overall Federal response to the emergency. FEMA is responsible for coordinating
non-radiological support using the structure of the Federal Response Plan. The relationship between the two plans,
which is discussed in the proposed FRERP, will be further described in an Annex to the Federal Response Plan.

I. Introduction and Background 



A. Introduction 



The objective of the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) 
is to establish an organized and integrated capability for timely, coordinated response by Federal agencies to peacetime
radiological emergencies. 

The FRERP: 

(1) Provides the Federal Government's concept of operations based on 
specific authorities for responding to radiological emergencies; 

(2) Outlines Federal policies and planning considerations on which the 
concept of operations of this Plan and Federal agency specific response plans are based; and 

(3) Specifies authorities and responsibilities of each Federal agency that may have a significant role in such emergencies.


There are two Sections in this Plan. Section I contains background, 
considerations, and scope. Section II describes the concept of operations for response. 



B. Participating Federal Agencies 



Each participating agency has responsibilities and/or capabilities that pertain to various types of radiological
emergencies. The following Federal agencies participate in the FRERP: 

(1) Department of Agriculture (USDA), 

(2) Department of Commerce (DOC), 

(3) Department of Defense (DOD), 

(4) Department of Energy (DOE), 

(5) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 

(6) Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 

(7) Department of the Interior (DOI), 

(8) Department of Justice (DOJ), 

(9) Department of State (DOS), 

(10) Department of Transportation (DOT), 

(11) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 

(12) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 

(13) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 

(14) General Services Administration (GSA), 

(15) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 

(16) National Communications System (NCS), and 

(17) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 



C. Scope 



The FRERP covers any peacetime radiological emergency that has actual, 
potential, or perceived radiological consequences within the United States, its Territories, possessions, or
territorial waters and that could require a response by several Federal agencies. The level of the Federal response
to a specific emergency will be based on the type and/or amount of radioactive material involved, the location of the
emergency, the impact on or the potential for impact on the public and environment, and the size of the affected area.
Emergencies occurring at fixed nuclear facilities or during the transportation of radioactive materials, including
nuclear weapons, fall within the scope of the Plan regardless of whether the facility or 
radioactive materials are publicly or privately owned, Federally regulated, regulated by an Agreement State, or
not regulated at all. (Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [Subsection 274.b.], the NRC has relinquished to certain
States its regulatory authority for licensing the use of source, byproduct, and small quantities of special nuclear
material.) 



D. Plan Considerations 



1. Public and Private Sector Response 



For an emergency at a fixed nuclear facility or a facility not under the control of a Federal agency, State and local
governments have primary responsibility for determining and implementing measures to protect life, property,
and the environment in areas outside the facility boundaries. The owner or operator of a nuclear facility has primary
responsibility for actions within the boundaries of that facility, for providing notification and advice to offsite
officials, and for minimizing the radiological hazard to the public. 

For emergencies involving an area under Federal control, the responsibility for onsite actions belongs to a Federal
agency, while offsite actions are the responsibility of the State or local government. 

For all other emergencies, the State or local government has the responsibility for taking emergency actions both
onsite and offsite, with support provided, upon request, by Federal agencies as designated in Section II of this plan.

2. Coordination by Federal Agencies 



This Plan describes how the Federal response to a radiological 
emergency will be organized. It includes guidelines for notification of Federal agencies and States, coordination
and leadership of Federal response activities onscene, and coordination of Federal public information activities
and Congressional relations by Federal agencies. The Plan suggests ways in which the State, local, and Federal agencies
can most effectively integrate their actions. The degree to which the Federal response is merged or to which activities
are adjusted will be based upon the requirements and priorities set by the State. 

Appropriate independent emergency actions may be taken by the participating Federal agencies within the limits
of their own statutory authority to protect the public, minimize immediate hazards, and gather information about
the emergency that might be lost by delay. 



3. Federal Agency Authorities 



Some Federal agencies have authority to respond to certain situations affecting public health and safety with or
without a State request. Appendix C of this Plan cites relevant legislative and executive authorities. This Plan
does not create any new authorities nor change any existing ones. 

A response to radiological emergencies on or affecting Federal lands not 
occupied by a government agency should be coordinated with the agency responsible for managing that land to ensure
that response activities are consistent with Federal statutes governing the use and occupancy of these lands. This
coordination is necessary in the case of Indian tribal lands because Federally recognized Indian tribes have a special
relationship with the U.S. Government, and the State and local governments may have limited or no authority on their
reservations. 

In the event of an offsite radiological accident involving a nuclear weapon, special nuclear material, and/or classified
components, the owner (either DOD, DOE, or NASA) will declare a National Defense Area (NDA) or National Security Area
(NSA), respectively, and this area will become ``onsite'' for the purposes of this plan. NDAs and NSAs are established
to safeguard classified information and/or restricted data or equipment and material. Establishment of these areas
places non-Federal lands under Federal control and results only from an emergency event. It is possible that radioactive
contamination would extend beyond the boundaries of these areas. 

In accordance with appropriate national security classification directives, information may be classified concerning
nuclear weapons, special nuclear materials at reactors, and certain fuel cycle facilities producing military fuel.




4. Federal Agency Resource Commitments 



Agencies committing resources under this Plan do so with the understanding 
that the duration of the commitment will depend on the nature and extent of the emergency and the State and local resources
available. Should another emergency occur that is more serious or of higher priority (such as one that may jeopardize
national security), Federal agencies will reassess resources committed under this Plan. 



5. Requests for Federal Assistance 



State and local government requests for assistance, as well as those from 
owners and operators of radiological facilities or activities, may be made directly to the Federal agencies listed
in Table II-1, FEMA, or to other Federal agencies with whom they have preexisting arrangements or relationships.




6. Reimbursement 



The cost of each Federal agency's participation in support of the FRERP is the responsibility of that agency, unless
other agreements or reimbursement mechanisms exist. GSA will be reimbursed for supplies and services provided under
this Plan in accordance with prior interagency agreements. 



E. Training and Exercises 



Federal agencies, in conjunction with State and local governments, will 
periodically exercise the FRERP. Each agency will coordinate its exercises with the Federal Radiological Preparedness
Coordinating Committee's (FRPCC's) 
Subcommittee on Federal Response to avoid duplication and to invite participation by other Federal agencies. 

Federal agencies will assist other Federal agencies and State and local 
governments with planning and training activities designed to improve response 
capabilities. Each agency should coordinate its training programs with the FRPCC's Subcommittee on Training to
avoid duplication and to make its training available to other agencies.

F. Relationship to the Federal Response Plan (FRP) 



1. Without a Stafford Act Declaration 



Federal agencies will respond to radiological emergencies using the FRERP, 
each agency in accordance with existing statutory and funding resources. The LFA has responsibility for coordination
of the overall Federal response to the emergency. FEMA is responsible for coordinating non-radiological support
using the structure of the Federal Response Plan (FRP). 



2. With a Stafford Act Declaration 



When a Stafford Act Declaration has activated the FRP and an associated radiological emergency exists, the functions
and responsibilities of the FRERP remain the same. The LFA coordinates the management of the radiological response
with the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO). Although the direction of the radiological response remains with the
LFA, the FCO has the overall responsibility for coordination of Federal response in support of State and local governments
under the FRP. 



G. Authorities 



The following authorities are the basis for the development of this Plan: 

(1) Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appropriation Authorization, Public Law 96-295, June 30, 1980, sec. 304.
This authorization requires the President to prepare and publish a ``National Contingency Plan'' (subsequently
renamed the FRERP) to provide for expeditious, efficient, and coordinated action by appropriate Federal agencies
to protect the public health and safety in case of accidents at commercial nuclear power plants. 

(2) Executive Order (E.O.) 12241, National Contingency Plan, September 29, 1980. This E.O. delegates to the Director
of FEMA the responsibility for publishing the National Contingency Plan (i.e., the FRERP) for accidents at nuclear
power facilities and requires that it be published from time to time in the 

Federal Register

. 

Authorities for the activities of individual Federal agencies appear in 
Appendix C. 



II. Concept of Operations 



A. Introduction 



The concept of operations for a response provides for the designation of one agency as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA)
and for the establishment of onscene, interagency response centers. The FRERP describes both the responsibilities
of the LFA and other Federal agencies that may be involved and the functions of each of the onscene centers. 

The concept of operations recognizes the preeminent role of State and local governments for determining and implementing
any measures to protect life, property, and the environment in areas not under the control of a Federal agency. 



B. Determination of Lead Federal Agency (LFA) 



The agency which is responsible for leading and coordinating all aspects of the Federal response is referred to as
the LFA and is determined by the type of emergency. In situations where a Federal agency owns, authorizes, regulates,
or is otherwise deemed responsible for the facility or radiological activity causing the emergency and has authority
to conduct and manage Federal actions onsite, that agency normally will be the LFA. 

The following identifies the LFA for each specified type of radiological 
emergency. 



1. Nuclear Facility 





a. Licensed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an Agreement State.

 The NRC is the LFA for an emergency that occurs at a fixed facility or regarding an activity licensed by the NRC or an Agreement
State. These include, but are not limited to, commercial nuclear power reactors, fuel cycle facilities, gaseous
diffusion facilities, and radiopharmaceutical manufacturers. 



b. Owned or Operated by DOD or DOE.

 The LFA is either DOD or DOE, depending on which agency owns or authorizes operation of the facility. These emergencies
may involve reactor operations, nuclear material and weapons production, radioactive material from nuclear weapons,
or other radiological activities. 



c. Not Licensed, Owned, or Operated by a Federal Agency or an Agreement State.

 The EPA is the LFA for an emergency that occurs at a facility not licensed, owned, or operated by a Federal agency or an
Agreement State. These include facilities that possess, handle, store, or process radium or accelerator-produced
radioactive materials. 



2. Transportation of Radioactive Materials 





a. Shipment of Materials Licensed by NRC or an Agreement State.

 The NRC is the LFA for an emergency that involves radiological material licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00112 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



b. Materials Shipped by or for DOD or DOE.

 The LFA is either DOD or DOE depending on which of these agencies has custody of the material at the time of the accident.




c. Shipment of Materials Not Licensed or Owned by a Federal Agency or an 
Agreement State.

 The EPA is the LFA for an emergency that involves radiological material not licensed or owned by a Federal agency or
an Agreement State. 



3. Domestic Satellites Containing Radioactive Materials 



NASA is the LFA for NASA spacecraft missions. DOD is the LFA for DOD spacecraft missions. DOE and EPA provide technical
assistance to DOD and NASA. 



4. Impact From Foreign or Unknown Source 



The EPA is the LFA for an emergency that involves radioactive material from a foreign or unknown source that has actual,
potential, or perceived radiological consequences in the United States, its Territories, possessions, or territorial
waters. The foreign or unknown source may be a reactor (e.g., Chernobyl), a spacecraft containing radioactive material,
radioactive fallout from atmospheric testing of nuclear devices, imported radioactively contaminated material,
or a shipment of foreign-owned radioactive material. Unknown sources of radioactive material refers to that material
whose origin and/or radiological nature is not yet established. These types of sources include contaminated scrap
metal or abandoned radioactive material. DOD, DOE, NASA, and NRC provide technical assistance to EPA. 

In the event of an emergency involving a joint U.S. Government and foreign government spacecraft venture containing
radioactive sources and/or classified components, the LFA will be DOD or NASA, as appropriate. A joint U.S./foreign
venture is defined as an activity in which the U.S. Government has an ongoing interest in the successful completion
of the mission and is intimately involved in mission operations. A joint venture is not created by simply selling or
supplying material to a foreign country for use in their spacecraft. DOE and EPA will provide technical support and
assistance to the LFA. 



5. Other Types of Emergencies 



In the event of an unforeseen type of emergency not specifically described in this Plan or a situation where conditions
exist involving overlapping responsibility that could cause confusion regarding LFA role and responsibilities,
DOD, DOE, EPA, NASA, and NRC will confer upon receipt of notification of the emergency to determine which agency is
the LFA.

C. Radiological Sabotage and Terrorism


Sabotage and terrorism are not treated as separate types of emergencies; rather, they are considered a complicating
dimension of the types listed in Table II-1. For fixed facilities and materials in transit, responses to radiological
emergencies generally do not depend on the initiating event. The coordinated response to contain or mitigate a threatened
or actual release of radioactive material would be essentially the same whether it resulted from an accidental or
deliberate act. For malevolent acts involving improvised nuclear or radiation dispersal devices, the response
is further complicated by the magnitude of the threat and the need for specialized technical expertise/actions.
The Atomic Energy Act directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate all alleged or suspected criminal
violations of the Act. Additionally, the FBI is legally responsible for locating any nuclear weapon, device, or material
and for restoring nuclear facilities to their rightful custodians. In view of its unique responsibilities under
the Atomic Energy Act (amended by the Energy Reorganization Act), the FBI has concluded formal agreements with the
LFAs that provide for interface, coordination, and technical assistance in support of the FBI's mission.
It would be difficult to outline all the possible scenarios arising from criminal or terrorist activity. As a result,
the Federal response will be tailored to the specific circumstances of the event at hand. Generally, for fixed facilities
and materials in transit, the designated LFA and supporting agencies will perform the functions delineated in this
plan and provide technical support and assistance to the FBI in the performance of its mission. For those emergencies
where an LFA is not specifically designated (e.g., improvised nuclear device), the Federal response will be guided
by the established interagency agreements and contingency plans. In accordance with these agreements and plans,
the signatory agency(ies) supporting the FBI will coordinate and manage the technical portion of the response and
activate/request assistance under the FRERP for measures to protect the public health and safety. In all cases, the
FBI will manage and direct the law enforcement and intelligence aspects of the response; coordinating activities
with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies within the framework of the FRERP and/or as provided for in established
interagency agreements or plans.


D. Response Functions and Responsibilities


1. Onscene Coordination


The LFA will coordinate all Federal onscene actions and assist State and local governments in determining measures
to protect life, property, and the environment. The LFA will ensure that FEMA and other Federal agencies assist the
State and local government agencies in implementing protective actions, if requested by the State and local government
agencies.
The LFA will coordinate Federal response activities from an onscene location, referred to as the Joint Operations
Center (JOC). Until the LFA has established its base of operations in a JOC, the LFA will accomplish that coordination
from another LFA facility, usually a Headquarters operations center.
For radiological emergencies occurring on or with possible consequences to Indian tribal lands, DOI will provide
liaison between Federally recognized Indian tribal governments and LFA, State, and local agencies for coordination
of response and protective action efforts. Additionally, DOI will advise and assist the LFA on economic, social,
and political matters in the Virgin Islands and the Territories of Guam, American Samoa, and the Trust Territories
of the Pacific Islands should a radiological emergency occur in these areas.

2. Onsite Management


The LFA will oversee the onsite response; monitor and support owner or operator activities (when there is an owner
or operator); provide technical support to the owner or operator, if requested; and serve as the principal Federal
source of information about onsite conditions. The LFA will provide a hazard assessment of onsite conditions that
might have significant offsite impact and ensure onsite measures are taken to mitigate offsite consequences.


3. Radiological Monitoring and Assessment


DOE has the initial responsibility for coordinating the offsite Federal radiological monitoring and assessment
assistance during the response to a radiological emergency. In a prolonged response, EPA will assume the responsibility
for coordinating the assistance at some mutually agreeable time, usually after the emergency phase.
Some of the participating Federal agencies may have radiological planning and emergency responsibilities as part
of their statutory authority, as well as established working relationships with State counterpart agencies. The
monitoring and assessment activity, coordinated by DOE, does not alter those responsibilities but complements
them by providing for coordination of the initial Federal radiological monitoring and assessment response activity.
Activities will:
(1) Support the monitoring and assessment programs of the States,
(2) Respond to the assessment needs of the LFA, and
(3) Meet statutory responsibilities of participating Federal agencies.
Federal offsite monitoring and assessment activities will be coordinated with those of the State. Federal agency
plans and procedures for implementing this monitoring and assessment activity are designed to be compatible with
the radiological emergency planning requirements for State, local governments, specific facilities, and existing
memoranda of understanding and interagency agreements.
DOE may respond to a State or LFA request for assistance by dispatching a Radiological Assistance Program (RAP) team.
If the situation requires more assistance than a RAP team can provide, DOE will alert or activate additional resources.
These resources may include the establishment of a Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC)
to be used as an onscene coordination center for Federal radiological assessment activities. States are encouraged
to collocate their radiological assessment activities at this center.
Federal radiological monitoring and assessment activities will be activated as a component of an FRERP response
or pursuant to a direct request from State or local governments, other Federal agencies, licensees for radiological
materials, industries, or the general public after evaluating the magnitude of the problem and coordinating with
the State(s) involved.
DOE and other participating Federal agencies may learn of an emergency when they are alerted to a possible problem
or receive a request for radiological assistance. DOE will maintain national and regional coordination offices
as points of access to Federal radiological emergency assistance. Requests for Federal radiological monitoring
and assessment assistance will generally be directed to the appropriate DOE radiological assistance Regional Coordinating
Office. Requests also can go directly to DOE's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Washington, DC. When other agencies
receive requests for Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance, they will promptly notify the
DOE EOC.


a. Role of Department of Energy (DOE). 

(1) Initial Response Coordination Responsibility. DOE, as coordinator, has the following responsibilities:
(a) Coordinate Federal offsite radiological monitoring and assessment activities;
(b) Maintain technical liaison with State and local agencies with monitoring and assessment responsibilities;
(c) Maintain a common set of all offsite radiological monitoring data, in an accountable, secure, and retrievable
form, and ensure the technical integrity of the data;
(d) Provide monitoring data and interpretations, including exposure rate contours, dose projections, and any other
requested radiological assessments, to the LFA, and to the States;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) Provide, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, the personnel and 
equipment needed to perform radiological monitoring and assessment activities; 
(f) Request supplemental assistance and technical support from other 
Federal agencies as needed; and 
(g) Arrange consultation and support services through appropriate Federal 
agencies to all other entities (e.g., private contractors) with radiological monitoring 
functions and capabilities, and technical and medical advice on handling radiological 
contamination. 
(2) Transition of Response Coordination Responsibility. The DOE FRMAC Director will work closely with the Senior
EPA representative to facilitate a smooth transition of the Federal radiological monitoring and assessment coordination
responsibility to EPA at a mutually agreeable time and after 
consultation with the States and LFA. The following conditions are intended to be met prior to this transfer: 
(a) The immediate emergency condition has been stabilized; 
(b) Offsite releases of radioactive material have ceased, and there is little or no potential for further unintentional
offsite releases; 
(c) The offsite radiological conditions have been characterized and the 
immediate consequences have been assessed; 
(d) An initial long-range monitoring plan has been developed in conjunction with the affected States and appropriate
Federal agencies; and 
(e) EPA has received adequate assurances from the other Federal agencies 
that they will commit the required resources, personnel, and funds for the duration of the Federal response. 


b. Role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

(1) Prior to assuming responsibility for the FRMAC, EPA will provide resources, including personnel, equipment,
and laboratory support (including mobile laboratories), to assist DOE in monitoring radioactivity levels in the
environment. 
(2) Assume coordination of Federal radiological monitoring and assessment 
responsibilities from DOE after the transition. 
(3) Assist in the development and implementation of a long-term monitoring 
plan. 
(4) Provide nationwide environmental monitoring data from the 
Environmental Radiation Ambient Monitoring Systems for assessing the national 
impact of the accident. 


c. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA). 

(1) Approve the release of official Federal offsite monitoring data and assessments to the State. 
(2) Provide other available radiological monitoring data to the State and to the FRMAC. 


d. Role of Other Federal Agencies. 

Agencies carrying out responsibilities related to radiological monitoring and assessment during a Federal response
also will coordinate their activities with FRMAC. This coordination will not limit the normal working relationship
between a Federal agency and its State counterparts nor restrict the flow of information from that agency to the States.
The radiological monitoring and assessment responsibilities of the other Federal agencies include: 
(1) Department of Agriculture (USDA).
(a) Inspect meat and meat products, poultry and poultry products, and egg 
products identified for interstate and foreign commerce to assure that they are safe for human consumption. 
(b) Assist, in conjunction with HHS, in monitoring the production, 
processing, storage, and distribution of food through the wholesale level to eliminate contaminated product or
to reduce the contamination in the product to a safe level. 
(c) Collect agricultural samples within the Ingestion Exposure Pathway 
Emergency Planning Zone. Assist in the evaluation and assessment of data to 
determine the impact of the emergency on agriculture. 
(2) Department of Commerce (DOC).
(a) Prepare operational weather forecasts tailored to support emergency 
response activities. 
(b) Prepare and disseminate predictions of plume trajectories, dispersion, 
and deposition. 
(c) Archive, as a special collection, the meteorological data from national observing systems applicable to the
monitoring and assessment of the response.

(d) Ensure that marine fishery products available to the public are not 
contaminated. 
(e) Provide assistance and reference material for calibrating radiological 
instruments. 
(3) Department of Defense (DOD).
(a) Provide radiological resources to include trained response personnel, 
specialized radiation instruments, mobile instrument calibration, repair capabilities, and 
expertise in site restoration. 
(b) Perform special sampling of airborne contamination on request. 
(4) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

(6) Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
(a) Provide assistance in Federal radiological monitoring and assessment 
activities during incidents. 
(b) Provide continuous measurement of ambient radiation levels around 
NRC licensed facilities, primarily power reactors using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). 


4. Protective Action Recommendations 


Federal protective action recommendations provide advice to State and local governments on measures that they should
take to avoid or reduce exposure of the public to radiation from a release of radioactive material. This includes emergency
actions such as sheltering, evacuation, and prophylactic use of iodine. It also includes longer term measures to
avoid or minimize exposure to residual radiation or exposure through the ingestion pathway such as restriction of
food, temporary relocation, and permanent resettlement. 


a. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA). 

The LFA will assist State and local authorities, if requested, by advising them on protective actions for the public.
The development or evaluation of protective action recommendations will be based upon the Protective Action Guides
(PAGs) issued by EPA and HHS. In providing such advice, the LFA will use advice from 
other Federal agencies with technical expertise on those matters whenever possible. The LFA's responsibilities
for the development, evaluation, and presentation of protective action recommendations are to: 
(1) Respond to requests from State and local governments for technical 
information and assistance. 
(2) Consult with representatives from EPA, HHS, USDA, and other Federal 
agencies as needed to provide advice to the LFA on protective actions. 
(3) Review all recommendations made by other Federal agencies exercising 
statutory authorities related to protective actions to ensure consistency. 
(4) Prepare a coordinated Federal position on protective action 
recommendations whenever time permits. 
(5) Present the Federal assessment of protective action recommendations, in conjunction with FEMA and other Federal
agencies when practical, to State or other offsite authorities. 


b. Role of the Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health. 

Advice on environment, food, and health matters will be provided to the LFA 
through the Advisory Team for Environment, Food, and Health (Advisory Team) 
consisting of representatives of EPA, HHS, and USDA supported by other Federal 
agencies, as warranted by the circumstances of the emergency. The Advisory Team provides direct support to the LFA
and has no independent authority. The Advisory Team will not release information to the public or make recommendations
on matters under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency unless authorized to do so by that agency. The Advisory Team will
select a chairman for the Team. The Advisory Team will normally collocate with the FRMAC. 
For emergencies with potential for causing widespread radiological 
contamination where no onscene FRMAC is established, the functions of the Advisory 
Team may be accomplished in the LFA response facility in Washington, DC. 
The primary role of the Advisory Team is to provide a mechanism for timely, 
interagency coordination of advice to the LFA and other Federal agencies concerning 
matters related to the following areas: 
(1) Environmental assessments (field monitoring) required for developing 
recommendations. 
(2) PAGs and their application to the emergency. 
(3) Protective action recommendations using data and assessment from the 
FRMAC. 
(4) Protective actions to prevent or minimize contamination of milk, food, 
and water and to prevent or minimize exposure through ingestion. 
(5) Recommendations regarding the disposition of contaminated livestock 
and poultry. 
(6) Recommendations for minimizing losses of agricultural resources from 
radiation effects. 
(7) Availability of food, animal feed, and water supply inspection programs 
to assure wholesomeness.

(8) Relocation, reentry, and other radiation protection measures prior to 
recovery. 

(9) Recommendations for recovery, return, and cleanup issues. 

(10) Health and safety advice or information for the public and for workers. 

(11) Estimate effects of radioactive releases on human health and 
environment. 

(12) Guidance on the use of radioprotective substances (e.g., thyroid 
blocking agents), including dosage and projected radiation doses that warrant the use of such drugs. 

(13) Other matters, as requested by the LFA. 



5. Other Federal Resource Support 



FEMA will coordinate the provision of non-technical (i.e., not related to 
radiological monitoring and assessment) Federal resources and assistance to affected State and local governments.
The Federal non-technical resource and assistance coordination function will be performed at the Disaster Field
Office (DFO) established by FEMA. 



a. Role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

FEMA will, as requested: 

(1) Monitor the status of the Federal response to requests for non-technical assistance from the affected States
and provide this information to the States. 

(2) Keep the LFA informed of requests for assistance from the State and the status of the Federal response. 

(3) Identify and inform Federal agencies of actual or apparent omissions, 
redundancies, or conflicts in response activity. 

(4) Establish and maintain a source of integrated, coordinated information 
about the status of all non-technical resource support activities. 

(5) Provide information systems capabilities to meet the needs of agencies 
and organizations represented at the DFO. 

(6) Provide other non-technical support to Federal agencies responding to 
the emergency. 



b. Role of Other Federal Agencies. 

In order to properly coordinate activities, Federal agencies responding to requests for non-technical support
or directly providing such support under statutory authorities will provide liaison personnel to the DFO. The following
indicates types of assistance not related to radiological monitoring and assessment that may be provided by Federal
agencies as needed or requested: 

(1) Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

(a) Provide emergency food coupon assistance in officially designated 
disaster areas, if a need is determined by officials and if the commercial food system is sufficient to accommodate

provision of the telecommunications services. 

(11) National Communications System (NCS).

Coordinate the communications for the Federal response and assist appropriate State agencies in meeting their communications
requirements. 



6. Public Information Coordination



Public information coordination is most effective when the owner/operator, 
Federal, State, local, and other relevant information sources participate jointly. The primary location for linking
these sources is the Joint Information Center (JIC). 

Prior to the establishment of Federal operations at the JIC, it may be necessary to release Federal information regarding
public health and safety. In these instances, Federal agencies will coordinate with the LFA in advance or as soon as
possible after the information has been released. 

This coordination will accomplish the following: 

(1) Compile information about the status of the emergency, response 
actions, and instructions for the affected population; 

(2) Coordinate all information from various sources with the other Federal, State, local, and non-governmental
response organizations; 

(3) Allow various sources to work cooperatively, yet maintain their 
independence in disseminating information;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-2-00119 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-2-00083 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Disseminate timely, consistent, and accurate information to the public 
and the news media; and 

(5) Establish coordinated arrangements for dealing with citizen inquiries. 



a. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA)

. The LFA is responsible for information on the status of the overall Federal response, specific LFA response activities,
and the status of onsite conditions. 

The LFA will: 

(1) Develop joint information procedures for providing Federal information 
to and for obtaining information from all Federal agencies participating in the response; 

(2) Work with the owner/operator and State and local government 
information officers to develop timely coordinated public information releases; 

(3) Inform the media that the JIC is the primary source of onscene public 
information and news from facility, local, State, and Federal spokespersons; 

(4) Establish and manage Federal public information operations at the JIC; 
and 

(5) Coordinate Federal public information among the various media centers. 



b. Role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 FEMA will assist the LFA in coordinating non-technical information among Federal agencies and with the State. When
mutually agreeable, FEMA may assume 
responsibility from the LFA for coordinating Federal public information. Should this occur, it will usually be after
the onsite situation has been stabilized and recovery efforts have begun. 



c. Role of Other Participating Agencies.

All Federal agencies with an operational response role under the FRERP will coordinate public information activities
at the JIC. Each Federal agency will provide information on the status of its response and on technical information.




7. Congressional and White House Coordination 



a. Congressional Coordination.

 Federal agencies will coordinate their responses to Congressional requests for information with the LFA. Points
of contact for this function are the Congressional Liaison Officers. All Federal agency Congressional Liaison Officers
and Congressional staffs seeking site-specific information about the emergency should contact the LFA headquarters
Congressional Affairs Office. Congress may request information directly from any Federal agency. Any agency responding
to such requests should inform the LFA as soon as feasible. 



b. White House Coordination.

 The LFA will report to the President and keep the White House informed on all aspects of the emergency. The White House
may request information directly from any Federal agency. Any agency responding to such requests should inform the
LFA as soon as feasible. The LFA will submit reports to the White House. The initial report should cover, if possible,
the nature of and prognosis for the radiological situation causing the emergency and the actual or potential offsite
radiological impact. 
Subsequent reports by the LFA should cover the status of mitigation, corrective actions, protective measures, and
overall Federal response to the emergency. Federal agencies should provide information related to the technical
and radiological aspects of the response directly to the LFA. FEMA will compile information related to the non-technical
resource support aspects of the response and submit to the LFA for inclusion in the report(s). 



8. International Coordination 



In the event of an environmental impact or potential impact upon the United States, its possessions, Territories,
or territorial waters from a radiological emergency originating on foreign soil or, conversely, a domestic incident
with an actual or potential foreign impact, the LFA will immediately inform DOS (which has responsibility for official
interactions with foreign governments). The LFA will keep DOS informed of all Federal response activities. The DOS
will coordinate notification and information gathering activities with foreign governments, except in cases where
existing bilateral agreements permit direct communication. Where the LFA has existing bilateral agreements that
permit direct exchange of information, those agencies 
should keep DOS informed of consultations with their foreign counterparts. Agency officials should take care that
consultations do not exceed the scope of the relevant agreement(s). The LFA will ensure that any offers of assistance
to or requests from foreign governments are coordinated with DOS.

9. Response Function Overview 



Table II-2 provides an overview of the responsible Federal agencies for major response functions. 



 


E. Stages of the Federal Response 



The Federal response is divided into five stages: Notification, Activation and Deployment, Response Operations,
Response Deactivation, and Recovery. 



1. Notification 



The owner or operator of the facility or radiological activity is generally the 
first to become aware of a radiological emergency and is responsible for notifying the 
State and local authorities and the LFA. The notification should include: 

(1) Location and nature of the accident, 

(2) An assessment of the severity of the problem, 

(3) Potential and actual offsite consequences, and 

(4) Initial response actions. 

If any Federal agency receives notification from any source other than FEMA or the LFA, the agency will notify the LFA.
See Figure II-1 for the notification process. 



a. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA). 

(1) Verify accuracy of notification, 

(2) Notify FEMA and advisory team agencies and provide information, 

(3) Verify that other Federal agencies have been notified, and 

(4) Verify that the State has been notified. 



b. Role of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

. (1) Verify that the State has been notified of the emergency, and 

(2) Notify other Federal agencies as appropriate.

2. Activation and Deployment 


Once notified, each agency will respond according to its plan. The LFA will assess the technical response requirements
and cause the activation and deployment of response components. FEMA, in conjunction with the LFA, will coordinate
the non-technical assistance in support of State and local governments. Initially, the LFA, FEMA, and other Federal
agencies will coordinate response actions from their headquarters locations, usually from their respective headquarters
EOCs. 


a. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA).

 (1) Deploy LFA response personnel to the scene and provide liaison to the State and local authorities as appropriate;

(2) Designate a Federal Onscene Commander (OSC) at the scene of the 
emergency to manage onsite activities and coordinate the overall Federal response to the emergency; 
(3) Establish bases of Federal operation, such as the JOC and the JIC; 
(4) Coordinate the Federal response with the owner/operator; and 
(5) Provide advice on the radiological hazard to the Federal responders. 


b. Role of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 (1) Deploy an Advance Emergency Response Team (ERT-A) to the State EOC;
(2) Designate a Senior FEMA Official (SFO);
(3) Establish a DFO; and 
(4) Establish contact with the LFA and the responsible State agency to 
determine the status of response efforts. 


c. Role of Other Federal Agencies.

 (1) Designate an onscene Senior Agency Official; 
(2) Activate agency emergency response personnel and deploy them to the 
scene; 
(3) Deploy FRMAC assets; 
(4) Deploy Advisory Team representatives; 
(5) Keep the LFA and FEMA informed of status of response activities; and 
(6) Coordinate all State requests and offsite activities with the LFA and 
FEMA, as appropriate. 


3. Response Operations 


The following describes the general operational structure for meeting Federal agency roles and responsibilities
in response to a radiological emergency. At the headquarters level, the LFA, FEMA, and other Federal agencies (OFAs)
will generally exchange liaison personnel and maintain staffs at their EOCs to support their respective onscene
operations. Federal agencies may also activate a regional or field office EOC in support of the emergency. Figure
II-2 provides a graphic depiction of the onscene structure.

a. Joint Operations Center (JOC).

 The JOC
 is established by the LFA under the operational control of the Federal OSC, as the focal point for management and direction
of onsite activities, establishment of State requirements and priorities, and coordination of the overall Federal
response. The JOC may be established in a separate onscene location or collocated with an existing emergency operations
facility. The following elements may be represented in the JOC: 




(a) LFA staff and onsite liaison; 
(b) FEMA/DFO liaison; 
(c) FRMAC liaison; 
(d) Advisory Team liaison; 
(e) Other Federal agency liaison, as needed; 
(f) LFA Public information liaison; 
(g) LFA Congressional liaison; and 
(h) State and local liaison. 


b. Disaster Field Office (DFO).

 The DFO is established by FEMA, under the operational control of the SFO, as the focal point for the coordination and
provision of non-technical resource support based on coordinated State requirements/priorities. The DFO is established
at an onscene location in coordination with State and local authorities and other Federal agencies. The following
elements may be represented in the DFO: 
(a) LFA liaison, 
(b) Other appropriate Federal agency personnel, 
(c) State and local liaison, 
(d) Public information liaison, and 
(e) Congressional liaison. 


c. Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC).

 The FRMAC is established by DOE (with subsequent transfer to EPA for intermediate and long-term actions) for the coordination
of Federal radiological monitoring and assessment activities with that of State and local agencies. The FRMAC is
established at an onscene location in coordination with State and local authorities and other Federal agencies.
The following elements may be represented in the FRMAC: 
(a) DOE/DOE contractor technical staff and capabilities; 
(b) EPA/EPA contractor technical staff and capabilities; 
(c) DOC technical staff and capabilities; 
(d) LFA technical liaison; 
(e) DOE public information liaison; 
(f) Other Federal agency liaisons, as needed; 
(g) State and local liaison; and 
(h) DFO liaison. 


d. Advisory Team on Environment, Food, and Health.

 The Advisory Team is established by representatives from EPA, LFA, USDA, HHS, and other Federal agencies as needed
for the provision of interagency coordinated advice and recommendations to the LFA concerning environmental, food,
and health matters. For the ease of transfer of radiological monitoring and assessment data and coordination with
Federal, State, and local representatives, the Advisory Team is normally collocated with the FRMAC. 


e. Joint Information Center (JIC).

 The JIC
 is established by the LFA, under the operational control of the LFA-designated Public Information Officer, as a focal
point for the coordination and provision of information to the public and media concerning the Federal response to
the emergency. The JIC is established at an onscene location in coordination with State and local agencies and other
Federal agencies. The following elements should be represented at the JIC: 




(a) LFA Public Information Officer and staff; 
(b) FEMA Public Information Officer and staff; 
(c) Other Federal agency Public Information, as needed; 
(d) State and local Public Information Officers; and 
(e) Owner/Operator Public Information Officers and staff.

4. Response Deactivation 


a. Each agency will discontinue emergency response operations when advised that Federal assistance is no longer
required from their agency or when its statutory responsibilities have been fulfilled. Prior to discontinuing its
response operation, each agency should discuss its intent to do so with the LFA, FEMA, and the State. 
b. The LFA will consult with participating Federal agencies and the State and local government to determine when the
Federal information coordination operations at the JIC should be terminated. This will occur normally at a time when
the rate of information generated and coordinated by the LFA has decreased to the point where it can be handled through
the normal day-to-day coordination process. The LFA will inform the other participants of their intention to deactivate
Federal information coordination operations at the JIC and advise them of the procedures for continued coordination
of information pertinent to recovery from the radiological emergency. 
c. FEMA will consult with the LFA, other Federal agencies, and the 
State(s) as to when the onscene coordination operation of the DFO is no longer required. Prior to ending operations
at the DFO, FEMA will inform all participating organizations of the schedule for doing so. 
d. The LFA will terminate JOC operations and the Federal response after consulting with FEMA, other participating
Federal agencies, and State and local officials, and after determining that onscene Federal assistance is no longer
required. 
e. The agency managing the FRMAC will consult with the LFA, FEMA, other participating Federal agencies, and State
and local officials to determine when a formal FRMAC structure and organization is no longer required. Normally,
this will occur when operations move into the recovery phase and extensive Federal multi-agency resources are no
longer required to augment State and local radiological monitoring and assessment activities. 


5. Recovery 


a. The State or local governments have the primary responsibility for planning the recovery of the affected area.
(The term recovery as used here encompasses any action dedicated to the continued protection of the public and resumption
of normal activities in the affected area.) Recovery planning will be initiated at the request of the States, but it
will generally not take place until after the initiating conditions of the emergency have stabilized and immediate
actions to protect public health and safety and property have been accomplished. The Federal Government will, on
request, assist the State and local governments in developing offsite recovery plans, prior to the deactivation
of the Federal response. The LFA will coordinate the overall activity of Federal agencies involved in the recovery
process. 
b. The radiological monitoring and assessment activities will be terminated when the EPA, after consultation with
the LFA and other participating Federal agencies, and State and local officials, determines that:
(1) There is no longer a threat to the public health and safety or to the environment, 
(2) State and local resources are adequate for the situation, and 
(3) There is mutual agreement of the agencies involved to terminate the 
response.

the LFA and is determined by the type of emergency. In situations where a Federal agency owns, authorizes, regulates,
or is otherwise deemed responsible for the facility or radiological activity causing the emergency and has authority
to conduct and manage Federal actions onsite, that agency normally will be the LFA. 


License

_An authorization issued to a facility owner or operator by the NRC pursuant to the conditions of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 (as amended), or issued by an Agreement State pursuant to appropriate State laws. NRC licenses certain
activities under section 170(a) of that Act. 


Local Government

_Any county, city, village, town, district, or political subdivision of any State, and Indian tribe or authorized
tribal organization, or Alaska Native village or organization, including any rural community or unincorporated
town or village or any other public entity. 


Monitoring

_The use of sampling and radiation detection equipment to determine the levels of radiation. 


National Defense Area (NDA)

_An area established on non-Federal lands 
located within the United States, its possessions or its territories, for safeguarding classified defense information
or protecting DOD equipment and/or material. Establishment of a National Defense Area temporarily places such non-Federal
lands under the effective control of the Department of Defense and results only from an emergency event. The senior
DOD representative at the scene shall define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning signs.
The landowner's consent and cooperation shall be obtained whenever possible; however, military necessity shall
dictate the final location, shape, and size of the NDA. 


National Security Area (NSA)

_An area established on non-Federal lands located within the United States, its possessions or territories, for
safeguarding classified information, and/or restricted data or equipment and material belonging to DOE or NASA.
Establishment of a National Security Area temporarily places such non-Federal lands under the effective control
of DOE or NASA and results only from an emergency event. The senior DOE or NASA representative having custody of the

consent and cooperation shall be obtained whenever possible; however, operational necessity shall dictate the
final location, shape, and size of the NSA. 


Nuclear Facilities

_Nuclear installations that use or produce radioactive materials in their normal operations. 


Offsite

_The area outside the boundary of the onsite area. For emergencies occurring at fixed nuclear facilities, ``offsite''
generally refers to the area beyond the facility boundary. For emergencies that do not occur at fixed nuclear facilities
and for which no physical boundary exists, the circumstances of the emergency will dictate the boundary of the offsite
area. Unless a Federal agency has the authority to define and control a restricted area, the State or local government
will define an area as ``onsite'' at the time of the emergency, based on required response activities. 


Offsite Federal Support

_Federal assistance in mitigating the offsite consequences of an emergency and protecting the public health and
safety, including assistance with determining and implementing public protective action measures. 


Onscene

_The area directly affected by radiological contamination and environs. Onscene includes onsite and offsite areas.



Onscene Commander (OSC)

_The lead official designated at the scene of the emergency to manage onsite activities and coordinate the overall
Federal response to the emergency. 


Onsite

_The area within (a) the boundary established by the owner or operator of a fixed nuclear facility, or (b) the area established
by the LFA as a National Defense Area or National Security Area, or (c) the area established around a downed/ditched
U.S. spacecraft, or (d) the boundary established at the time of the emergency by the State or local government with
jurisdiction for a transportation accident not occurring at a fixed nuclear facility and not involving nuclear weapons.



Onsite Federal Support

_Federal assistance that is the primary responsibility of the Federal agency that owns, authorizes, regulates,
or is otherwise deemed responsible for the radiological facility or material being transported, i.e., the LFA. This
response supports State and local efforts by supporting the owner or operator's efforts to bring the incident under
control and thereby prevent or minimize offsite consequences.

B. Department of Commerce 


1. Summary of Response Mission 



The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary agency within the Department of Commerce
(DOC) responsible for providing assistance to the Federal, State, and local organizations responding to a radiological
emergency. Other assistance may be provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. DOC's responsibilities
include: 

(1) Acquiring and disseminating weather data and providing weather 
forecasts in direct support of the emergency response operation; 
(2) Preparing and disseminating predictions of plume trajectories, 
dispersion, and deposition of radiological material released into the atmosphere; 
(3) Providing local meteorological support as needed to assure the 
quality of these predictions; 
(4) Organizing and maintaining a special data archive for 
meteorological information related to the emergency and its assessment; 
(5) Ensuring that marine fishery products available to the public are not 
contaminated; 
(6) Providing assistance and reference material for calibrating 
radiological instruments; and 
(7) Loaning radiation shielding materials. 



2. Capabilities and Resources 



NOAA is the principal DOC participant in the response to a radiation accident. NOAA prepares both routine and special
weather forecasts, and makes use of these forecasts to predict atmospheric transport and dispersion. NOAA's forecasts
may be the basis for all public announcements on the movement of contamination from accidents occurring outside U.S.
territory or during domestic accidents when any released radioactive material is expected to be carried offsite.
NOAA has capabilities to do the following: 

(1) Provide current and forecast meteorological information as needed to guide aerial monitoring and sampling,
and to predict the transport and dispersion of radioactive materials (gases, liquids, and particles). 

(2) Routinely forecast the atmospheric transport, dispersion, and deposition of the radioactive materials, and
disseminate the results of these computations via automatic facsimile to all relevant parties, twice per day. 

(3) Produce (and archive) special high-resolution meteorological data sets for providing an improved capability
to predict atmospheric transport and dispersion of radioactive materials in the atmosphere. 

(4) Augment routine and special upper atmosphere and surface meteorological observation systems, as required to
improve the quality of these predictions. 

(5) Evaluate NOAA's transport and dispersion forecast products in conjunction with those of other nations' weather
services responding to the emergency, to provide a more internationally consistent product.

C. Department of Defense 



1. Summary of Response Mission 



The Department of Defense (DOD) is charged with the safe handling, storage, maintenance, assembly, and transportation
of nuclear weapons and other radioactive materials in DOD custody, and with the safe operation of DOD nuclear facilities.
Inherent in this responsibility is the requirement to protect life and property from any health or safety hazards
that could ensue from an accident or significant incident associated with these materials or activities. 

The DOD role in a Federal response will depend on the circumstances of the 
emergency. DOD will be the LFA if the emergency involves one of its facilities or a nuclear weapon in its custody. Within
DOD, the military service or agency 
responsible for the facility, ship, or area is responsible for the onsite response. The military service or agency
having custody of the material outside an installation boundary is responsible for the onsite response. For emergencies
occurring under circumstances for which DOD is not responsible, DOD will not be the LFA, but will support and assist
in the Federal response. 



2. Capabilities and Resources 



Offsite authority and responsibility at a nuclear accident rest with State and local officials. It is important to
recognize that for nuclear weapons or weapon component accidents, land may be temporarily placed under effective
Federal control by the establishment of a National Defense Area or National Security Area to protect U.S. Government
classified materials. These lands will revert back to State control upon disestablishment of the National Defense
Area or National Security Area. 

DOD has a trained and equipped nuclear response organization to deal with 
accidents at its facilities or involving materials in its custody. Radiological resources include trained response
personnel, specialized radiation instruments, and mobile instrument calibration and repair capabilities. DOD
also may perform special sampling of airborne contamination on request. Descriptions of the capabilities and assets
of DOD response teams can be found in DOD 5100.52M. 

DOD may provide assistance in the form of personnel, logistics and telecommunications, assistance and expertise
in site restoration, including airlift services, 
when available, upon the request of the LFA or FEMA. Requests for assistance must 
be directed to the National Military Command Center or through channels established 
by prior agreements.

D. Department of Energy 



1. Summary of Response Mission 



The Department of Energy (DOE) owns and operates a variety of radiological 
activities throughout the United States. These activities include: fixed nuclear sites; the use, storage, and shipment
of a variety of radioactive materials; the shipment of spent reactor fuel; the production, assembly, and shipment
of nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials; the production and shipment of radioactive sources for space ventures;
and the storage and shipment of radioactive and mixed waste. DOE is responsible for the safe operation of these activities
and should an emergency occur at one of its sites or an activity under its control, DOE will be the LFA for the Federal

response. 

Due to its technical capabilities and resources, the DOE may perform other 
roles within the Federal response to a radiological emergency. With extensive, field-based radiological resources
throughout the United States available for emergency deployment, the DOE responds to requests for offsite radiological
monitoring and assessment assistance and serves as the initial coordinator of all such Federal assistance (to include
initial management of the FRMAC) to State and local governments. With other specialized, deployable assets, DOE
assists other Federal agencies responding to malevolent nuclear emergencies, accidents involving nuclear weapons
not under DOE custody, emergencies caused by satellites containing radioactive sources, and other radiological
incidents as appropriate. 



2. Capabilities and Resources 



DOE has trained personnel, radiological instruments, mobile laboratories, and radioanalytical facilities located
at its national laboratories, production, and other facilities throughout the country. Through eight Regional
Coordinating Offices, these resources form the basis for the Radiological Assistance Program, which can provide
technical assistance in any radiological emergency. DOE can provide specialized radiation detection instruments
and support for both its response as LFA and as initial 
coordinator of Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance. Some of the specialized resources and
capabilities include: 

(1) Aerial monitoring capability for tracking dispersion of radioactive 
material and mapping ground contamination; 

(2) A computer-based, emergency preparedness and response predictive 
capability that provides rapid predictions of the transport, diffusion, and deposition of radionuclides released
to the atmosphere and dose projections to people and the environment; 

(3) Specialized equipment and instruments and response teams for 
locating radioactive materials and handling damaged nuclear weapons; 

(4) Medical experts on radiation effects and the treatment of exposed or 
contaminated patients; and 

(5) Support facilities for DOE response, including command post 
supplies, communications systems, generators, and portable video and photographic capabilities.

The Department of State (DOS) is responsible for the conduct of relations 
between the U.S. Government and other governments and international organizations and for the protection of U.S.
interests and citizens abroad. 


In a radiological emergency outside the United States, DOS is responsible for coordinating U.S. Government actions
concerning the event in the country where it occurs (including evacuation of U.S. citizens, if necessary) and internationally.
Should the FRERP be invoked due to the need for domestic action, DOS will continue to hold this role within the FRPCC
structure. Specifically, DOS will coordinate foreign information-gathering activities and, in particular, conduct
all contacts with foreign governments except in cases where existing bilateral agreements permit direct agency-to-agency
cooperation. In the latter situation, the U.S. agency will keep DOS fully 
informed of all communications. 


In a domestic radiological emergency with potential international trans-boundary consequences, DOS will coordinate
all contacts with foreign governments and agencies except where existing bilateral agreements provide for direct
exchange of information. DOS is responsible for conveying the U.S. Government response to foreign offers of assistance.





2. Capabilities and Resources 



The State Department maintains embassies, missions, interest sections (in 
countries where the United States does not have diplomatic relations), and consulates throughout the world. The
State Department Operations Center is capable of secure, immediate, around-the-clock communications with diplomatic
posts. The diplomatic personnel stationed at a post are knowledgeable of local factors important to clear and concise
communication, and frequently speak the local language. The Ambassador is the President's personal representative
to the host government, and his country team is responsible for coordinating official contacts between the U.S. Government
and the host government or international organization.

The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal financial assistance on areas of identified national need. These
priorities are intended to prepare individuals to enter rehabilitation professions and to maintain and upgrade
the basic skills and knowledge of trained rehabilitation professionals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains one proposed priority under the statutory authority for Rehabilitation Training, one proposed
priority under the Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs, four proposed priorities under the Rehabilitation
Short-Term Training program, and two proposed priorities under the Interpreter Training for Individuals Who Are
Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind program. A separate competition would be established for each priority.
These programs are authorized by section 302 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The purpose of each
program is stated separately under the title of that program.



The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priorities,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the
Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities,
subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.

These priorities support the National Education Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship. The Department supports a variety of training activities in vocational rehabilitation, and training
enhances the knowledge and skills of personnel.






Note:

 This notice of proposed priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. In any year in which the Secretary chooses to use a priority, the Secretary invites applications
through a notice in the 

Federal Register

. When inviting applications the Secretary designates a priority as absolute or competitive preference or invitational.
The effect of each type of priority follows:






Absolute priority:

 Under an absolute priority the Secretary funds only applications that meet the priority (34 CFR 75.105(c)(3)).



Competitive preference priority:

 Under a competitive preference priority the Secretary gives competitive preference to applications by either (1)
awarding, to an application that meets the competitive priority in a particularly effective way, additional points
beyond any points the application earns under the selection criteria (34 CFR 75.105(c)(2)(i)); or (2) selecting
an application that meets the competitive priority over applications of comparable merit that do not meet the priority
(34 CFR 75.105(c)(2)(ii)).



Invitational priority:

 Under an invitational priority the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the invitational
priority. However, an application that meets the invitational priority does not receive competitive or absolute
preference over other applications (34 CFR 75.105(c)(1)).

Priority



Proposed Priority_National Clearinghouse of Rehabilitation Training Materials





Background:

 The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) has funded a clearinghouse for rehabilitation training materials
since 1961. Over the years, the clearinghouse has facilitated the development and dissemination of material for
use in the training of rehabilitation personnel. Regulations for the Rehabilitation Training program in 34 CFR 385.42
state that a set of any training materials developed under the Rehabilitation Training program must be submitted
to any information clearinghouse designated by the Secretary. The project funded under this priority would be designated
to receive training materials developed by other projects during the project's duration. Users of the clearinghouse
cover the range of rehabilitation providers, but most frequently include State vocational rehabilitation agency
personnel, rehabilitation counselors, rehabilitation educators, community rehabilitation program personnel,
and advocates for individuals with disabilities.

The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.



Priority



The project must_

 Demonstrate experience and capacity to provide for a national clearinghouse of rehabilitation training
materials;

 Identify and gather rehabilitation information and training materials for use in preparing pre-service
and in-service education and training for rehabilitation personnel;

 Disseminate, in a cost-effective manner, rehabilitation information and state-of-the-art training materials
and methods to rehabilitation personnel to assist them in achieving improved outcomes in vocational rehabilitation,
supported employment, and independent living; and

 Provide linkages and policies for the exchange of information and referral of inquiries with other existing
clearinghouses and information centers supported by the U.S. Department of Education, including the Educational
Resources Information Center and the National Rehabilitation Information Center.



Selection Criteria:

 In evaluating applications for grants under this competition, the Secretary uses the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations selection criteria in 34 CFR 75.210.

The regulations in 34 CFR 75.210 provide that the Secretary may award up to 100 points for the selection criteria, including
a reserved 15 points. For this competition, the Secretary distributes the additional 15 points as follows:



Plan of operation

 (34 CFR 75.210(b)(3)). Fifteen points are added to this criterion for a possible total of 30 points.



Applicable Program Regulations:

 34 CFR Part 385.



Program Authority:

 29 U.S.C. 774.

Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs




Purpose of Program: 

The Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs are designed to support training centers that serve either a Federal
region or another geographical area and provide for a broad integrated sequence of training activities that focus
on meeting recurrent and common training needs of employed rehabilitation personnel throughout a multi-State geographical
area.

Priority


Proposed Priority_Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs for Providers of Community Rehabilitation Services





Background: 

In section 2(a) (2) and (5) of the Act, Congress reported findings that, as a group, individuals with disabilities
constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups in society subject to discrimination in many critical areas, including
employment. Furthermore, Congress found that individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most
severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate
services and supports are provided. 
Community rehabilitation programs, working closely with individuals with disabilities, their advocates, representatives,
families, labor unions, and employers, are a significant resource for addressing the national problem of unemployment
and underemployment of individuals with severe disabilities. Those programs serve an estimated two million individuals
with disabilities annually, many through referral arrangements with vocational rehabilitation State agencies.

On-going post-employment training is needed for all who work in community rehabilitation programs to achieve improved
employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, especially volunteers, providers, and employers who fill
key roles in staffing, directing, and using these programs. 
In the past, RSA funded many nonacademic training programs that maintain or upgrade the skills of currently employed
individuals in community rehabilitation programs under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program. However,
final regulations for the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program 
(59 FR 31060) focus on the support of academic programs that award degrees or certificates. Therefore, support for
nonacademic training programs will be carried out under the other applicable training program authorities, such
as this Rehabilitation Continuing Education program, the Short-Term Training program, and the Experimental and
Innovative Training program. 
The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 


Priority


Projects must_
 Provide post-employment training for job coaches and other direct service community rehabilitation personnel,
including employers and co-workers of people with disabilities who provide support at work for persons with severe
disabilities (often called natural support), administrators, volunteers and peer counselors, and other personnel
of community rehabilitation programs; 
 Coordinate with activities supported by business and industry, State vocational rehabilitation agencies,
school-to-work transition projects, and job development centers funded by the National Institute on Disability
and Rehabilitation Research; 
 Provide seminars, forums, train-the-trainer training, technical assistance, and similar methods to meet
recurrent and common training needs of employed rehabilitation personnel throughout a multi-State geographical
area; and

Priorities


Proposed Priority 1_Personnel Specifically Trained to Deliver Services in Client Assistance Programs 




Background: 

The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-569) made significant changes in rehabilitation service
provisions under Title I of the Act. Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) provide assistance in informing and advising
all clients and applicants of available benefits under the Act. Section 302 of the Act includes personnel specifically
trained to deliver services in CAPs among the personnel that the Rehabilitation Training program must consider in
reviewing personnel shortages and training needs. Through the 1992 Survey of Personnel Shortages and Training Needs
in Vocational Rehabilitation, CAP directors have reported critical training needs for both CAP administrative
and service-delivery personnel. 
The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 


Priority


The project must_
 Provide training to CAP personnel on an as-needed basis, including_(1) Management training on skills needed
for strategic and operational planning and direction of CAP services; and (2) Consumer advocacy training on skills
and knowledge needed by CAP staff to assist persons with disabilities to gain access to and to use the services and benefits
available under the Rehabilitation Act, particularly new Title I requirements; 
 Coordinate training efforts with training supported by the Center for Mental Health Services and the Administration
on Developmental Disabilities for protection and advocacy on common areas, such as financial management; and 
 Include both national and regional training seminars in each project year. 


Proposed Priority 2_Training Rehabilitation and Mental Health Personnel to Provide Improved Rehabilitation Services
to Individuals With Mental Illness 




Background: 

High turnover rates and inadequate academic preparation of service staff are continuing problems among programs
providing rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness (Pratt and Gill, ``Developing Interagency
In-Service Training,'' 

Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal, 

Vol. 16, No. 1, July, 1992). Ongoing research has documented the need for competency-based training to promote the
recruitment, career development, and retention of personnel who provide support and rehabilitation services to
persons with mental illness (``A Comprehensive Study of Human Resource Development Issues_Present and Future_for
Personnel Providing Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services,'' Project No. H133G10072, awarded July 1, 1991, by
the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research to the International Association of Psychosocial
Rehabilitation Services). 
Provision of rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness is complicated by the need for staff to
interact frequently with professionals in other agencies and disciplines. Cross-training of counselors, psychiatrists,
psychologists, social workers, evaluators, and other professionals is essential to effective interagency cooperation.
Rehabilitation and related staff must be knowledgeable about key legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,
the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Social Security Act. Increasingly, rehabilitation services involve
persons with severe mental illness making their own choices and family members having a role in rehabilitation programs.
Staff require training to be effective in consumer-directed rehabilitation. 
The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months.

Projects must_
 Develop training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing personnel in providing mental health and
vocational rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness; 
 Disseminate training materials on organizational coordination, resources, and organizational linkages,
including findings from RSA-supported demonstration projects, that will enhance employment outcomes of individuals
with mental illness served by the programs of vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and independent
living; 
 Improve the skills of rehabilitation counselors, administrators, and related professionals, such as psychologists,
evaluators, and psychiatrists, in working with persons with mental illness disabilities in the development and
implementation of Individualized Written Rehabilitation Programs and vocational placements; 
 Develop instructional techniques for working with consumers and family members on problem-solving and decisionmaking
skills that will enhance employment outcomes; 
 Include information in curriculum materials on provisions of Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act that
are related to work incentives for individuals with disabilities and on employment-related provisions of the Americans
with Disabilities Act; 
 Provide training through special seminars, institutes, workshops, and other short-term courses in technical
matters relating to the delivery of rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness; 
 Provide training for three or more States; and 
 Demonstrate potential for replication based on project outcomes through the dissemination of training materials
and protocols. 


Proposed Priority 3_Training Members of American Indian Tribes, State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Staff,
and Rehabilitation Educators on Services for American Indians With Disabilities 




Background: 

The Act has a number of provisions that relate to the needs of American Indians with disabilities. Under section 101(a)(20),
States are required, as appropriate, to actively consult in the development of the State plan for vocational services
with American Indian tribes and tribal organizations and Native Hawaiian organizations. 
Section 101(a)(15) requires that States conduct continuing statewide studies of the needs of individuals with disabilities
and how these needs may be most effectively met, including outreach to minorities and those who have been unserved
or underserved. Vocational rehabilitation services are provided under section 130 of the Act to American Indians
residing on reservations. Under the Act, the term American Indians includes Eskimos and Aleuts. 
American Indians have one of the highest disability rates of all population groups. Yet, according to recent RSA statistical
data on the vocational rehabilitation program, when American Indians with disabilities receive vocational rehabilitation
services, they have a low rehabilitation success rate. 
Some of the major problems in providing services to American Indians include_(1) Lack of outreach efforts to rural
and isolated areas where many American Indians live; (2) Cultural differences that make use of standard rehabilitation
practices or methods less effective and may lead to lack of mutual understanding and trust between the provider and
recipient of services; (3) Language and communication barriers; and 
(4) Limited employment opportunities in rural areas and on reservations. 
These problems are being addressed, in part, through the American Indian vocational rehabilitation services (section
130) discretionary grants. Increased cooperative efforts and sharing of information have occurred as a result of
linkages between the discretionary projects and State rehabilitation agencies. There is a great need, however,
for training methods and materials to improve the provision of services to American Indians with disabilities. Rehabilitation
counselors and other staff who work in State rehabilitation agencies that serve high populations of American Indians
need training on how to work effectively with this population. In addition, institutions of higher education, which
prepare individuals to provide vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities, have
a need for culturally appropriate materials. 
The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. 


Priority


The project must_
 Develop, with the active participation of American Indians, culturally sensitive rehabilitation training
materials that address use of appropriate rehabilitation methods, cultural differences, and development of mutual
understanding and trust between service provider and recipient; 
 Use a ``train-the-trainer'' approach to train State rehabilitation unit in-service training educators
and rehabilitation educators on all materials developed in order to improve the skills and knowledge of personnel
providing vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities; 
 Conduct seminars and workshops for rehabilitation counselors and upper management rehabilitation administrators
in States with high American Indian populations on how to reach out to American Indians with disabilities, including
effective services planning in conjunction with section 130 American Indian vocational rehabilitation services
grants; 
 Provide training in State agencies with high American Indian populations; and

 Demonstrate potential for replication based on project outcomes through the dissemination of training materials
and protocols. 


Proposed Priority 4_Training Impartial Hearing Officers on Provisions of the Act 




Background: 

The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 contain several new requirements for due process applicable to State rehabilitation
agencies that provide services under Title I of the Act. For example, agency personnel shall presume that an applicant
can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services unless they can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
that the applicant is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment
outcome. If an individual with a disability is dissatisfied with an eligibility determination or other decisions
affecting the nature, scope, onset, duration, or other conditions of services, the applicant or recipient is entitled
to a fair hearing before an impartial hearing officer under section 102(d) of the Act. 
An impartial hearing officer is defined in section 7(28) of the Act. Among the qualifications, the impartial hearing
officer must have is knowledge of the delivery of vocational rehabilitation services, the State plan for rehabilitation
services, and the Federal and State regulations governing the provision of services. Hearing officers are required
in section 102(d)(2)(C) of the Act to be qualified to perform their official duties. 
One problem in training hearing officers is that there is a lack of an organized and accessible information base of
hearing decisions and appeals such as is commonly found in our judicial system. Those compilations relate hearing
decisions to State administrative case law, encourage the use of precedent in hearing decisions, provide evaluative
data to State agencies on policies and practices that require revision or remediation, and provide information for
use by the Federal Government in its monitoring responsibilities. A digest of hearing decisions and appeals, if published
nationally, would also be of great benefit to multiple agencies, constituent groups, and Client Assistance Programs.

The Secretary intends to make an award with
