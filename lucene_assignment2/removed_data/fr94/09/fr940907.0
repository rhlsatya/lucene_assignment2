Milk in the Eastern Colorado Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document suspends certain performance standards of the Eastern Colorado Federal milk marketing order. The
action was proposed by Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., a cooperative association that supplies milk for the market's
fluid needs. The suspension will make it easier for handlers to qualify milk for pool status and prevent uneconomic
milk movements that otherwise would be required to maintain pool status for milk of producers who have been historically
associated with the market.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 


Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued June 23, 1994; published June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33455). 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers who have been historically
associated with this market will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits
that accrue from such pricing. 
The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in 
connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted
from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary
would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the
handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's
ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the
order regulating the handling of milk in the Eastern Colorado marketing area. 
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33455) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons
were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. One comment supporting the proposed
action was filed. No opposing views were received. 
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provisions of the order do not tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 
1. For the months of September 1994 through February 1995: 
In the second sentence of  1137.7(b), the words ``plant which has qualified as a'' and ``of March through August'';
and

<TEXT>
 

2. For the months of September 1994 through August 1995: 
In the first sentence of  1137.12(a)(1), the words ``from whom at least three deliveries of milk are received
during the month at a distributing pool plant''; and in the second sentence, the words ``30 percent in the months of
March, April, May, June, July, and December and 20 percent in other months of'', and the word ``distributing''. 


Statement of Consideration 


This action suspends certain portions of the ``pool plant'' and ``producer'' definitions of the Eastern Colorado
order (Order 137). The suspension will make it easier for handlers to qualify milk for pooling under the order. 
The suspension action was requested by Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), a cooperative association that has
pooled milk of dairy farmers under Order 137 for several years. Mid-Am requested the suspension to prevent the uneconomic
and inefficient movement of milk for the sole purpose of pooling the milk of producers who have been historically associated
with the order. 
For the months of September 1994 through February 1995, the restriction on the months when automatic pool plant status
applies for supply plants will be removed. For the months of September 1994 through August 1995, the touch-base requirement
will not apply and the diversion allowance for cooperatives will be raised. 
These provisions have been suspended in prior years to maintain the pool status of producers who have historically
supplied the fluid needs of Order 137 distributing plants. The marketing conditions which justified the prior suspensions
continue to exist. 
Mid-Am asserts that they have made a commitment to supply the fluid milk requirements of distributing plants if their
suspension request is granted. Without the suspension, to qualify certain of its milk for pooling it would be necessary
for the cooperative to ship milk from distant farms to Denver-area bottling plants. The distant milk would displace
milk produced on nearby farms that would then have to be shipped from the Denver area to manufacturing plants located
in outlying areas. 
There are ample supplies of locally-produced milk that can be delivered directly from farms to distributing plants
to meet the market's fluid needs without requiring shipments from supply plants. Also, neither the elimination of
the touch-base requirement for producers nor the increase in the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants
by a cooperative should jeopardize the needs of the market's fluid processors. 
This suspension is found to be necessary for the purpose of assuring that producers' milk will not have to be moved in
an uneconomic and inefficient manner to ensure that producers whose milk has long been associated with the Eastern
Colorado marketing area will continue to benefit from pooling and pricing under the order. 
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who
have historically supplied the market without the need for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; 
(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. One comment supporting the suspension was filed. No opposing
views were received. 
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its policies and procedures governing debt settlement of Community
Programs loans. These changes are necessary to comply with Section 2384, Title XXIII, of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,
and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-624). This law is to establish and implement a program that is similar to the
program established under Section 353 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2001), except
that the debt restructuring and loan servicing procedures shall apply to delinquent Community Facility hospital
or health care program loans rather than Farmer Program loans. The intended effect is to keep these facilities in operation
with manageable debt.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 


Classification 


This rule has been determined to be significant/economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 


Environmental Impact Statement 


This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has
determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190), an
Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 


Executive Order 12778 


This regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in
sections 2(a) and (2)(b)(2) of that E.O. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B, must be exhausted prior to filing suit. 


Intergovernmental Review 


This action affects the following FmHA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: No. 10.766
Community Facility Loans. This program is subject to the provisions of E.O. 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983, 49 FR 2267, May
31, 1984, 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985.) 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575-0124
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This final rule does not revise or impose any new information
collection requirements from those approved by OMB. 


Background Information 


Section 2384 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-624, amended the Consolidated
Farm and Rural Development Act and requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a debt restructuring and loan
servicing program for FmHA hospital or health care facility borrowers. This program is similar to the loan restructuring
and servicing program in effect for delinquent Farmer Program loans. This rule amends current FmHA regulations to
implement this program. The program is intended to facilitate the continued operation of rural hospitals and health
care facilities by implementing all possible debt restructuring options available that will result in an economically
viable facility. 
Given the congressional intent to provide rural hospitals and health care facilities a debt restructuring option
similar to that provided Farmer Program borrowers, this regulation is modeled in a general sense on the Farmer Program
restructuring scheme. Under this regulation, a hospital or health care debtor who is delinquent on its FmHA loan,
and is unable to cure its delinquency through more traditional servicing methods, will be notified of the options
available for debt restructuring. The debtor can apply for consideration by providing financial and operational
information and proposing its own plan for curing the delinquency. 
In order to be eligible for consideration for debt restructuring, the debtor's delinquency must have been caused
by factors outside the debtor's control. In addition, the debtor must have acted in good faith with regard to the FmHA
loan. FmHA will make these determinations based on the debtor's representation and the Agency's review of other documents
relevant to these preliminary matters. 
Once the debtor provides the financial and operational information required, FmHA will conduct a thorough analysis
of the debtor's operations. This analysis will typically include contracting for an independent appraisal of the
collateral securing the loan and contracting with an independent expert to prepare an ``operations review.'' This
review will provide FmHA with information regarding the facility's operations, its financial standing, and suggest
alternatives that could be implemented to address the delinquency.

Using the information obtained from these sources and in consultation with the debtors and the experts, FmHA will
calculate two values as required by the statute. First, FmHA will determine the loan's ``net recovery'' value. This
value represents the current value of the loan if FmHA were to foreclose. Generally, the value is calculated by adding
the value of assets securing the loan and subtracting the costs that would be incurred if the loan was foreclosed. Second,
FmHA will determine the value of the restructured loan. This value is determined after a proposed plan is developed
for the operation of the facility. That is, the operation and/or debt is modified to determine if the debtor can attain
a positive cash flow and pay an adjusted debt service payment plus fund the FmHA Reserve Account. 
After the restructured loan value and the net recovery value are calculated, FmHA can determine whether the debtor's
request for debt restructuring can be approved. As required by the statute, FmHA can approve debt restructuring only
if the value of the restructured loan is greater than, or equal to, the net recovery value. Once the Agency reaches this
conclusion, the debtor will be notified of the results and given its options. If possible, the debt will be restructured
and the facility will continue operations. If the net recovery value is greater than the value of the restructured
loan, the debtor may choose to pay off the loan at the reduced net recovery value. If this option is not chosen, the loan
likely will be accelerated. 
Finally, if the debtor's debt is restructured or if the debtor elects to pay off the debt at the net recovery value, then
the debtor will be required to execute an Appreciation Recapture Agreement. As explained in the statute, these Agreements
allow the Agency to recoup a part or all of the debt that is written down if the debtor's underlying collateral appreciates
in value over time and if the debtor sells the collateral within 10 years. 


Discussion of Comments 


On January 13, 1993, a proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 4095) providing for a 30-day review and comment period ending February 12, 1993. Six comments were received.

Several respondents stated that the $300,000 limit on the writedown would not be enough to help many debtors and recommended
that the rule be amended to remove the writedown limit. The rule is amended to remove the $300,000 limit. The writedown
will be limited to the minimum amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt. 
One respondent recommended that the interest rate available under the Rural Rental Housing program, Section 8, which
permits loans at rates as low as 1 percent, be extended to include health care facilities located in designated health
professional shortage areas. Since FmHA's program regulations do not permit a reduction of interest rates below
the poverty line interest rate, FmHA will not reduce the interest rate further. 
Since publication of the proposed rule, the poverty line interest rate for FmHA and RDA loans changed from 5.0 percent
to 4.5 percent. The final rule was changed to reference FmHA Instruction 440.1, Exhibit B, Interest Rates, for FmHA
and RDA loans instead of using 5.0 percent. 
The loan servicing options available through this action will result in debt restructuring packages which will provide
significant benefit to all rural areas. 
One respondent recommended that the definition of net recovery value be expanded to consider the potential net loss
to the community if the facility were sold. 
The definition of net recovery value presently emphasizes that the value of the assets should be calculated based
upon the facility continuing to operate as a going concern, not merely as an empty building but as a facility continuing
to offer health care services to the community it serves. This value can be based on the facility offering health care
services which may, or may not, be similar to those offered by the current operators. This is the most practical and
accurate method of determining the net recovery value of the facility. 
One respondent recommended that we add the availability of writedown to servicing regulations without a mandate
for a strict servicing regimen to be initiated as soon as a debtor reaches the delinquency time limitations. This respondent
stated that a hospital could be offered net recovery buy out and not have the ability to obtain the buy out financing,
at which point the Government would be forced to accelerate the loan. 
FmHA is concerned about maintaining health care in rural areas. There is language in the rule which allows the Agency
discretion in such cases. The program is intended to facilitate the continued operation of rural hospitals and health
care facilities. 
One respondent recommended a waiver of the $300,000 writedown limit when dealing with facilities in designated health
professional shortage areas, those which are Medicare waivered acute-care facilities, alternate rural health
care delivery models, or facilities associated with related programs that may be approved by appropriate State licensing
agencies. 
As stated above, the $300,000 writedown limit has been removed. 
Therefore, the final rule is changed from the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 13, 1993, as follows: 

Debt writedown. 

A one-time reduction of the debt owed to FmHA including principal and interest. This reduction will be the minimum
amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt.

<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Definitions. 

As used in this section, the following definitions apply: 


Consolidation. 

The combining of two or more debt instruments into one instrument, normally accompanied by reamortization. 


Debt writedown. 

A one-time reduction of the debt owed to FmHA including principal and interest. This reduction will be the minimum
amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt. The writedown will be applied first
to interest and then principal. 


Delinquency due to circumstances beyond the control of the debtor. 

Includes situations such as: The debtor has less money than planned due to unexpected and uncontrollable events such
as unexpected loss of service area population, unforeseeable costs incurred for compliance with State or Federal
regulatory requirements, or the loss of key personnel. 


Delinquent debtor. 

For purposes of this section, delinquency is defined as being 180 days behind schedule on the FmHA payments. That is,
one full annual installment or the equivalent for monthly, quarterly, or semiannual installments. 


Eligibility. 

Applicants must be delinquent due to circumstances beyond their control and have acted in good faith by trying to fulfill
the agreements with FmHA in connection with the delinquent loans. 


Interest rate reduction. 

Reduction of the interest rate on the restructured loan to as low as the poverty line interest rate in effect on community
and business programs loans. 


Loan deferral. 

The temporary delay of principal and interest payments for up to 6 months. The debtor must be able to demonstrate the
ability to pay the debt, as restructured, at the end of this delay period. 


Net recovery value. 

A calculation of the net value of the collateral and other assets held by the debtor. This value would be determined
by adding the fair market value of FmHA's interest in any real property pledged as collateral for the loan, plus the
value of any other assets pledged or otherwise available for the repayment of the debt, minus the anticipated administrative
and legal expenses that would be incurred in connection with the liquidation of the loan. This value of the assets should
be calculated based upon the facility continuing to operate as a going concern. Therefore, the facility should be
valued not merely as an empty building but as a facility continuing to offer health care services which may, or may not,
be similar to those offered by the current operators. 


Operations review. 

A study of management and business operations of the facility by an independent expert. For example, a study of a hospital
and nursing home would include such areas as: general and administrative, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, nursing,
physical plant, social services, income potential, Federal, State, and insurance payments, and rate analysis.
Also, recommendations and conclusions are to be included in the study which would indicate the creditworthiness
of the facility and its ability to continue as a going concern. In analyzing a debtor's proposed restructuring plan,
FmHA may contract for the completion of an operations review. These reviews will be developed by individuals and entities
who have demonstrated an expertise in the analysis of health care facilities from an operational and administrative
standpoint. FmHA will consider the following criteria for selection: past experience in health care facility analysis,
a familiarity with the problems of rural health care facilities, a knowledge of the particular area currently served
by the facility in question, and a willingness to work with both FmHA and the debtor in developing a final plan for restructuring.



Restructured loan. 

A revision of the debt instruments including any combination of the following: writing down of accumulated interest
charges and principal, deferral, consolidation, and adjustment of the interest rates and terms, usually followed
by reamortization. 
(b) 

Debtor notification. 

All servicing actions permitted under subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter are to be exhausted prior to consideration
for debt restructuring under this section. To this end, the servicing official must ensure that the casefile clearly
documents that all servicing actions under subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter have been exhausted and that the debtor
is at least 1 full year's debt service behind schedule for a minimum of 180 days. The debtor then should be informed of
the debt restructuring available under this section by using language similar to that provided in Guide 1 of this subpart
(available in any FmHA Office) as follows: 
(1) Any introductory paragraph; 
(2) A paragraph concerning prior servicing attempts; 
(3) A discussion of eligibility, as defined in this section, including the provision that the debtor acted in good
faith in connection with their FmHA loan and that the delinquency was caused by circumstances beyond their control;

(4) Two paragraphs that explain the goal of the debt restructuring program; 
(5) A paragraph stating that debt restructuring may include a combination of servicing actions listed in paragraph
(a) of this section; 
(6) Information that details what the debtor must do to apply for restructuring. A response must be received within
45 days of receipt of this letter to request consideration for debt restructuring and the request must include projected
balance sheets, budgets, and cash-flow statements which include and clearly identify funding of the FmHA reserve
account for the next 3 years; 
(7) A discussion of FmHA's analysis and calculation process; and 
(8) A paragraph identifying the FmHA official who may be contacted for assistance. 
(c) 

State Director's restructuring determination. 

Upon receipt of the delinquent debtor's request for debt restructuring consideration, the State Director will:

(1) Within 15 days of receipt of debtor's request, if an operations review is deemed necessary, send a memorandum to
the Administrator asking for program authority to contract for the review in accordance with Exhibit D of FmHA Instruction
2024-A (available in any FmHA Office). The name of the debtor involved and the projected amount of funds anticipated
to be spent for the contract should also be provided. It is anticipated that an operations review will be necessary
in most cases and that the only exceptions would be for smaller health care facilities or facilities that have developed
a proposed plan that is comprehensive and realistic. Upon receipt of the Administrator's program contracting approval
authority, a contract is to be awarded to an organization qualified to perform an operations review as defined in paragraph
(a) of this section. The operations review normally will be completed and delivered to FmHA within 60 days of the award
date. 
(2) Contract for an appraisal to be performed by an independent, qualified fee appraiser. Note: To the extent possible,
the appraisal should be scheduled for completion no later than the completion date of the operations review. 
(3) Complete an analysis of the operations review, appraisal, and other documented information, and make an eligibility
determination. 
(i) Eligibility determination. The State Director must conclude that the debtor is eligible for debt restructuring
consideration. This conclusion will be clearly documented in the casefile based on a review of the following:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-0-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) The debtor acted in good faith with regard to the delinquent loan. The casefile must reflect the debtor's cooperation
in exploring servicing alternatives. The casefile should contain no evidence of fraud, waste, or conversion by the
debtor, and no evidence that the debtor violated the loan agreement or FmHA regulations. 
(B) The delinquency was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the debtor. This determination will be based
on the debtor's narrative on this issue, which is a required part of the application for debt restructuring, and a separate
review of the debtor's casefile and operations. 
(C) As part of the application for debt restructuring, the debtor submitted a proposed operating plan that presents
feasible alternatives for addressing the delinquency. 
(ii) 

Debtor determined eligible. 

If the debtor is determined to be eligible for debt restructuring, a determination of a net recovery value and level
of debt the facility will support will be made. It is anticipated that meetings with the debtor, the contractor who
performed the operations review, and others, as appropriate, could be necessary to develop these values; although
it should be emphasized throughout these meetings that any calculations and conclusions reached are preliminary
in nature, pending final review by the Administrator. For debt restructuring calculations and computing a feasible
cash-flow projection, the following order and combinations of loan servicing actions will be followed: 
(A) Loan deferral for up to 6 months. 
(B) Interest rate reduction to not less than the poverty line rate as determined by FmHA Instruction 440.1, exhibit
B (available in any FmHA Office). Interest rate reduction will be considered only in conjunction with an extension
of the term of the loan to the remaining useful life of the facility or 40 years, whichever is less. 
(C) Debt writedown. Other creditors of the debtor, representing a substantial portion of the total debt, are expected
to participate in the development of a restructuring plan which includes debt writedown. Debt writedown participation
by other creditors should be on a pro rata basis with the FmHA writedown. However, failure of these creditors to agree
to participate in the plan shall not preclude the use of principal and interest writedown by FmHA if it is determined
that this option results in the least cost to the Federal Government. 
(iii) 

Debtor determined ineligible. 

If the State Director concludes that the debtor is not eligible for debt restructuring consideration for any of the
reasons listed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, then the debtor will be notified by a letter that includes the
following information: 
(A) The basis for the determination; 
(B) The next step in servicing the loan: possible acceleration if the delinquency is not cured; and 
(C) The debtor may appeal this determination in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. 
(iv) 

State Director's recommendation. 

Upon completion of the determination of net recovery value and restructured debt in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii)
of this section, and prior to formal presentation to the borrower, the State Director will forward a recommendation
to the National Office with the following documentation: 
(A) That all other servicing efforts have been exhausted as required in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(B) Financial statements including balance sheets, income and expense, cash-flows for the most recent actual year,
and projections for the next 3 years. The amount of FmHA's restructured debt and reserve account requirements are
to be clearly indicated on the projected statements. Also, operating statistics including number of beds, patient

(A) The debtor may pay FmHA the net recovery value of the loan. The debtor will be given 30 days from receipt of this letter
to inform FmHA of its intent, 90 days to finalize the payoff, and will be notified that an election to pay off FmHA would
require the execution of a Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement, similar to that provided in Guide 5 of this subpart
(available in any FmHA Office); or 
(B) If the debt is not paid off at the net recovery value, FmHA will proceed to liquidate the loan. 
(f) 

Debtor responses to debt restructuring and net recovery value calculations. 

Responses from the debtor will be handled as follows: 
(1) 

Acceptance of FmHA's restructured debt offer. 

When a debtor accepts the offer for debt restructuring, processing will be in accordance with  1951.223 (c)
of subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter using the adjusted unpaid principal and outstanding accrued interest at the
Administrator's approved interest rate and terms. The debtor will be required to execute a Shared Appreciation Agreement
which will provide that, should the debtor sell or transfer title to the facility within the next 10 years, FmHA is entitled
to a portion of any gain realized. This agreement will include language similar to that found in Guide 4 of this subpart
(available in any FmHA Office). The original of Form FmHA 1956-1, with appropriate attachments signed by the
State Director, and a copy of the Shared Appreciation Agreement will be sent to the Finance Office. Note: All documents
pertaining to this transaction will be sent to the Finance Office in one single complete package; and 
(2) 

Acceptance by debtor to pay off loan at the recovery value. 

Processing of this transaction will be in accordance with  1956.124 of this subpart. However, the account does
not need to be accelerated. The debtor will be required to execute a Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement, similar
to that found in Guide 5 of this subpart (available in any FmHA Office). The original of Form FmHA 1956-1, with
appropriate attachments signed by the State Director, and a copy of the recorded Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement
will be sent to the Finance Office. The executed Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement will be recorded in the county
in which the facility is located. The Finance Office will credit the accounts of debtors who entered into Net Recovery
Buy Out Recapture Agreements with the amount paid by the debtor (net recovery value). Note: All documents pertaining
to this transaction will be sent to the Finance Office in one single complete package. 
(g) 

Collection and processing of recapture. 
(1) When FmHA becomes aware of the sale or transfer of title to the facility on which there is an effective Net Recovery
Buy Out Recapture 
Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) or a Shared Appreciation Agreement (Guide 4 of this
subpart available in any FmHA Office) outstanding and a determination is made that a recapture is appropriate, FmHA
will notify the debtor of the following: 
(i) Date and amount of recapture due; and 
(ii) FmHA action to be taken if debtor does not respond within the designated timeframe with the amount of recapture
due. 
(2) When the recapture is received, the payment will be processed on Form FmHA 451-2 as a miscellaneous collection
in accordance with subpart B of part 1951 of this chapter. The Form FmHA 451-2 along with a copy of the Net Recovery
Buy Out Recapture Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office) or Shared Appreciation Agreement
(Guide 4 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office), as appropriate, will be forwarded to the Finance Office. 
(3) When the amount of the recapture has been paid and credited to the debtor's account, the debtor will be released
from liability by using Form FmHA 1965-8, ``Release from Personal Liability,'' modified as appropriate. 
(h) No recapture due. 

If FmHA determines there is no recapture due, the Net Recovery Buy Out Recapture Agreement (Guide 5 of this subpart
available in any FmHA Office) or Shared Appreciation Agreement (Guide 4 of this subpart available in any FmHA Office)
will be appropriately annotated, the Recapture Agreement released from the record, and the Agreement returned to
the debtor. 
4. Section 1956.147 is amended by revising the word ``borrower'' to read ``debtor'' in paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and
(a)(3)(v)(B). 
5. Section 1956.150 is revised to read as follows: 


 1956.150

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369, 369A (OH-6A),
369D, E, F, FF, H, HE, HS, and HM Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter
Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369, 369A (OH-6A), 369D, E, F, FF, H, HE, HS, and HM series helicopters,
that requires daily preflight checks and 100 hours time-in-service (TIS) inspections for tail rotor blade abrasion
strip (abrasion strip) debonding until abrasion strip rivets (rivets) are installed. This amendment also supersedes
a Priority Letter AD that currently requires installation of rivets, corrects tail rotor blade part numbers listed
in the previous AD, and retains the daily preflight checks of the previous AD until rivets are installed to secure the
abrasion strip. This AD provides a terminating action for the abrasion strip debonding and also seeks to clear up any
confusion among operators caused by having a published AD and a Priority Letter that are applicable to the same helicopter
part. This AD replaces both of those documents. This amendment is prompted by an accident resulting from the separation
of an abrasion strip from a tail rotor blade and subsequent tail rotor separation. The actions specified by this AD
are intended to prevent loss of the abrasion strip, separation of the tail rotor, and subsequent loss of control of
the helicopter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 31, 1991, the FAA issued AD 92-02-15, Amendment 39-8151 (57 FR 5379, February 14, 1992),
to require daily preflight checks and 100 hours TIS repetitive inspections for abrasion strip debonding until rivets
are installed. That AD requires installation of the rivets within 300 hours TIS. 


As a result of a more recent helicopter accident involving the separation of an abrasion strip, on October 16, 1992,
the FAA issued Priority Letter (PL) AD 92-22-14 that superseded the existing AD 92-02-15.
The PL AD corrects certain tail rotor blade part numbers as listed in AD 92-02-15 and retains the daily preflight
checks of the previous AD 92-02-15 until rivets are installed. The PL AD further requires installation
of the rivets within 25 hours TIS or within 7 days, whichever comes first. 
Both AD 92-02-15, issued December 31, 1991 and the PL AD 92-22-14, issued October 16, 1992,
require a visual check for evidence of debonding before the first flight of each day. However, AD 92-02-15
requires installation of rivets within 300 hours TIS while PL AD 92-22-14 requires installation of the
rivets within 25 hours TIS or on or before 7 days after the effective date of that AD. Both of these ADs require the same
corrective action but have different compliance times. Additionally, the PL AD did not specify whether the 7-day
compliance time was in terms of ``work'' days or ``calendar'' days. As a result of having two ADs that require the same
corrective action with only differing compliance times, and additionally failing to specifically describe the
type of compliance day as that term was used in the PL AD, operators may be confused about when compliance is required.
Such confusion may lead an operator to inadvertently fail to comply with the necessary safety requirements for these
rotorcraft and result in an unsafe condition. Therefore, due to the criticality of the abrasion strip, the short compliance
times, and the possible confusion as a result of having two effective ADs that require the same corrective action with
one containing a potentially confusing compliance time, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe
condition. 
In addition to correcting the unsafe conditions described, this AD also provides that installation of the rivets
to secure the abrasion strip constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. 
The checks required by this AD before the first flight of each day may be performed by an owner/operator (pilot) but
must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417
(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. This AD allows a pilot to perform this check because it involves only
a visual check for debonding of the abrasion strip from the tail rotor blade and is required only until rivets are installed.
This check can be performed equally well by a pilot or a mechanic. It involves checking items similar to those items
that a pilot checks during a preflight. Safety does not require that this check be performed by a mechanic before the
first flight of each day. The AD does require that a mechanic inspect the tail rotor blades within 25 hours TIS or within
7 calendar days, whichever occurs first. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type
design, this AD supersedes the PL, AD 92-22-14, and AD 92-02-15 to require more prompt installation
of rivets, to specify that the 7 days compliance time refers to calendar days, and to correct tail rotor blade part numbers
as listed in AD 92-02-15. The daily preflight checks required by paragraph (a) of AD 92-02-15
are retained until rivets are installed. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with Part II of
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company Service Information Notice HN-232, DN-179, EN-70 and FN-57,
dated September 27, 1991. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-SW-03-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace areas at Erie, PA, Harrisburg, Capital City Airport, PA, Harrisburg International
Airport, PA, North Philadelphia, PA, and Williamsport, PA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with
the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when
the associated control tower is closed. Additionally, this action establishes Class E airspace areas at Lancaster,
PA, and Reading, PA. Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is
in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control tower located at this location
is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic
control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approaches when these control
towers are closed. Furthermore, minor technical amendments are being made to the Bradford, PA, and Du Bois, PA Class
E airspace areas to reflect the operational hours of the associated Flight Service Station.

Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the 

DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at
Harrisburg, Capital City Airport, PA, Harrisburg International Airport, PA, Erie, PA, North Philadelphia, PA,
and Williamsport, PA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours
of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed.
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports.
However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic
area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ's were continuous,
while the former ATA's were contingent upon the operation of the associated air traffic control tower. The consolidation
of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class
D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
during the hours the control tower is closed. Additionally, this action establishes Class E airspace areas at Lancaster,
PA, and Reading, PA. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation.
Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Lancaster, PA, and Reading, PA,
when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication
with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach
procedures when these control towers are closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).
Furthermore, the Class E airspace areas at Bradford, PA, and Du Bois, PA, are being revised to reflect the hours of the
associated Flight Service Station.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, and 6004, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 8, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote
the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Trenton, NJ



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Trenton, NJ. Presently, this area is designated as Class D airspace when
the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control
tower located at this location is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when the control tower is closed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace extending
upward from the surface at Trenton, NJ. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control
tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Mercer County
Airport, Trenton, NJ when the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for IFR operations at this airport when the control tower is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification
Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that
there is an immediate need to establish this Class E surface area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling
of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable
and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Alteration and Subdivision of Restricted Area R-2503 and Revocation of R-2533; California 



<AGENCY>

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action modifies Restricted Area R-2503, Camp Pendleton, CA, and subdivides the area into three separate
areas designated as R-2503A, R-2503B, and R-2503C. R-2503A will incorporate part of the existing
Restricted Area R-2533, Oceanside, CA. R-2533 will be removed concurrent with this action. This action
will allow Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton to accomplish required training. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 



On November 23, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by subdividing
Restricted Area R-2503, Camp Pendleton, CA, into three separate areas designated as R-2503A, R-2503B,
and R-2503C and by removing R-2533, Oceanside, CA (58 FR 61854). Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.
This action also corrects an inadvertent error that was published in the notice concerning the base commander's name
listed in the using agency. ``Commanding Officer'' should have been ``Commanding General.'' Except for the change
noted above, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Section 73.25 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 



The Rule 



This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations subdivides Restricted Area R-2503, Camp Pendleton,
CA, into three separate areas designated as R-2503A, R-2503B, and R-2503C. Camp Pendleton has found
that having two restricted areas with similar sounding, but different numbers is confusing, and has requested that
R-2533 be removed and modified under the designation of R-2503A. R-2503A is smaller in size than
the current R-2533. The southwestern boundary of R-2503A will be 2 miles closer to the shoreline so that
the distance that nonparticipating aircraft will need to fly offshore to avoid the area will be reduced. Additionally,
the boundary on the northwestern side of R-2503A will be adjusted to return airspace near San Clemente to the
public. R-2503B is a slightly enlarged version of the existing R-2503. The southwestern boundary will
be moved 1 mile toward the shoreline to enable the Marine Corps to provide requisite training. R-2503C is new
airspace which will extend from 15,000 to 27,000 feet and will overlie approximately three-fourths of R-2503B.
The Marine Corps has requested this additional airspace to accomplish required training, such as high angle, high
altitude artillery firing, and has indicated that its use will typically be less than 40 hours per year. A change to
the using agency to standardize format is also included in this action. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Environmental Review 



An Environmental Assessment (EA) of this action, resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), was completed
by the Environmental and Natural Resources Management Office, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, CA. The FAA has reviewed
the EA, and adopts the EA/FONSI, as supplemented by the Marine Corps. The FAA concludes that this action will have no
significant impact on the environment.

Indirect Food Additives: Polymers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers in repeated use food-contact articles. This action is in response to a petition
filed by Polysar Rubber Corp.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65907), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4299) had been filed by Polysar
Rubber Corp., 1265 South Vidal St., Sarnia, Ontario, Canada N7T 7MI. The petition proposed that the food additive
regulations be amended in  177.2600 

Rubber articles intended for repeated use

 (21 CFR 177.2600) to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers in repeated use
food-contact articles.


FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safety of the additive and the chemical impurities
that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of unreacted acrylonitrile, a carcinogenic
reactant used in the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as acrylonitrile,
are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives.



 I. Determination of Safety


 Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21
CFR 170.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
 The anticancer or Delaney clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be
deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause
applies to the additive itself and not to the impurities in the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been
shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive (

Scott

 v. 

FDA

 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)).


 II. Safety of Petitioned Use of the Additive


 FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive, hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer, will result
in exposure to the additive of no greater than 7 parts per trillion (ppt) in the daily diet (Ref. 1). 
 FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies on the additive. No adverse
effects were reported in these studies.
 FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by acrylonitrile, a carcinogenic
chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation of acrylonitrile has two aspects:
(1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolation of the risk
observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.


 A. Acrylonitrile


FDA has estimated the worst-case exposure to acrylonitrile from the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture
of repeated use food-contact articles to be 0.02 ppt of the daily diet (3 kilograms) or 0.06 nanogram (ng) per person
per day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from two carcinogenicity studies on acrylonitrile monomer fed to rats to estimate
the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of hydrogenated
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers and the level of acrylonitrile that may be present in the additive (Ref. 3).
The results of the bioassays on acrylonitrile monomer demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats under
the conditions of the studies. The test material caused significantly increased incidences of carcinogenic tumors
at many tissue sites.

 Based on the estimated worst-case exposure of 0.06 ng per person per day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit
of individual lifetime risk from the use of the hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers is 8 x 10

-11 

 or 8 in 100 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate,
the actual lifetime averaged individual daily exposure to acrylonitrile is expected to be substantially less than
the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limit of risk would be less. Thus, the agency
concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm from exposure to acrylonitrile would result from the proposed
use of hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers.


B. Conclusion on Safety


 FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive
in repeated use food-contact articles is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive
will have the intended technical effect. Therefore,  177.2600 should be amended as set forth below.


 C. Need for Specifications


 The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of acrylonitrile impurity
in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low level at which acrylonitrile may be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive,
the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2)
the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even under worst-case assumptions, is very
low, less than 8 in 100 billion.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


 III. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


 IV. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before October 7, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Drawbridge Operations Regulations; Pamunkey River, West Point, VA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is changing the regulations governing the operation of the Eltham drawbridge, SR 33, across Pamunkey
River, mile 1.0, located in West Point, Virginia, by restricting commercial fishing and crabbing vessels and recreational
vessels from opening the bridge between the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., 12 noon to 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The remaining
times those vessels are restricted to opening the bridge on the hour, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.



This is intended to provide for regulatory scheduled drawbridge openings to help reduce motor vehicle traffic delays
and congestion on the roads and highways linked by this drawbridge, while still providing for the reasonable needs
of navigation.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Bill H. Brazier, Project Officer, and LT Monica L. Lombardi,
Project Attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District.



Regulatory History



On May 20, 1994, the Coast Guard published a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Pamunkey River,
West Point, Virginia, in 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 25474). The comment period ended July 19, 1994. The Coast Guard received three letters commenting on the proposal.
Prior to publishing the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule, the Coast Guard also published Public Notice 5-818
and the original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Pamunkey River, West Point, Virginia, in 

Federal Register 

(58 FR 62303). The comment period ended January 10, 1994. The Coast Guard received 66 letters commenting on the proposal.



Background and Purpose



The original Notice of Proposed Rule announced that a proposal was being considered to restrict openings of the Eltham
Bridge to all vessels during morning, noon, and evening rush hours, between the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., 12 noon to 1
p.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday; except Federal holidays.

As a result of the proposed rule and the public notice, comments were received from the maritime community and the motoring
public. The motorists all were in favor of the proposed restrictions during peak traffic hours to reduce traffic disruption,
delays, congestion and minor accidents. The commercial marine industry was opposed to restricting the openings,
based on economic impact concerns, safety and tidal navigational requirements.

Following further investigation by the Coast Guard, it was determined that the major cause of traffic congestion
due to bridge lifts for the Eltham Bridge was contributed by commercial fisherman, crabbers and recreational boaters
requesting frequent bridge lifts during rush hour traffic periods. These mariners, for the most part, could pass
through without a bridge lift, by lowering their antennae. The remainder of the maritime industry, consisting of
piloted vessels and large tugs and barges, passing through this bridge is very sporadic. The bridge tender's logs
only reflected 4 or 5 bridge lifts per month for these vessels.

The Virginia Department of Transportation, in an effort to improve this situation, has requested these revised regulations.
It agreed to changing the original request by excluding larger classes of maritime vessels from the restrictions,
and to placing new restrictions on commercial fishing and crabbing vessels and recreational vessels which create
most of the problem.



Discussion of Comments and Change



The three comments received as a result of the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule issued by the District Commander
are all in favor of the new restrictions for the Eltham Bridge. No new or additional changes are being made to the regulatory
language of this final rule.



Regulatory Evaluation



This action is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The
economic impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.

This opinion is based on the fact that the regulations will not unduly cause a hardship on commercial/military vessels
who will be able to plan their vessel transits around the hours of restriction.



Small Entities



No comments were received concerning small entities or on the economic impact this rule would have on small entities.
Since the impact on these regulations is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. et seq.), that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

Even though commercial crabbers and small fishing vessel operators would be restricted under the proposed regulations,
the Coast Guard believes the proposed opening schedule for these operators is not unduly restrictive. These vessel
operators can still crab and fish, but they will have to time their requests for openings of the bridge to coincide with
the proposed new schedule. This should not cause any economic hardship. Because it expects the impact of this proposal
to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.).



Federalism 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

Safety Zone; Los Angeles Harbor-San Pedro Bay, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in two locations on the waters of San Pedro Bay, California. The event
requiring establishment of this safety zone is the dredging and landfill activities associated with the Port of Los
Angeles Pier 400 project. Duration of this project is estimated to be 33 months. There will be two separate safety zone
locations covered by this rulemaking. The first location, the site of the future Pier 400, is to the east of the Los Angeles
main channel, adjacent to Reservation Point. It encompasses anchorages B1-B3, B6-B8, C1-C3, and
C7-C9. The second location is to the southwest of the main channel which will transform anchorages Al-A5
into a permanent shallow water habitat as a mitigation measure for the Pier 400 landfill project. Entry into, transit
through, or anchoring within the safety zones by vessels other than those engaged in the construction of Pier 400 or
the development of the shallow water habitat is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
could not be done in a timely fashion in that the Coast Guard was not approached concerning the necessity for implementation
of a safety zone until later in the Pier 400 planning process. The actual stipulations of the safety zone were not finalized
until a date fewer than 30 days prior to the start of the project.





Although this regulation is published as an interim final rule without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment
is nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing
to comment may do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 

ADDRESSES 

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (COTP Los Angeles-Long Beach, CA; 94-004)
for the regulation and also include their name, address, and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting
acknowledgement of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Based upon the comments received, the scope of the regulation may be changed.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this notice are LCDR Chris Lockwood, project officer for the Captain of the Port, and Lieutenant Commander
Craig Juckniess, project attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District legal office.



Discussion of Regulation



The construction of the Pier 400 project is scheduled to begin on September 6, 1994. Safety zones are necessary to safeguard
recreational and commercial craft from the dangers of the dredging and landfill activities in the area and to prevent
interference with other vessels engaged in these operations. Persons and vessels are prohibited from entering into,
transiting through, or anchoring within the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Los Angeles-Long
Beach, CA.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Only minor delays to mariners is foreseen as vessel traffic is routed around
the construction areas.



Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612

ACTION:

 Final regulations.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the 
Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of 
Accrediting Agencies; State Postsecondary Review Programs; Federal Family Education Loan Program; and Endowment
Challenge Grant Program to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the
regulations. Those sections contain information collection requirements approved by OMB. The Secretary takes
this action to inform the public that these requirements have been approved.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 29, 1994, final regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies (59 FR 22250); State Postsecondary
Education Review Program (59 FR 22286); and Federal Family Education Loan Program (59 FR 22462). The final regulations
for the Endowment Challenge Grant Program were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1993 at 58 FR 11162. Compliance with the information collection requirements in these regulations
was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. OMB
approved the information collection requirements for the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition
of Accrediting Agencies and the State Postsecondary Education Review Program on July 1, 1994. The information collection
requirements for the Federal Family Education Loan Program were approved by OMB on June 28, 1994. The Endowment Challenge
Grant Program information collection requirements were approved by OMB on May 25, 1993. 



Section 682.202 was inadvertently listed as containing information collection requirements in the notice of revised
effective date published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33682). This section was determined not to contain information collection requirements and
was correctly removed from the list of sections that contained information collection requirements subject to OMB
approval in the correction notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 8, 1994 (56 FR 29543). 



Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Emission Statement Implementation Plan for Florida



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is approving a revision to the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Florida through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Florida ozone
nonattainment areas: Duval County, Miami, and Tampa. The SIP was submitted on 
January 12, 1993, by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the
SIP for Florida.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A SIP revision was submitted by the State of Florida on January 12, 1993, to satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(B)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) (November 15, 1990). The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine
completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated
May 6, 1993, addressed to Mr. Howard Rhodes, Director, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, was sent
to FDEP indicating the submittal was administratively complete.



There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, compliance, and specific
source requirements detailed below.

A. 

SIP Revision Submission

. The FDEP submitted the Florida emission statement regulation on January 12, 1993, which meets the emission statement
requirement. 

B. 

Program Elements

. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability of the regulations,
a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources.
The emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information
is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. The Florida submittal meets these requirements.


C. 

Applicability

. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that states with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone require emission statement
data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(Marginal, Moderate, etc.). 

The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

X

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. The Florida submittal waives the emission statement requirement for sources
with less than 25 tons per year combined of actual plant-wide NOx and VOC emissions and has included calculations of
these emissions in their 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory.



Final Action


In this action, EPA is approving the Emission Statement SIP revision submitted by the State of Florida through the
FDEP on January 12, 1993. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial
and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective
November 7, 1994. However, if adverse or critical comments are received by October 7, 1994, this action will be withdrawn
and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the final action.
The second document will be the final rulemaking action which will address the comments received.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).)

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Georgia: Approval of Revisions to the State Implementation Plan




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves revisions to the Georgia State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) on November 17, 1993, for the purpose of implementing
a program of Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). This program is required in all ozone (O

3

) nonattainment areas designated as serious, severe, or extreme. The submitted revisions meet the plan requirements
for serious nonattainment areas of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA). The revisions were submitted by the State
of Georgia through the GA EPD for the Atlanta O

3

 nonattainment area. 
 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The CAA provides for classification of O

3

 nonattainment areas according to the severity of their O

3

 problem. On January 6, 1991, the thirteen (13) county Atlanta area was classified as a serious O

3

 nonattainment area and required to meet all of the nonattainment requirements of the CAA for serious areas. Pursuant
to the CAA, Georgia is required to adopt specific air quality control rules and incorporate them into the Georgia SIP.




The air quality planning and SIP requirements for O

3

 nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the CAA. Section 182 of the CAA
sets out a graduated control program for O

3

 nonattainment areas. Section 182(c)(1) requires areas serious and above to adopt and implement an enhanced monitoring
program. The program must require enhanced monitoring of ambient concentrations of O

3

, oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Each SIP for a serious nonattainment area shall contain measures to improve
the ambient monitoring of such air pollutants. 

On November 8, 1993, the State of Georgia submitted the Georgia SIP for PAMS and the Atlanta PAMS Network Description.
The SIP submittal meets the criteria required by 40 CFR 58.20 as amended February 12, 1993. In order to obtain more comprehensive
and representative data on O

3

 air pollution, the Georgia SIP revision requires enhanced monitoring for O

3

, NO

x

, monitoring for speciated non-methane VOC's, carbonyl sampling, and meteorological measurements (wind direction,
wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and solar radiation and upper air soundings).
The monitoring is to be accomplished through the establishment of a standard, isolated network of five (5) PAMS. 



Final Action 


EPA is approving the revision to the Georgia SIP requiring enhanced monitoring. This action is being taken without
prior proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However,
in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective November 7, 1994 unless, by October 7, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.

If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at 
this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective November 7, 1994.

The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments
enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective
of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)).

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.



SIP Actions


SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision requires
the State of Maryland to offer the public an opportunity to request a public hearing before issuing a permit to construct
certain sources. The intended effect of this action is to incorporate by reference into the federally-enforceable
SIP revised State regulations which meet current Federal requirements. This action is being taken under section
110 of the Clean Air Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 30, 1987, the State of Maryland submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The State's
submittal consists of revisions to the Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (COMAR) 26.11.02.10C. regarding
action on a permit application and approval of new sources. At the time of submittal, the official State citation for
this amendment was COMAR 10.18.02.03H. However, the State recodified its air pollution regulations in 1988, and
EPA approved this recodification scheme as a SIP revision on November 3, 1992 (57 FR 49651). One of the revisions associated
with EPA's approval of the Maryland's recodification pertained to the transfer of the air permitting program from
the Departement of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to the Department of the Environment (MDE). Therefore, EPA will
address these amendments in terms of the current COMAR citations and the permitting authority currently vested with
MDE. 

Description of Revisions



The revisions to COMAR 26.11.02.10C. offers the public the opportunity to request a public hearing before the State
may issue a permit to construct for any of the following scenarios: Any source will be required to obtain a permit to
operate under COMAR 26.11.02.04 (formerly COMAR 10.18.02.03B.), any source subject to the Federal standards under
40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards (NSPS]), 40 CFR part 61 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP)), or 40 CFR 52.21 (Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)), any stationary source
of lead (Pb) that discharges 100 tons per year or more of lead or lead compounds measured as elemental lead (Pb), any
source that discharges 100 tons per year or more for any pollutant, and any new source impacting on a nonattainment
area (NSINA). (Note: Effective April 26, 1993, Maryland has replaced the term ``NSINA'' with ``new source review''
(``NSR''). EPA will formally incorporate this revised term into the Maryland SIP in a separate rulemaking action.)


The revised provisions to COMAR 26.11.02.10C. will be implemented by following certain procedures. If the MDE makes
a preliminary determination to issue a permit or approval, the applicant will publish an advertisement in a newspaper
in the area of concern which will allow 10 days for the public to request a public hearing and 30 days for public comment.
If the MDE receives a request for a public hearing, the MDE will schedule a hearing. A notice of the hearing will be published
in a newspaper in the area of concern at least 30 days in advance of the hearing. If a public hearing is held, the MDE must
issue the permit or approval within 60 days after the conclusion of the public hearing, except that the department
must issue the permit or approval within five working days after the conclusion of the public hearing if no information
is presented that would affect the issuance of the permit or approval. These provisions are codified at COMAR 26.11.02.10C.(1)
through 26.11.02.10C.(9). (Note: On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40060), EPA had approved a revision to the Maryland SIP which
cross-references 40 CFR 52.21 as amended through 1989. This revision is codified in the Maryland SIP at 40 CFR 52.1070(c)(95).)
If the permit or approval is to be denied, it must be done within 60 days after receiving all information necessary to
act on the application. (COMAR 26.11.02.10D, 26.11.02.10E). 

As required by 40 CFR 51.102, the State of Maryland certified that, after adequate public notice, a public hearing
was held on September 30, 1986 concerning the revisions to COMAR 26.11.02.10C.
 

EPA Evaluation



The implementation of revised COMAR 26.11.02.10C. will have no adverse economic impact on the State or local agencies.
Similarly, the amendment will have no direct impact on air quality because it only addresses procedural matters such
as the opportunity for public hearing and does not affect any air quality standards. The amendment will give the public
more opportunity to learn about and potentially influence the MDE's decisions on the issuance of permits. The specific
public participation requirements found in revised COMAR 26.11.02.10C. are consistent with those found in 40 CFR
51.160 and 51.161.



Final Action 



EPA is approving the revisions to COMAR 26.11.02.10C. as a revision to the Maryland SIP. The Agency has also reviewed
this SIP revision request for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 amendments enacted on November 15, 1990,
and has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal
preceded the date of enactment.

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective November 7, 1994 unless, by October 7, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 

If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on November 7, 1994.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact
on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation
of a flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The
Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.
 Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve revisions to
COMAR 26.11.02.10C. governing Maryland's public participation requirements before issuing construction permits
to certain sources must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994.
Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this
rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may
be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland; Volatile Organic Compound RACT Fix-ups,
Including Test Methods




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This submittal consists
of revised volatile organic compound (VOC) regulations applicable in the Baltimore nonattainment area, including
Baltimore City and the Counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, and Howard and the Washington, DC nonattainment
area, including Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. The intended effect of this action is to approve Maryland's
revised VOC regulations to correct deficiencies in Maryland's ozone SIP. This action is being taken under the Clean
Air Act (the Act).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland.
The formal SIP revision was submitted by Maryland on September 20, 1991, April 2, 1992, and January 18, 1993. The NPR
proposed approval of revisions to Maryland's ozone SIP to EPA as a SIP revision to comply with part of the reasonably
available control technology (RACT) fix-up requirement of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 (the Amendments).



Maryland's September 20, 1991 submittal consisted of the addition of COMAR 26.11.19.16 and Technical Memorandum
91-01 (TM 91-01), and revisions and additions to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.08,
26.11.10, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.14, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.11, 26.11.19.12. On April 2, 1992, Maryland
submitted further revisions to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.10, 26.11.13.04, 26.11.13.05,
26.11.14, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.09, and 26.11.19.12, and TM 91-01. On June 17, 1992 Maryland submitted a letter
to EPA withdrawing the capture efficiency protocols (Method 1003 of TM 91-01) from its September 20, 1991 SIP
revision submittal. However, on January 18, 1993 Maryland formally resubmitted TM 91-01 to EPA as a SIP revision.
This January 18, 1993 submittal also included amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.13.04, 26.11.13.05,
and 26.11.19.07, and 26.11.19.15.

Revisions to COMAR 26.11.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.08, 26.11.10, and 26.11.14, which are not related to VOCs, are addressed
by separate rulemaking actions. Revisions to COMAR 26.11.13.04 and 26.11.19.15 also are the subject of separate
rulemaking actions (58 FR 8565).

This rulemaking action is approving the addition of Appendixes A and B and Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008,
1009, 1011, and 1012 contained in TM 91-01 and COMAR 26.11.19.16 into the Maryland SIP, as well as amendments
to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.13.05, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.11,
and 26.11.19.12, which were proposed for approval on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028). Specifically, this action
is approving the following revisions to the Maryland ozone SIP:

 

(1) Amendments to the definition of the term ``volatile organic compound (VOC)'' to reflect current EPA guidance
and to update citations (COMAR 26.11.01.01DD);

(2) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.04C to delete a reference to Maryland's old technical memorandum and add a reference
to: (1) Maryland's Technical Memorandum 91-01 (TM-91-01), 

Test Methods and Equipment Specifications for Stationary Sources

, (January, 1991) as amended by Supplements 1 and 2 (July 1, 1991 and July 1, 1992, respectively); and (2) all EPA test
methods contained in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 1990 edition;

(3) The addition of test methods applicable to VOC regulations: Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009,
1011, and 1012 and Appendices A and B contained in TM 91-01;

(4) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.13.02C(2), Maryland's storage tank regulation to exempt storage tanks with liquid
mounted seals from the secondary seal requirement for consistency with the applicable control techniques guideline
(CTG);

(5) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.13.05B(2) and 26.11.13.05C(2) to delete specific references to the EPA approved test
methods and replace the old reference with references to COMAR 26.11.01.04C. 
 
(6) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.02D, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.12F to delete references to Maryland's old technical
memorandum and replace the old references with references to COMAR 26.11.01.04C.

(7) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.07A to add definitions for the terms sheet-fed paper coating and ultraviolet curable
coating.

(8) Addition of new COMAR 26.11.19.07D, a RACT regulation for sheet-fed paper coating. Sheet-fed paper coating is
a source category for which EPA has not issued a CTG, a so called ``non-CTG'' source category.

(9) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.11B and C to clarify the applicability of this miscellaneous printing and coating
regulation.

(10) Addition of new COMAR 26.11.19.16, which contains VOC leak detection and repair requirements. This regulation
applies to persons subject to any VOC regulation in COMAR 26.11.19 and not subject to a more specific leak requirement.

Other specific requirements of these revisions, and the rationale for EPA's action are explained in the NPR and will
not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. 


Final Action


EPA is approving the addition of Appendices A and B and Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1011, and 1012
contained in TM 91-01 and COMAR 26.11.19.16 into the Maryland SIP, as well as amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.01,
26.11.01.04, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.13.05, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.11, and 26.11.19.12,
which were proposed for approval on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028) in Maryland's ozone SIP, which Maryland submitted
to EPA on April 5, 1991.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

I11This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, pertaining to corrections
to VOC regulations in the Maryland ozone SIP, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate
circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not
affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition
for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not
be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of Michigan for the purpose of establishing new Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules
for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On June 12, 1993 and November 12, 1993 the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted VOC rules to the EPA as proposed revisions to Michigan's ozone SIP. These revisions
address deficiencies listed in letters dated December 11, 1990 and August 23, 1991 to the State of Michigan commenting
on proposed State regulations (addressing the requirement of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (Act) that States
correct deficient VOC RACT rules (``fix-up'' requirement)) and the requirement of the Act that States adopt VOC RACT
rules where not previously required (``catch-up'' requirement). Further, these revisions address deficiencies
in Rules 628 and 629 which were disapproved on December 12, 1993 (58 FR 64678). The rationale for the approval is set
forth in this final rule; additional information is available at the address indicated. Elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

, EPA is proposing approval of, and soliciting public comment on, this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments
are received on this direct final rule, EPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in the final
action on the proposed rule published in the proposed rules section of this 

Federal Register

. Unless this final rule is withdrawn, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested SIP revision. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Under section 107 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), EPA designated certain areas in each State as not
attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. For Michigan, see 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978)
and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978). For these areas, section 172(a) of the 1977 Act, required that the State revise its
SIP to provide for attaining the primary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than December 31, 1982.

1 







Sections 172 (b) and (c) of the 1977 Act require that for stationary sources, an approvable SIP must include legally
enforceable requirements reflecting the application of RACT to sources of VOC emissions. For the purpose of assisting
State and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared three groups of Control Techniques Guideline (CTG)
documents which each establish the presumptive norm for RACT for a specific source category. In cases where the State
adopts rules that are less stringent than in the CTG, the State must justify that those rules are RACT for that source
or source category. In partial response to the requirement for VOC RACT rules, the State of Michigan submitted and
EPA approved controls representing the application of RACT for certain stationary sources of VOCs covered by the
first two groups of CTGs (RACT I_40 CFR 52.1170(c)(16) (45 FR 29790); 40 CFR 52.1170(c)(39) (46 FR 43422); 40 CFR 52.1170(c)(56)
(47 FR 32116) and RACT II_40 CFR 52.1170(c)(56) (47 FR 32116)).

Section 172 of the 1977 Act authorized EPA to grant extensions to those States that could not demonstrate attainment
of the ozone standard by December 31, 1982 if certain conditions were met by the States in revising their air pollution
control program. These areas became known as extension areas. Michigan requested and received an extension to December
31, 1987 for achieving the ozone NAAQS in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties. This extension was granted on June 2,
1980 (45 FR 37196) and obligated the State to develop, for those counties, RACT regulations for sources that are addressed
by the Group III CTGs (RACT III) and RACT regulations for major sources that are not addressed by a CTG (major non-CTG
RACT).

2 







On May 26, 1988 pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the 1977 Act, EPA Region 5 notified Governor James J. Blanchard
that the Michigan SIP was substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies
in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). Among other deficiencies, EPA noted that the State had not yet submitted
the RACT regulations for sources in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties that were covered by the third set of CTGs. 

On November 15, 1990 the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399 (codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). By operation of law, the Detroit area, including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties, retained its nonattainment
designation and was classified as a moderate nonattainment area for ozone. Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires
each State to submit to EPA by May 15, 1991 revisions or additions to its SIP to correct deficiencies in its RACT rules
for ozone. Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act applies to those ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal or above,
and requires States to adopt and correct RACT rules for such areas pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted
in pre-amendment guidance.

3

 Because the Detroit area (including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties) is classified as moderate, the area is subject
to this RACT ``fix-u'' requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 





Other areas within Michigan also retained a designation of nonattainment and were classified by operation of law
upon enactment. These areas are also subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. However, under EPA's pre-amendment
guidance

4

 interpreting the requirements of section 172(b) these areas were not required to adopt RACT rules for sources covered
by the Group III CTGs. Therefore, for purposes of the May 15, 1991 deadline, only three counties were required to have
RACT rules for Group III CTG sources.

Areas that are designated nonattainment, that are classified as moderate or above, and that were not previously required
to adopt RACT rules for sources covered by the Group III CTGs, are required to adopt such rules under section 182(b)(2)
of the amended Act.
 Section 182(b)(2) requires that these areas adopt RACT rules for: (1) Each category of VOC sources in the area covered
by a CTG document issued by the Administrator between the date of enactment of the 1990 Amendments and the date of attainment,
by a date specified by the Administrator; (2) all VOC sources in the area covered by any CTG issued before the date of
enactment; and (3) all other major stationary sources of VOCs that are located in the area, by November 15, 1992. The
requirements of section 182(b)(2) are also referred to as ``catch-up'' requirements. For these areas, RACT rules
for the Group III CTGs are due on November 15, 1992. 





On April 28, 1989 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy outstanding commitments in its 1982 ozone SIP for southeast
Michigan (Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties). The regulations submitted addressed RACT III categories for fugitive
VOC leaks from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) and natural gas plants, Rules 628 and
629, as well as non-CTG categories for paint and resin manufacturing and coating of auto, truck, and business machine
parts. These are rules 630, 631, and 632, respectively. At the time MDNR submitted these rules, EPA only required adoption
of rules for Ract III categories in extension areas. However, MDNR chose to expand the applicability of these rules
to all of the counties listed in EPA's SIP-Call, which include the Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Muskegon areas. This
submittal, therefore, addressed requirements of EPA's SIP-Call, section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act (for Wayne, Oakland,
and Macomb Counties), and section 182(b)(2) of the Act (for Livingston, Monroe, St. Clair, Washtenaw, Kent, Ottawa,
and Muskegon Counties). 

On December 9, 1993 EPA disapproved two of the five RACT III category rules (58 FR 40759). The rules disapproved were
those that covered VOC leaks from synthetic organic chemical and polymer manufacturing plants (Rule 628) and natural
gas processing plants (Rule 629). 

On June 12, 1993 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy the section 182(a)(2)(A) fix-up requirements of the
Act. Included in these regulations were changes meant to address deficiencies listed in EPA's May 26, 1988 SIP call.
Since MDNR chose to expand the coverage of these regulations to all of the 10 ozone nonattainment counties classified
as moderate (Michigan has no ozone nonattainment classifications above moderate), this submittal also addressed
requirements under section 182(b)(2). EPA found this submittal to be complete in a letter dated June 28, 1993 from
Valdas Adamkus, EPA's Region 5 Administrator, to Roland Harmes, Director of MDNR. This letter stopped a sanctions
process which was initiated on October 22, 1991 for failure to submit a SIP revision to fulfill the fix-up requirements.


Under a cover letter dated November 15, 1993 MDNR submitted final regulations to satisfy the remaining deficiencies
not addressed in the June 12, 1993 submittal, to correct deficiencies cited in the December 9, 1993 disapproval of
Rules 628 and 629, and to satisfy the catch-up requirements of section 182(b)(2) of the Act. A letter dated April 18,
1994 from Valdas Adamkus to Roland Harmes found the November 15, 1993 submittal complete for the Detroit_Ann Arbor
area and halted the sanctions process which was started on January 15, 1993 for a failure to submit these regulations.
The clock for the Muskegon and Grand Rapids areas continued to run because of an outstanding item which was not submitted
for the western portion of the State. 

A finding of completeness was made in a July 14, 1994 letter from Valdas Adamkus to Roland Harmes for the Grand Rapids
and Muskegon areas. This finding was in response to the submittal of a non-CTG SIP submittal made for the western portion
of the State and halted the last of the sanction clocks that were started on January 15, 1993 for the State of Michigan.


This document proposes approval of the final regulations submitted by MDNR on June 12, 1993 and November 15, 1993 for
incorporation into Michigan's ozone SIP. 



II. EPA's Evaluation and Proposed Action 



In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the Act and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the Act and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for this action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 3. Among these provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for existing major stationary
sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. 

Under the amended Act, Congress ratified EPA's use of CTG documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring
States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A).

EPA's Analysis of the State's Submittal 



The following is a summary of the major changes to Michigan's VOC regulations contained in the State's submittal.




I. June 1993 Submittal 



On June 12, 1993 MDNR submitted to EPA a SIP revision to address deficiencies in the State's ozone SIP. Listed below
are descriptions of the changes contained in this submittal. 



A. Rules 101, 103, 105, 116, 122 (Definitions A; C; E; P; V) 



Definitions have been added or revised and include the following. These sections have additionally been renumbered
to accommodate those definitions which have been added or deleted. 

(1) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Actual emissions'' to not apply in Parts 6 and 7 of these rules. Parts 6 and 7
regulate the emissions of VOCs. 

(2) MDNR has removed one of the two definitions of ``Air-dried coating'' from the State's rules. Now there is only one
definition which applies to all of the rules. 

(3) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Air quality standard'' to mean the concentration and duration of an air contaminant
specified by the commission or by the national ambient air quality standards as contained in the provisions of 40 CFR
part 50 (1990), whichever is more restrictive, as the maximum acceptable concentration and duration of that contaminant
in the ambient air. 

(4) MDNR has added the definition of ``Calendar day'' which means a 24-hour time period which normally is midnight
to midnight, but which may, upon written notification to the commission, cover a different, consecutive 24-hour
time period for a specific process. 

(5) MDNR has added the definition of ``Coating category'' which means a type of surface coating for which there is a
separate emission limit specified in these rules. 

(6) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating line'' to mean an operation which is a single series in a coating process
and which is comprised of 1 or more coating applicators and any associated flash-off areas, drying areas and ovens
wherein 1 or more surface coatings are applied and subsequently dried or cured. 

(7) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of fabric'' to include the application of coating by saturations
and impregnation. 

(8) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of paper'' to include saturation.

(9) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of vinyl'' to not include the application of plastisols. 

(10) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Completed organic resin'' to include dry organic resin. 

(11) MDNR has revised the definition of ``component'' and lists specific parts which are designated as ``components''
for Rules 336.1622, 336.1628, 336.1629, and specifically excludes a valve that has no external controls, therefore
having no potential to leak VOCs.

<DOCNO> FR940907-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(12) MDNR has added the definition of ``Extreme environmental conditions'' to mean any of the following: (i) Outdoor
weather; (ii) temperatures consistently above 95 degrees celsius (203 degrees fahrenheit); (iii) detergents;
(iv) abrasive and scouring agents; (v) solvents; (vi) corrosive atmospheres; (vii) other similar harsh conditions.

(13) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Extreme performance coating'' to mean a coating which is designed to protect
a coated part from extreme environmental conditions and which is applied to a part that, in its use as a finished product,
is intended to be subjected to extreme environmental conditions. 
(14) MDNR has removed the definition of ``Pneumatic tire manufacturing''. 
(15) MDNR has added the definition of ``Vapor collection system'' which means, as it pertains to the provisions of
R 336.1627, all piping, seals, hoses, connections, pressure-vacuum vents, and any other equipment between and including
the delivery vessel and a stationary vessel, vapor processing unit, or vapor holder. 
(16) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Volatile organic compound'' to mean any compound of carbon or mixture of
compounds of carbon that has a vapor pressure of more than 0.1 millimeter of mercury at standard conditions, excluding
a number of listed compounds. The definition also includes compounds of carbon or mixtures of compounds of carbon
with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 0.1 millimeter of mercury at standard conditions and which participates
in atmospheric photochemical reactions. 
(17) The following definitions have undergone minor word changes (for example, changing the word ``which'' to ``that''):
Allowable emissions, Coating of automobiles and light-duty trucks, Coating of large appliances, Component, Condenser,
Contemporaneous, Creditable, Electrostatic prep coat, Equivalent method, Potential emissions, Potential to
emit, Printed interior panel, Publication rotogravure printing, Pushside, Very large precipitator. 


B. Rule 602 (General Provisions for Existing Sources of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions) 


MDNR has listed items which can deviate from the Part 6 regulations given State approval. However, in addition to needing
State approval for any equivalent emission rate, alternate emission rate, or compliance method, any provision listed
under 602(2) must, generally, be sent to EPA as a SIP revision and will not become federally enforceable until the SIP
revision request is approved by the EPA. 
Two minor exceptions to the above provisions which do not need to be submitted as site-specific SIP revisions but must
still have State approval are discussed in the Technical Support Document.

6 






In this rule the State also clarifies that for rules 336.1610, 336.1621 and 336.1632 the phrase ``minus water'' shall
also include compounds which are used as organic solvents and which are excluded from the definition of volatile organic
compound. In other rules, the limits are based on emission rates, usually in pounds per hour, so the phrase ``minus
water'' is only used in rules 336.1610, 336.1621 and 336.1632 whose applicable limits are based on VOC content. 


C. Rule 610 (Existing Coating Lines; Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Automobile, Light-duty
Truck, and Other Product and Material Coating Lines)


In this rule the State sets forth the limits which shall be applied to the following coating line categories: automobiles
and light-duty trucks, cons, coils, large appliances, metal furniture, magnet wire, and the nonmetallic surfaces
of fabrics, vinyl, or paper. In addition to meeting the applicable emission limits, sources covered by this rule must
also submit a written program to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits. Recordkeeping requirements are
also contained within this rule. Exemptions based on, e.g., emission cutpoints (15 pounds per day), are listed in
this rule. 


D. Rule 611 (Existing Cold Cleaners) 


In this rule MDNR sets forth provisions for operating procedures for cold cleaners. Written procedures for compliance
with these provisions must be developed and posted. Units that were previously exempt under the older version of these
rules will have until 6 months after the date these rules become effective, in the State, to comply. 


E. Rule 619 (Perchloroethylene; Emission From Existing Dry Cleaning Equipment) 


In this rule MDNR sets forth provisions to control the emissions of perchloroethylene from existing dry cleaners.
In all instances, save one, where a comment was made by EPA on this rule, either the State made the change suggested by
EPA or EPA withdrew the comment. Even though one comment has not been addressed, EPA finds this rule approvable. Moreover,
EPA notes that it has issued a maximum available control technology or ``MACT'' rule for this emission source category
with which sources will need to comply. 


F. Rule 620 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Flat Wood Paneling Coating Lines) 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The State sets forth the emission limits which shall apply to sources of VOC used in the coating of flat wood paneling.
The State has replaced methods for determining VOC content in a coating with other recordkeeping and compliance requirements.
The State has removed a provision allowing State discretion on equivalent emission rates and transfer efficiencies.
The State lists exemptions to this rule. The State describes under what circumstances the use of an afterburner, used
to achieve compliance with the emission limits in this rule, may be interrupted outside of the ozone season. 


G. Rule 621 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Metallic Surface Coating Lines) 


The State sets forth the emission limits for existing metallic surface coating lines and the compliance and recordkeeping
requirements needed to demonstrate compliance with these limits. The State establishes an alternate limit for glass
adhesion primer which is used to affix windshields to automobile frames. This alternate limit and its justification
is discussed in this action's technical support document. The State has also replaced language providing State discretion
and pertaining to equivalent emission rates and transfer efficiencies with new more explicit language which, in
addition to being acceptable to the commission, must also receive EPA's approval before being incorporated into
the SIP. The State lists exemptions to the provisions of this rule. In certain instances, the rule for coating of automobile,
truck, and business machine parts (R 336.1632) may apply. When a source is complying with R 336.1632 it will not have
to comply with R 336.1622. 
In addition to these specific exemptions, the State also provides broader based exemptions as well. With the addition
of new exemptions, other existing exemptions were removed from the regulations. Any coating lines that were previously
exempt under the exemptions that have been removed from the rules and are no longer exempt, now have 1 year from the State's
adoption date of these rules to demonstrate compliance. The State has included provisions allowing the discontinuance
of a natural gas-fired afterburner, used to meet the emission limits of this rule, between November 1 and March 31.



H. Rule 622 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Components of Petroleum Refineries; Refinery
Monitoring Program) 


The State has added to the list of components which require annual inspection those components that are ``difficult
to monitor.'' The State has replaced the requirements for all inspections described in EPA 450/2-78-036
with Federal Reference Test Method 21. The State has defined leaking as an instance when a concentration of more than
10,000 ppm, by volume, as methane or hexane, is measured by Method 21. 
The State has added the following provisions:
(i) If for 2 consecutive quarters 2 percent or less of the process valves in a given refinery unit are found to be leaking,
then inspections may be skipped for 1 quarter. If for 5 consecutive quarters 2 percent or less of the process valves
in a given refinery unit are found to be leaking, then inspections of process valves may be done annually. If a subsequent
inspection shows that more than 2 percent of the process valves are leaking, quarterly inspections shall again be
required. 
(ii) To determine the percent of valves leaking on a refinery unit, the total number of valves found to be leaking on
the refinery unit during the specified monitoring period shall be divided by the number of valves required to be monitored.

Under exemptions from the monitoring requirements of this rule, the State has removed an exemption for inaccessible
valves but added an exemption for components that are unsafe to monitor, until monitoring personnel would no longer
be exposed to immediate danger. 
The State has added the requirement that a current, written description detailing routine sampling procedures and
listing the sealing devices involved shall be maintained and, upon request by the commission, shall be submitted
to the commission in an acceptable format. 


I. Rule 623 (Storage of Petroleum Liquids Having a True Vapor Pressure of More Than 1.0 psia, but Less Than 11.0
psia, in Existing External Floating Roof Stationary Vessels of More Than 40,000-gallon Capacity) 


The State has added to its list of exemptions for external floating roof stationary vessels, those vessels that are
used to store jet naphtha (Jet B or JP-4).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The State has added the requirement that any person who is responsible for the operation of a vessel that meets 1 of the
criteria for exemption shall maintain records of the following: 
(i) The capacity of the stationary vessel. 
(ii) The contents of the stationary vessel. 
(iii) The type of the stationary vessel. 



and may also include:
 



(i) The type of primary seal. 
(ii) The true vapor pressure of the petroleum liquid. 


J. Rule 624 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From an Existing Graphic Arts Line) 


The State has rewritten much of the Graphic Arts Rule. The new rule sets forth the emission limits, recordkeeping requirements,
compliance demonstration requirements and exemptions for the affected sources. These rules, for the most part,
are written to have a statewide effect. 


K. Rule 625 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Equipment Utilized in Manufacturing Synthesized
Pharmaceutical Products) 


The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative
control technology to allowable emission levels. The method for determining the actual emission level is found in
R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile
Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA-450/2-78-029.

The State has added language stating that a person shall not be required to reduce the temperature of a gas stream flowing
through a condenser below the freezing point of a condensible component in the gas stream if it can be shown using intrinsic
chemical data that the condenser would be rendered ineffective. 
The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative
control technology to allowable emission levels resulting from the use of a pressure/vacuum conservation vent.
The method for determining the actual emission level is found in R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall
be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture
of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA-450/2-78-029. 
The State has removed the provision requiring interim reduction milestones since the dates of these milestones had
all passed several years before this package was submitted. 
The State has added daily recordkeeping requirements which must be complied with within 3 months of the State's effective
date of this rule. The records required shall include: 
(i) For reactors, distillation operations, crystallizers, centrifuges, and vacuum dryers which are controlled
by a condenser or an alternative control technology: 
(a) A list of all VOCs in the stream. 
(b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC. 
(c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture. 
(d) The gas outlet temperature of each condenser. 
(ii) For operations that are in compliance with the exemption provisions listed in this rule, the amount of material
entering and exiting each reactor, distillation operation, crystallizer, centrifuge, and vacuum dryer. 
(iii) For air dryers, the amount of material entering and exiting each air dryer. 
(iv) A person loading a VOC which has a vapor pressure of more than 210 millimeters of mercury, measured at 20 degrees
Celsius, from a truck or railcar into an existing stationary vessel of more than a 2,000 gallon capacity using a vapor
balance system or alternate control system shall maintain records of the following information: 
(a) The date and time each vessel is loaded. 
(b) The type and vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC loaded into each stationary vessel.

(v) For centrifuges, rotary vacuum filters, or other filters that have an exposed liquid surface, where the liquid
contains a VOC or VOCs and the sum of the partial pressures is 26.2 millimeters of mercury or more, as measured at 20 degrees
Celsius, the following records shall be maintained: 
(a) A list of all VOCs in the liquid. 
(b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC. 
(c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture. 
(vi) For any equipment from which a liquid containing a VOC or VOCs can be observed dripping or running the following
records shall be kept: 
(a) The date and time each leak was detected. 
(b) The date and time each leak was repaired. 


L. Rule 627 (Delivery Vessels; Vapor Collection Systems) 


The State lists the provisions which must be met by all delivery vessels subject to control by a vapor collection system
required by R 336.1606, R 336.1607, R 336.1608, R 336.1609, R 336.1703, R 336.1704,
R 336.1705, or R 336.1706. The modifications made by the State to this rule are: (1) Listing gauge pressures
in inches of water as well as in pounds per square inch, and (2) moving the definition of ``vapor collection system''
from this rule to  R 336.1122 (Definitions; V). 


M. Rule 630 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Paint Manufacturing Processes)

The State lists the 10 moderate ozone nonattainment areas where these regulations shall apply. The State has removed
several of the exemption provisions and is allowing sources which were previously exempt, 1 year from the rules' effective
date (i.e. by April 27, 1994) to achieve compliance with these rules. Examples of these sources would be those that
were not covered by the previous rules because the rules did not apply in that area. April 19, 1990 is the date by which
other sources must achieve compliance. 


N. Rule 631 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Process Equipment Utilized in Manufacture
of Polystyrene or Other Organic Resins) 


The State lists the 10 moderate ozone nonattainment areas that these regulations shall apply in. 
The State requires that a person shall not operate a reactor, thinning tank, or blending tank unless either of the following
provisions is complied with: 
(i) All VOCs emitted from existing reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks shall be vented to control equipment
that is designed and operated to reduce the quantity of VOCs by not less than 95 weight percent. Reflux condensers that
are essential to the operation of the resin reactor are not considered to be control equipment. 
(ii) The total VOCs emitted to the atmosphere from the reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks do not exceed 0.5
pounds per 1,000 pounds of completed organic resin produced. 
Notwithstanding the preceding requirement, the State requires the Monsanto Company of Trenton to comply with either
of the following provisions for its reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks: 
(i) All VOCs emitted from reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks shall be vented to control equipment that is
designed and operated to reduce the quantity of VOCs by not less than 95 weight percent. Reflux condensers that are
essential to the operation of the resin reactor are not considered to be control equipment. 
(ii) The total VOCs emitted to the atmosphere from the reactors, thinning tanks, and blending tanks do not exceed 2.6
pounds per 1,000 pounds of dry organic resin produced. 
The State has altered the recordkeeping requirement to now be mandatory for all sources subject to this rule. The recordkeeping
requirements are effective 3 months after the effective date of this rule. The records which need to be kept will vary
depending upon the fashion in which a source chooses to control the VOC emissions and may include any of the following
information: 



(i) Emissions test data. 
(ii) Material balance calculations. 
(iii) Process production rates. 
(iv) Control equipment specifications and operating parameters. 



The State has revised one of the provisions to read, 



A person may discontinue the operation of a natural gas-fired afterburner, which is used to achieve compliance with
the emission limits in this rule, between November 1 and March 31 unless the afterburner is used to achieve compliance
with, or is required by, any of the following: 



(a) Any other provision of these rules. 
(b) A permit to install. 
(c) A permit to operate. 
(d) A voluntary agreement. 
(e) A performance contract. 
(f) A stipulation. 
(g) An order of the commission.



If the operation of a natural gas-fired afterburner is discontinued between November 1 and March 31 pursuant to the
provisions of the preceding provision, both of the following shall apply during this time period: 
(a) All other provisions of this rule, except the emission limits, shall remain in effect. 
(b) All other measures that are used to comply with the emission limits in this rule between April 1 and October 31 shall
continue to be used.

A RACT analysis has been performed for the limit of 2.6 lb VOC emissions/1,000 pounds of dry organic resin produced
set for Monsanto and has been found to be comparable to a RACT limit set for a similar Monsanto facility in Massachusetts
and is therefore approvable. 

Rule 631(6) seems ambiguous as to what information is necessary to determine compliance because of the presence of
the wording ``information may include.'' The State has provided EPA with all of the compliance orders for all of the
facilities affected by this rule and they have been reviewed to determine if sufficient information is included to
determine compliance with this rule. EPA has found all of the compliance orders to contain sufficient information
to determine compliance. All facilities are required to keep sufficient records for determination of compliance
with this rule. Rule 702(d), described later in this package, requires new sources which could fall under this category
to meet the same emission limits as existing sources in this category. The State has also written a letter, dated July
13, 1994, that clarifies the intent of this rule is to require new sources to meet not only the same emission limits as
existing sources but also to meet the same recordkeeping and reporting requirements as existing sources as well.




O. Rule 632 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Automobile, Truck, and Business Machine
Plastic Part Coating Lines) 



The State has expanded the geographic limits of these rules to cover all of the moderate nonattainment counties in
the State. The cross-line averaging provisions of this rule have been removed. Recordkeeping requirements have
been changed to be more stringent than previously required. 



P. Rule 702 (General Provisions for new Sources of Volatile Organic Compound Missions) 



The State has added a provision stating that new sources of VOCs shall be limited to the lowest emission rate listed
in the following: (1) The maximum allowable emission rate listed by a commission on its own initiative or based upon
the application of the best available control technology; (2) the maximum allowable emission rate specified by a
new source performance standard promulgated by the EPA; (3) the maximum allowable emission rate specified as a condition
of a permit to install or a permit to operate; or (4) the limit for this source category as is listed in the rules for existing
sources. 



Q. R 336.2004 Appendix A; Reference Test Methods; Adoption of Federal Reference Test Methods 



In this appendix, the State has added the following Federal Reference Test Methods to the list of those already adopted
by reference: 

(1) Method 1A_Sample and velocity traverses for stationary sources with small stacks or ducts. 

(2) Method 2A_Direct measurement of gas volume through pipes and small ducts. 

(3) Method 2C_Determination of stack gas velocity and volumetric flow rate in small stacks and ducts (standard pitot
tube). 

(4) Method 2D_Measurement of gas volumetric flow rates in small pipes and ducts. 

(5) Method 10B_Determination of carbon monoxide from stationary sources. 



R. R 336.2006 Reference Test Method Serving as Alternate Version of Federal Reference Test Method 25 by Incorporating
Byron Analysis 



The State sets forth provisions by which Federal Test Method 25 may be conducted by incorporating the Byron analysis.




S. R 336.2007 Alternate Version of Procedure L, Referenced in R 336.2040(10) 



The State sets forth provisions by which an alternate version of the Federal Procedure L may be used. 



T. R 336.2040 Method for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Coating Lines and Graphic
Arts Lines 



The State sets forth provisions describing methods for determining compliance for coating lines in this rule. Appropriate
methods are described for the various coating lines whose emission limits may be expressed differently from one another
depending on the method of compliance being used. 

The State requires that for sources subject to emission limits expressed as pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, minus
water, as applied, the phrase ``minus water'' shall also include compounds which are used as organic solvents and
which are excluded from the definition of volatile organic compound. 

For calculations required by this rule, the State requires the following: 

(1) Not less than 5 significant digits shall be carried in intermediate calculations. Rounding shall occur after
final calculations and emission numbers will be rounded to not less than 2 but not more than 3 significant figures.


(2) The calculations for a coating line shall include all of the coatings which are in the same coating category and
which are used during the averaging period as specified in the applicable limit. 

(3) In most cases, the calculations for a graphic arts line shall include all of the inks and coatings that are used during
the averaging period as specified in the applicable emission limit. 

The State describes the methods by which the VOC content of inks and coatings, and the weight of VOCs used during an averaging
period shall be determined. 



U. R 336.2041 Recordkeeping Requirements for Coating Lines and Graphic Arts Lines 



The State sets forth the recordkeeping requirements which shall apply to coating lines and graphic arts lines. These
provisions require that records for the various types of coating and graphic arts lines be kept.

<PARENT> FR940907-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The types of records that must be kept are specific to the coating or graphic arts line and the method by which it is meeting
the appropriate emission limit. 

All of the rules submitted for approval in the June 12, 1993 submittal have been reviewed and found to be approvable
for incorporation into the Michigan ozone SIP. 



II. November 1993 Submittal 



On November 15, 1993 MDNR submitted to EPA a SIP revision to address the remaining deficiencies in the State's VOC RACT
regulations which were not corrected by the June 12, 1993 submittal. Listed below are descriptions of the changes
this SIP submittal proposed. 



A. Rule 601 (Definitions) 



A revised definition for the term ``person responsible'' as used in Part 6 rules has been added. 



B. Rule 602 (General Provisions for Existing Sources of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions) 



Provisions allowing for alternative compliance methods in Rules 628 and 629 require site-specific SIP revisions
when implemented. 



C. Rule 624 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From an Existing Graphic Arts Line) 



An unacceptable prorating method for recordkeeping has been removed. 



D. Rule 628 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Components of Existing Process Equipment Used in
Manufacturing Synthetic Organic Chemicals and Polymers; Monitoring Program) and Rule 629 (Emission of Volatile
Organic Compounds From Components of Existing Process Equipment Used in Processing Natural Gas; Monitoring Program)




Test methods have been added which define how the percent VOC in a piece of equipment is to be determined. Provisions
allowing reduced frequency of monitoring for low-leaking equipment have been changed to comply with EPA requirements.
Wording was added requiring that all equivalent control methods must be submitted to EPA as site-specific SIP revisions
as specified in Rule 602. The counties affected by these rules have been listed in the same format as other similar rules,
for the purpose of uniformity. 



E. Non-CTG RACT Rules 



There are 3 non-CTG major sources of VOCs located in Michigan's Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area. These
sources are: VCF Films, Inc.; Ford Motor Company's Utica Trim Plant; and the Woodbridge Corporations Whitmore Lake
Plant (formerly Johnson Controls, Inc.). The course of action Michigan pursued for these companies was the development
of administrative consent orders requiring implementation of RACT-level controls. 

VCF Films, Inc. has entered into an administrative consent order requiring RACT-level controls for VOC emissions
for its film casting processes. This order has been submitted as a SIP revision.

<DOCNO> FR940907-0-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Ford Motor Company's Utica Trim Plant has entered into an administrative consent order requiring RACT-level controls
for its polyurethane foam manufacturing processes, reaction injection molding processes, and various adhesive
operations at this facility. This order has been submitted as a SIP revision. 

The Woodbridge Corporation, Whitmore Lake Plant (formerly Johnson Controls, Inc.) has entered into an administrative
consent order requiring RACT-level controls for VOC emissions for its polyurethane foam automotive seat cushion
manufacturing operation, and elimination of all methylene chloride emissions from the facility. This order has
been submitted as a SIP revision. 

These 3 site-specific, non-CTG regulations have been reviewed by US EPA and are being approved for inclusion into
Michigan's SIP. 



F. Stage I Vapor Recovery 



Michigan has controlled VOC emissions from underground tank loading at service stations, called Stage I controls,
since the early 1980s. Rule 606, the Stage I rule, currently requires services stations in the Detroit, Flint, Grand
Rapids, and Lansing urban areas to have their underground gasoline storage tanks equipped with vapor balance equipment
when unloading gasoline at the service stations. 

New Stage I legislation has recently been enacted and submitted as part of the November 12, 1993 submittal which expands
the geographic coverage of the current program and lowers the exemption level. Service stations with greater than
10,000 gallons per month of gasoline sales and located in the 10 county moderate nonattainment areas will now be required
to implement the Rule 606 Stage I controls and meet the equipment specifications as specified by the California Air
Resources Board. In addition, pressure/vacuum valves on the underground storage tank vents will now be mandatory,
as required in the equipment specifications. 

All of the rules submitted on November 12, 1993 have been reviewed and been found to be approvable by the EPA for incorporation
into the Michigan ozone SIP. 



G. Negative Declarations 



In a letter dated March 30, 1994, meant to supplement the November 12, 1993 submittal, Michigan included current negative
declarations for the following CTG categories: (1) Large petroleum dry cleaners; (2) SOCMI air oxidation processes;
(3) High-density polyethylene and polypropylene resin manufacturing; and (4) Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing.
These current negative declarations obviate the need for Michigan to develop regulations for these source categories
because none of these types of sources exist in the State. 



Federal Action 



The EPA approves the VOC RACT rules submitted as a SIP revision for the State of Michigan to the EPA on June 12, 1993 and
November 12, 1993. The EPA has evaluated all of Michigan's rules, as submitted on June 12, 1993 and November 12, 1993
for consistency with the requirements of the Act, EPA regulations and the EPA's interpretation of these requirements
as expressed in EPA policy documents. The EPA has found that the rules meet the requirements applicable to ozone and
are, therefore, approvable for incorporation into the State's ozone SIP. A more complete discussion of the EPA's
review of the State's regulations is contained in technical support documents dated December 11 1990, August 23,
1991, and May 5, 1994. The EPA is proposing to approve this revision as fully meeting the RACT fix-up requirements of
section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act and the RACT catch-up requirements of section 182(b)(2) of the Act. 

Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This
action will become effective on November 7, 1994. However, if we receive adverse comments by October 7, 1994, EPA will
publish: (1) a document that withdraws this action; and (2) address the comments received in the final rule on the requested
SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this 

Federal Register

. 



Miscellaneous 



A. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions 



Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The EPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.




C. Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

D. Petitions for Judicial Review 



Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Bifenthrin; Pesticide Tolerances and Extension of Tolerances




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of November 15, 1997) for residues of the
snythetic pyrethroid bifenthrin in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) corn (field, seed, and pop) grain,
silage (forage), stover (fodder); milk, milk fat; meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses,
sheep, and poultry; and eggs. FMC Corp. petitioned EPA to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the
pesticide in or on the commodities. EPA also is establishing time-limited tolerances for residues of bifenthrin
in or on cottonseed and dried hops. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32167), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that pursuant to pesticide petition 7F3546
and subsequent amendments to it, the FMC Corp., 1735 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had requested that pursuant
to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, EPA amend 40 CFR part 180 to establish
tolerances for residues of the pesticide bifenthrin, (2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate,
and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite in or on the commodities corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm),
forage at 2.0 ppm, fodder at 5.0 ppm; milk, fat (reflecting 0.1 ppm in whole milk) at 1.0 ppm; meat of cattle, goats, hogs,
horses, poultry, and sheep at 0.05 ppm; meat byproducts (mbyp) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm;
poultry mbyp at 0.05 ppm; fat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 1.0 ppm; poultry fat at 0.05 ppm; cottonseed
at 0.5 ppm; hops, dried at 10.0 ppm; and eggs at 0.05 ppm. EPA proposed to establish time-limited tolerances, with an
expiration date of November 15, 1997. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerances will protect
the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Federal Travel Regulation; Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act Requirements



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Supply Service, GSA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to incorporate standards for Federal agency compliance
with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391, Sept. 25, 1990). These provisions are intended
to enhance the safety of Federal employees traveling on official business.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391, Sept. 25, 1990), hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act'', among other things, amended title 5, United States Code, by adding new    5707(d) and 5707a to save
lives and protect property by promoting fire and life safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation
affecting commerce.




Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Guidelines 



The Act sets standards for fire prevention and control in places of public accommodation affecting commerce. These
requirements include installation of hard-wired, single station smoke detectors in each guest room of each place
of public accommodation, and an automatic sprinkler system in each place of public accommodation that is more than
three stories. The Act further requires each State to submit to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) a list of places of public accommodation in the State that comply with the Act's fire safety standards. From
the State lists, FEMA must compile and publish in the 

Federal Register 

a national master list and distribute it to each Federal agency. The Act requires FEMA to periodically update the master
list based on information provided by the States, and to distribute the updated list to each agency.



Federal Travel Program Compliance 



The Act requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to modify certain of its travel programs to adhere to established
fire safety guidelines. This includes listing in the Federal Travel Directory only those lodging establishments
that comply with the Act's fire safety standards, specifying which access and safety devices each establishment
provides for the hearing impaired or visually or physically handicapped, and surveying only accommodations that
meet the Act's fire safety standards when conducting surveys of lodging costs for the purpose of establishing locality
per diem rates.



Agency Compliance 



The Act also requires each agency to ensure that it achieves an adequate ``approved accommodations percentage'',
as specified in the Act and reflected in the regulation, for Fiscal Year 1995 and each fiscal year thereafter (an approved
accommodation is a hotel, motel, or other place of public accommodation affecting commerce that meets the Act's fire
safety standards). The actual approved accommodations percentage is computed by dividing the number of nights spent
throughout the United States, including its territories and possessions, in approved accommodations by the total
number of nights spent throughout the United States, including its territories and possessions, in all places of
public accommodation affecting commerce.

GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866
of 
Sept. 30, 1993. This final rule is not required to be published in the 

Federal Register 

for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.



List of Subjects in 41 CFR Parts 301-1, 301-7, 301-8, 301-11, 301-16, and 301-17



Government employees, Travel, Travel allowances, Travel and transportation expenses




For the reasons set out in the preamble, 41 CFR parts 301-1, 301-7, 301-8, 301-11, and 301-16
are amended and 41 CFR part 301-17 is added as follows:





PART 301-1_APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL RULES



1. The authority citation for part 301-1 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 5701-5709; 31 U.S.C. 1353; 40 U.S.C. 486(c); E.O. 11609, 36 FR 13747, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p.
586.



Subpart A_Authority, Applicability, and General Rules



2. Section 301-1.3 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) to read as follows:




 301-1.3 

General rules.



(a) 

Employee's obligation

_(1) 

Prudent person rule. 

An employee traveling on official business is expected to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent
person would exercise if traveling on personal business. Excess costs, circuitous routes, delays, or luxury accommodations
and services unnecessary or unjustified in the performance of official business are not acceptable under this standard.
Employees will be responsible for excess costs and any additional expenses incurred for personal preference or convenience.

(2) 

Approved (firesafe) accommodation. 

It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391,
Sept. 25, 1990), referred to as ``the Act'' in this paragraph, to save lives and protect property by promoting fire
safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's
goals, employees are strongly encouraged to stay in an approved accommodation when commercial lodging is required.
Such action will serve to benefit all travelers by influencing the management of places of public accommodation affecting
commerce to comply with the Act's fire safety requirements and maintain approved accommodation status. An approved
accommodation provides certain fire detection and safety devices that reduce the likelihood of injury to, and protect
the lives of, travelers.



* * * * *



(c) 

Definitions

_(1) 

Agency. 

Except as otherwise provided in  301-17.2(a) of this chapter, ``agency'' for purposes of this chapter
means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105; a military department; an office, agency, or other establishment
in the legislative branch; and the government of the District of Columbia; but does not include a Government-controlled
corporation, a Member of Congress, or an office or committee of either House of Congress or of the two Houses.



* * * * *



Subpart B_Official Government Business Travel



3. Section 301-1.101 is amended by adding paragraph (b)(4) to read as follows:




 301-1.101 

Authorization of travel.



* * * * *



(b) * * *

(4) It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391,
Sept. 25, 1990), to save lives and protect property by promoting fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public
accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of these goals, each agency, as defined in  301-17.2(a)
of this chapter, when authorizing travel shall take appropriate measures to influence employees who will procure
commercial lodging when performing official travel to stay at a firesafe approved accommodation as defined in  301-17.2(c)
of this chapter. Further, each agency shall establish procedures to ensure that its approved accommodations percentage
is in compliance with the provisions of part 301-17 of this chapter. Additionally, each agency shall be prepared,
as required in  301-17.4(b) of this chapter, to furnish the General Accounting Office with information
necessary for the conduct of an audit of agency compliance with the approved accommodations percentage requirement.



* * * * *



Subpart C_Pre-employment Interview Travel



4. Section 301-1.202 is amended by revising the section heading and by adding paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(6) to
read as follows:




 301-1.202 

Responsibilities for pre-employment interview travel.



(a) * * *

(5) 

Fire safety responsibilities. 

Agencies should encourage an interviewee for his/her safety to stay in an approved accommodation while performing
interview travel, and shall provide the interviewee with a list of approved accommodations in the interview area.
Section 5707(d) of title 5, United States Code requires that the approved accommodations percentage, as defined
in  301-17.2(d) of this chapter, be computed based solely on official travel by employees. An agency,
therefore, shall not collect approved accommodations data from an interviewee. 

(b) * * *

(6) 

Fire safety responsibilities. 

It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391,
Sept. 25, 1990), referred to as ``the Act'' in this paragraph, to save lives and protect property by promoting fire
safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's
goals, an interviewee traveling to a pre-employment interview is strongly encouraged to stay at an approved accommodation
as defined in  301-17.2(c) of this chapter when commercial lodging is required. An approved accommodation
provides certain fire detection and safety devices that reduce the likelihood of injury to, and protect the lives
of, travelers. Section 5707(d) of title 5, United States Code, requires that the approved accommodations percentage,
as defined in  301-17.2(d) of this chapter, be computed based solely on official travel by employees.
An interviewee, therefore, is exempt from the requirement in   301-7.2(a)(4) and 301-8.5(a)(4)
of this chapter to account for approved accommodations data.




5. Section 301-1.205 is amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows:

(e) 

Approved accommodations data. 

Section 5707(d) of title 5, United States Code, requires that the approved accommodations percentage, as defined
in  301-17.2(d) of this chapter, be computed based solely on official travel by employees. An interviewee,
therefore, is exempt from the requirement in  301-11.2(b) of this chapter to account for approved accommodations
data.

allowances that are justified by the circumstances affecting the travel and are allowable under the specific rules
in this part. However, the per diem rates provided for under these rules represent the maximum allowable. To prevent
authorization or approval of per diem allowances in excess of amounts required to meet the necessary per diem expenses
of official travel, consideration shall be given to factors such as those listed in this paragraph that reduce the
necessary expenses of employees (see specific guidelines in  301-7.12 of this part for reducing rates):




(i) Known arrangements or established cost experience at temporary duty locations showing that lodging and/or meals
can be obtained without cost or at reduced cost to the employee;

(ii) Situations in which special rates for accommodations have been made available for a particular meeting, conference,
training or other temporary duty assignments;

(iii) Traveler's familiarity with establishments providing lodging and meals at a lower cost in certain localities,
particularly where repetitive travel or extended stays are involved;

(iv) Modes of transportation where accommodations are provided as part of the transportation cost; and

for the employee by means of an agency purchase order (see  301-7.12(a) of this part).

(2) 

Fire safety responsibilities.

with the fire safety guidelines established in the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-391, Sept.
25, 1990) (see part 301-17 of this chapter). Each agency shall establish accounting procedures to collect from
each employee traveling on official business data regarding the number of nights spent in approved accommodations

accommodation affecting commerce within any State;

(3) Divide the number determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the number determined in paragraph (b)(2)

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This 

Second Memorandum Opinion and Order

 

(2nd MO&O)

 finalizes the service rules for the narrowband personal communications service (PCS). This action is taken in part
on the Commission's own motion and in part in response to a petition for reconsideration of the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order.

 The changes adopted herein are intended to improve the fairness of the licensing process for narrowband PCS and provide
for more effective use of the narrowband PCS spectrum.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's 

2nd MO&O

 in GEN Docket No. 90-314 and ET Docket No. 92-100, adopted August 16, 1994, and released August 25, 1994.
The complete 

2nd MO&O

 is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919
M Street, NW., Washington, D.C., and also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International
Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, D.C. 20037.



Summary of 2nd MO&O



Introduction



1. By this action, we are amending the rules concerning the licensing of ``response channels'' in the narrowband personal
communications services (PCS). Response channels are channels that are set aside to provide existing paging systems
with two-way capability, including acknowledgement of a page or advanced messaging capability. Specifically,
we are modifying the definition of an existing paging licensee, the requirement that an existing paging licensee
operate a base station in the area for which it is applying for a response channel and the rule limiting existing paging
licensees to two response channels in any given geographic area. These changes are in response to a Petition for Reconsideration
of the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in this matter that was filed by the National Association of Business and Educational Radio, Inc. (NABER).
 We are also modifying the attribution standards with regard to narrowband PCS channels and revising the Basic Trading
Area (BTA) service area definition to provide two local service areas in Puerto Rico. We believe these changes will
improve the fairness of the licensing process for narrowband PCS and provide for more effective use of the narrowband
PCS spectrum.

First Report and Order,

 we allocated three megahertz of spectrum at 900 MHz for the narrowband PCS service and adopted rules to govern narrowband
PCS operation. As part of this action, we allotted eight 12.5 kHz wide response channels exclusively for use by existing
common carrier and private paging licensees. In the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order,

 we designated four of the eight response channels for licensing at the Major Trading Area (MTA) level and four for licensing
at the BTA level.
 We also defined an existing paging licensee as a paging licensee authorized under Part 22 or Part 90, as of June 24, 1993,
the adoption date of the 

First Report and Order.

 Additionally, we stated that to be eligible for a response channel license, an existing paging licensee must operate
at least one base station in the MTA or BTA for which it requests a license. Finally, we limited each licensee to two paging
response channels per geographic area.




3. On April 25, 1994, NABER submitted a Petition for Reconsideration of the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 requesting reconsideration and clarification of certain aspects of the eligibility and multiple ownership rules
that apply to the response channels. Comments were filed by Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet);
 no reply comments were filed.




Discussion


Eligibility for Response Channel Licenses


4. As indicated above, we limited eligibility for acquiring narrowband PCS response channels to existing paging
licensees and defined an existing paging licensee to be a paging licensee authorized under Part 22 or Part 90 of our
rules as of June 24, 1993. We also required that the existing paging licensee operate at least one base station in any
MTA or BTA for which it requests a response channel.
5. In its petition, NABER requests that the eligibility requirement to operate a base station in the service or trading
area for which a response channel is sought be changed to a requirement that the applicant merely provide coverage
within the trading area. NABER argues that basing eligibility on the location of a transmitter instead of coverage
area could prevent operators from obtaining response channels. It states that the coverage provided by a single base
station may include more than one BTA and that thus, under the adopted rules, the operator would not be eligible for
response channels in all of the BTAs in which it provides conventional one-way paging services. NABER recommends
that we allow paging licensees to apply for response channels in trading areas that are within 25 miles of the geographic
coordinates of any base station licensed as of May 10, 1994, the release date of the 

Third Report and Order

 in PP Docket No. 93-253 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994.





6. NABER also requests that we clarify whether the June 24, 1993, date for determining whether an entity is an existing
paging licensee is applicable in determining the area of operation for license eligibility purposes. It notes that
an existing carrier, initially licensed as of June 24, 1993, may have expanded or constructed its system into adjacent
areas after June 24, 1993. NABER contends that such a carrier should be able to include its current coverage area for
purposes of obtaining response channels so as to make its entire system compatible and competitive even though parts
of it were constructed or put into operation after June 24, 1993.
7. PageNet, in its comments, generally supports the rule modifications suggested by NABER. In addition, PageNet
requests that the rule limiting applicants to only Part 22 and Part 90 licensees as of June 24, 1993, be eliminated or
modified. It argues that this restriction is not needed to prevent speculative or frivolous applications under an
auction regime and that the ability to improve service should not be arbitrarily restricted to those that were licensees
on a certain date. PageNet requests that the rules be modified to permit applications for response channels by any
licensee operating a system serving at least some portion of the market on the date the application is filed.
8. Our decision to license the response channels on an MTA and BTA basis and to require operation of a base station transmitter
in the service area was intended to facilitate our licensing process and provide a simple method for determining mutually
exclusive applications. Existing paging stations are currently licensed on a mileage separation basis rather than
an MTA and BTA basis. We concur with the parties that there are advantages to basing eligibility on the coverage area
of existing base stations. As noted by NABER, a single base station may often cover more than one BTA. We therefore find
that a coverage area standard for response channel eligibility would better conform with the service needs of existing
paging operations. Accordingly, we are amending our rules to permit licensees to obtain response channels sufficient
to upgrade existing paging systems over their entire coverage area.

9. We also believe that a simple ``brightline'' test is needed for determining the coverage area of existing paging
systems in order to facilitate the licensing of response channels. In considering this issue, we note that while existing
paging operations include several classes of operations with varying service radii, a 20-mile (32.2 kilometer)
radius of reliable service is typical of paging operations. We therefore believe that a 20-mile service radius would
better reflect the service areas of most existing paging operations than the 25-mile standard suggested by NABER.
At the same time, we recognize that, as specified in our rules, some paging operations have service areas larger than
20 or 25 miles. Accordingly, we will consider the service radius of a paging transmitter to be 20 miles for purposes
of determining eligibility for response channel licenses, except that for certain classes of high-powered paging
stations we will use a graduated series of wider service radii specified in our paging rules.
 This standard will establish a clear and concise test for all applicants and minimize the administrative burden on
our resources. Existing paging licensees will be eligible for response channels in any BTA or MTA that encompasses
an authorized base station or which is partly or wholly overlapped by the paging system's service area as defined above.








10. We also find merit in NABER's request to allow existing licensees that expand their service areas after June 24,
1993, to be eligible for response channels in the expanded service areas. This request is consistent with our decision
to provide opportunities for upgrading existing paging operations. We further agree with PageNet that any licensee
operating a system that serves some portion of a market should be eligible to apply for response channels in that market,
regardless of whether the licensee was operating before June 24, 1993. In this regard, we see no reason why operators
of existing systems that have been expanded into adjacent trading areas after June 24, 1993, should be entitled to
bid for response channels in newly served areas while operators of new systems authorized after that date should be
barred from bidding for those channels. We therefore conclude that, as a matter of equity, the eligibility criterion
should be modified to permit any paging licensee to apply for the response channels in a market, so long as the licensee's
system serves some portion of that market on the date the application is filed. In particular, we note that on October
21, 1993, we adopted amendments to our private paging rules that resulted in the issuance of substantial numbers of
new licensees for conventional paging. We find that licensees of both expanded systems and new systems authorized
after June 24, 1993, should have an opportunity to purchase the response channels. Accordingly, we are amending the
eligibility requirements for holding narrowband PCS response channels as follows. Existing paging licensees will
be defined as paging licensees authorized under Part 22 or Part 90 of our Rules as of the deadline for filing applications
to participate in the competitive bidding for the paging response channels.
 This application filing deadline will be established in a public notice.
