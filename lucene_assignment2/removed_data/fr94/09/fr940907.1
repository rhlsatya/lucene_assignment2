Prevailing Rate Systems; Special Wage Schedules for Supervisors of Negotiated Rate Bureau of Reclamation Employees

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule to establish special wage schedules for the supervisors
of certain Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior, employees who negotiate their wage rates.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Bureau of Reclamation electrical power employees in mixed bargaining units (including both workers and supervisors)
were historically paid negotiated rates under the authority of section 9(b) of Pub. L 92-392 and section 704
of Pub. L. 95-454. The historical practice was to pay supervisors a negotiated percentage differential above
the rates of the workers supervised.



In 1989, the Department of the Interior began pulling supervisors out of these mixed bargaining units as contracts
expired, and a new method of paying the supervisors was needed. In 1990, OPM approved a temporary set-aside practice
under former Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 532-1, Appendix V, Listing of Agency Special Wage Schedules
and Rates Documented Under the Federal Wage System (FWS), to continue paying existing negotiated supervisory differentials
for the supervisors removed from the bargaining units. This was based on expected serious, pay-based recruitment
and retention problems if supervisors were placed on regular FWS schedules.
The Department of the Interior has now requested the authority to establish FWS special wage schedules for the supervisors
that use a special job evaluation system and pay rates based on wage surveys of private sector supervisory jobs. The
special wage schedules would cover approximately 109 supervisors in 13 special wage areas (Great Plains Region,
Mid-Pacific Region, Green Springs Power Field Station, Pacific Northwest Region Drill Crew, Snake River Area Office,
Hungry Horse Project Office, Grand Coulee Power Office, Upper Columbia Area Office (Yakima), Colorado River Storage
Project Area, Elephant Butte Area, Lower Colorado Dams Area, Yuma Projects Area, and Bureau of Reclamation, Denver).
Positions formerly evaluated as Foremen II, III, and IV under the Department of the Interior Evaluation Plan for Supervisory
and Leader Positions are covered.
No current employee will have his or her pay rate reduced as a result of these new special schedules. During implementation
of the new special schedules, the initial special wage schedules will not be subject to statutory pay increase limitations.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they would affect only Federal agencies and employees.

 532.285

Special wage schedules for supervisors of negotiated rate Bureau of Reclamation employees.


(a) The Department of the Interior shall establish and issue special wage schedules for wage supervisors of negotiated
rate wage employees in the Bureau of Reclamation. These schedules shall be based on annual special wage surveys conducted
by the Bureau of Reclamation in each special wage area. Survey jobs representing Bureau of Reclamation positions
at up to four levels will be matched to private industry jobs in each special wage area. Special schedule rates for each
position will be based on prevailing rates for that particular job in private industry.
(b) Each supervisory job shall be described at one of four levels corresponding to the four supervisory situations
described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. They shall
be titled in accordance with regular FWS practices with the added designation of level I, II, III, or IV. The special
survey and wage schedule for a given special wage area includes only those occupations and levels having employees
in that area. For each position on the special schedule, there shall be three step rates. Step 2 is the prevailing rate
as determined by the survey, step 1 is 96 percent of the prevailing rate, and step 3 is 104 percent of the prevailing rate.
(c) For each special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation shall designate and appoint a special wage survey committee,
including a chairperson and two other members (at least one of whom shall be a supervisor paid from the special wage
schedule), and one or more two-person data collection teams (each of which shall include at least one supervisor paid
from the special wage schedule). Full-scale surveys shall be planned and conducted in each area at least every 3 years,
with wage change surveys in each intervening year. More frequent full-scale surveys may be scheduled to balance the
agency survey workload. The local wage survey committee shall determine the prevailing rate for each survey job as
a weighted average. Survey specifications are as follows for all surveys:
(1) Tailored to the Bureau of Reclamation activities and types of supervisory positions in the special wage area,
private industry companies to be surveyed shall be selected from among the following Standard Industrial Classification
Major Groups: 12 coal mining; 13 oil and gas extraction; 14 mining and quarrying of nonmetallic minerals, except fuels;
35 manufacturing industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment; 36 manufacturing electronic and
other electrical equipment and components, except computer equipment; 42 motor freight transportation and warehousing;
48 communications; 49 electric, gas, and sanitary services; and 76 miscellaneous repair services. No minimum employment
size is required for surveyed establishments.
(2) Each local wage survey committee shall compile lists of all companies in the survey area known to have potential
job matches. For the first survey, all companies on the list will be surveyed. Subsequently, companies shall be removed
from the survey list if they prove not to have job matches, and new companies will be added if they are expected to have
job matches. Survey data will be shared with other local wage survey committees when the data from any one company is
applicable to more than one special wage area.
(3) For each area, survey job descriptions shall be tailored to correspond to the position of each covered supervisor
in that area. They will be described at one of four levels (I, II, III, or IV) corresponding to the definitions of the
four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard
for Supervisors. A description of the craft, trade, or labor work supervised will be included in each supervisory
survey job description.
(d) Special wage area boundaries shall be identical to the survey areas covered by the special wage surveys. The areas
of application in which the special schedules will be paid are smaller than the survey areas, reflecting actual Bureau
of Reclamation worksites and the often scattered location of surveyable private sector jobs. Special wage schedules
shall be established in the following areas:

Almonds Grown in California; Proposed Salable, Reserve, and Export Percentages for the 1994-95 Crop Year 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule with request for comments.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule invites comments on the establishment of salable, reserve, and export percentages for California
almonds received by handlers during the 
1994-95 almond crop year, which commenced on July 1, 1994. Based on the recommendation of the Almond Board of
California (Board), the agency which locally administers the almond marketing order, and other available information,
it is proposed to establish salable, reserve, and export percentages of 90 percent, 10 percent, and 0 percent, respectively.
This proposed rule is authorized under the marketing order for almonds grown in California and is intended to promote
orderly marketing conditions and avoid unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 [7 CFR Part 981], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of almonds grown in California. The order is effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as
the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposal is not intended
to have retroactive effect. The proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on
the petition. After a hearing the Secretary will rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has
jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later
than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds who are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California
almonds may be classified as small entities.

The National Agricultural Statistics Service estimates 1994 California almond production at 640 million kernelweight
pounds, 31 percent larger than last year. If realized, this could be one of the largest crops on record. 
In order to lessen the impact of this projected large almond supply facing the industry, the Board, at its July 7, 1994,
meeting in Modesto, California, recommended establishing salable, reserve, and export percentages for the 1994-95
crop year by a vote of seven to three. This proposal would require handlers of California almonds to withhold, as a reserve,
from normal domestic and export markets, 10 percent of the merchantable almonds they receive from growers during
the 1994-95 crop year. The remaining 90 percent (the salable percentage) of the crop could be sold by handlers
in any market at any time. The last year salable and reserve percentages were established was the 
1991-92 crop year. 
Almond production, like that of many agricultural commodities, can vary significantly from season-to-season due
to a variety of factors. This in turn can cause wide fluctuations in prices. For example, the Board has estimated grower
prices increased from $1.26 per pound for 1992 crop almonds to nearly $2.00 per pound for 1993 crop almonds, when the
corresponding estimated shipments for those crop years were 535.9 million pounds and 497.7 million pounds, respectively.
The large 1994 California almond crop estimate has caused early speculation of grower prices in the $1.15 per pound
range. Such swings in supplies and price levels can result in market instability and uncertainty for growers, handlers,
buyers, and consumers.
The long term goal of the almond industry is to increase almond consumption and demand, and the Board believes this
can be best achieved in the presence of stable and orderly market conditions. The Board believes that the use of the
reserve provisions of the marketing order as a supply management tool, in conjunction with other marketing tools
available in the order, can assist in accomplishing the industry's goals. 
While this rule could restrict the amount of almonds which handlers could sell in normal domestic and export markets
in the short term, the proposed salable and reserve percentages are intended to promote orderly marketing conditions
by avoiding unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices and improving grower returns. Further, this proposed
rule could help provide market stability during the 1995-96 crop year by reserving almonds for shipment during
that season in the event 1995 production is below trade demand needs. 
Authority to establish salable and reserve percentages is provided in  981.47 of the order. Section 981.66
authorizes disposition of reserve almonds to certain outlets, including export. Pursuant to   981.47
and 981.49 of the order, the Board based its recommendation for salable, reserve, and export percentages of 90 percent,
10 percent, and 0 percent, respectively, on estimates of marketable supply and combined domestic and export trade
demand for the 1994-95 crop year. The Board's 1994 marketable production estimate of 620.8 million kernelweight
pounds is based on a 1994 crop estimate issued by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of 640 million kernelweight
pounds, minus an estimated loss of 19.2 million kernelweight pounds resulting from the removal of inedible kernels
by handlers and losses during manufacturing. 
Trade demand is estimated at 556.4 million kernelweight pounds_175 million pounds for domestic needs and 381.4 million
pounds for export needs. An inventory adjustment is made to account for supplies of salable almonds carried in from
the 1993-94 crop year and for supplies of salable almonds deemed desirable to be carried out on June 30, 1995,
for early season shipment during the 1995-96 crop year. After adjusting for inventory, the trade demand is calculated
at 556.8 million kernelweight pounds. This is the quantity of almonds from the estimated 1994 marketable production
deemed necessary to meet trade demand needs. The proposed salable percentage of 90 percent would meet those needs.

The remaining 10 percent (64 million kernelweight pounds) of the 1994 crop marketable production would be withheld
by handlers to meet their reserve obligations. 
The percentage of reserve almonds available for export is recommended at 0 percent. Although the order permits establishment
of a percentage of reserve almonds that could be exported, export is currently the largest market for California almonds
and is not considered a secondary or noncompetitive outlet. Therefore, exports would be included in trade demand
and the export market would not be an authorized reserve outlet.
All or part of reserve almonds could be released to the salable category if it is found that the supply made available
by the salable percentage is insufficient to satisfy 1994-95 trade demand needs, including desirable carryover
for use during the 1995-96 crop year. The Board is required to make any recommendations to the Secretary to increase
the salable percentage prior to May 15, 1995, pursuant to  981.48 of the order. Alternatively, all or a portion
of reserve almonds could be sold by the Board, or by handlers under agreement with the Board, to governmental agencies
or charitable institutions or for diversion into almond oil, almond butter, animal feed, or other outlets which the
Board finds are noncompetitive with existing normal markets for almonds. 
A tabulation of the estimates and calculations used by the Board in arriving at its recommendations follows:

The ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' (Guidelines) issued by the Department
in 1982 specify that 110 percent of recent years' sales be made available to primary markets each season. This rule
provides an estimated 656.4 million kernelweight pounds of California almonds for unrestricted sales (1994 crop
salable production plus carryin from the 1993 crop) to meet increasing domestic and world almond consumption demands.
This amount exceeds the actual 1991-92 record for delivered sales of California almonds by 18 percent. Thus,
the Guidelines' goals are met. 

The members of the Board that opposed the establishment of salable and reserve percentages believe that free competition
is best for the industry and that the industry should concentrate on building demand for almonds rather than imposing
a reserve. One member was also concerned that enforcement procedures would be difficult as many handlers are reluctant
to cooperate with a mandated reserve. 

The overall consensus of the Board is that the establishment of salable and reserve percentages will reduce market
volatility and enhance returns to growers, while stabilizing supplies to customers and encouraging customer confidence
in the industry. 

Establishment of salable and reserve percentages are often contentious and controversial in the almond industry.
Those opposed to reserves generally have philosophical differences with supporters, favoring a market situation
not affected by supply controls as reflected in the Board discussion and vote. However, a majority of the Board favored
the recommendation, and all Board members (even those opposed) have indicated they will support the majority Board
recommendation and work to ensure fair and equitable administration of the reserve, if established. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this proposed rule would not have
a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. 

Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is considered
appropriate because the salable and reserve percentages are recommended to be established for almonds received
by handlers during the 1994-95 crop year, which began on July 1, 1994.

Proposed Modification of Class D and Class E Airspace; Morgantown, WV


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes to revise controlled airspace in the vicinity of Morgantown, WV, due to the decommissioning
of the Bobtown, WV, non-directional radiobeacon (NDB), a proposed cancellation of an NDB or Global Positioning System
(GPS) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP), and a review of air traffic control procedures in the area.
Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``control zone
and transition area,'' and airspace designated from the surface to adjacent controlled airspace is now being described
as Class D and Class E airspace in this vicinity. The intended effect of this proposal is to modify controlled airspace
in this vicinity to that actually required for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Comments Invited

each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.


Availability of NPRM's


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Office of the
Assistant Chief Counsel, AEA-7, F.A.A. Eastern Region, Fitzgerald Federal Building 

#

111, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, NY 11430. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.


The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify controlled
airspace in the vicinity of Morgantown, WV, to reflect the proposed cancellation of the NDB or GPS Runway 18 SIAP, the
decommissioning of the Bobtown, WV, non-directional radiobeacon (NDB), and a review of air traffic control procedures
in the area. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``control
zone and transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface to overlying controlled airspace is now
being described as Class D & E airspace in this area. The intended effect of this proposal is to reflect that amount
of controlled airspace actually required for aircraft operations under instrument flight rules at the Morgantown
Municipal-Walter L. Bill Hart Field, WV. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum
83. Class D and Class E airspace areas extending upward from the surface and from 700 feet above ground level are published
in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, 6004, and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated
July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D &
E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that, when promulgated, this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Proposed Revision of Class E Airspace; New York, NY



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to establish additional Class E airspace at New York, NY. A Standard Instrument Approach Procedure
(SIAP) has been recently developed at the Teterboro Airport, NJ, and controlled airspace down to 700 feet above ground
level is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Teterboro Airport. The intended effect of this proposed
action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Comments Invited



Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above.
Commentors wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-AEA-01''.
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commentor. All communications received on or before the
specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained
in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the System Management Branch, AEA-530, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing
each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.



Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Office of the
Assistant Chief Counsel, AEA-7, F.A.A. Eastern Region, Fitzgerald Federal Building 

#

111, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, NY 11430. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 17) to establish additional
Class E airspace at New York, NY. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide additional controlled airspace
down to 700
' above ground level for IFR operations at Teterboro Airport, NJ. The coordinates for this airspace docket
are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B,
Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently
in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that, when promulgated, this proposed rule will not have significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Annual Marine Events within the Eighth Coast Guard District



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to establish permanent special local regulations for the annual marine events in the Eighth
Coast Guard District. This proposal would reduce the number of annual requests for temporary final rules for regattas
and marine parades and codifying these marine events in the Code of Federal Regulation would streamline the implementation
process.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Requests for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
08-94-019) and the specific section to which the comment applies, and give the reasons for concurrence
with or for any recommended changes to the proposal. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an
unbound format, no larger than 8 by 11 inches, suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons desiring acknowledgment
that their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of final action on this proposal.
Based upon the comments received the proposal may be changed.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Eighth Coast Guard District
Legal Office at the address under 

ADDRESSES

. The request should include the reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for
oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced
by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR T.P. Marian, Project Manager, and LT C.D. Michel,
Project Counsel.



Discussion of Proposed Rules



(a) Currently, Coast Guard units responsible for overseeing the safety of marine events prepare temporary rules
each year for each event. This rulemaking would eliminate the need to prepare annual temporary final rules for those
annual marine events that have few or no changes from year to year. If this rule is adopted, the rules would be effective
at the same time each year without need for temporary rules. The Coast Guard would issue event information in the Local
Notice to Mariners. This would streamline the marine event process for those regattas and marine events that have
very little annual variation and would significantly reduce the Coast Guard's administrative burden for managing
these type events.

The marine events requiring this regulation are regattas and marine parades that occur annually in the Eighth District
of the United States Coast Guard with little or no variation in location, time frame, and sponsors. Table 1 delineates
the events, their sponsors, dates, and locations. Each event occurs annually on or about the date given. The course
will be patrolled by patrol vessels. While viewing the event at any point outside the regulated area is not prohibited,
spectators will be encouraged to congregate within areas designated by the sponsor. Non-participating vessels
will be permitted to transit the area at 

NO WAKE SPEED

 at the discretion of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander.

Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This is attributed to the fact that the proposal merely codifies existing marine
events. Furthermore, each of the marine events in Table 1 will require that the navigable waterways delineated be
closed for only a short period of time. As demonstrated by past experience, these events have been successfully conducted
for several years in cooperation with both the organizers of these events and the boating public. The same event regulations
will be implemented for each marine event listed in Table 1 and the Coast Guard will continue to monitor these recurring
events in the interest of marine safety. Once the marine event is terminated the rule of the Coast Guard in monitoring
the marine event ceases. None of the marine events listed in Table 1 would exceed three days in duration and most of them
are for only several hours of one day. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal,
if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you
think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant
economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect it.


Collection of Information


This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


This proposed action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and it has been demonstrated that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


This regulation has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c. of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction
M16475.1B.


List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100


Marine safety, Navigation (water). Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Waterways.


Proposed Regulation


In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part 100 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations,
as follows:


PART 100_[AMENDED]


1. The authority citation for Part 100 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 33 U.S.C. 1233; 49 CFR 1.46 and 33 CFR 100.35.



2. A new  100.801 is added to read as follows:


 100.801

Annual Marine Events in the Eighth Coast Guard District.


The following regulations apply to the marine events listed in Table 1 of this section. These regulations will be effective
annually, for the duration of each event listed in Table 1. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the effective
period of the regulation with respect to each event, the geographical area, and details concerning the nature of the
event and the number of participants and type(s) of vessels involved will also be published in local notices to mariners.


Sponsors of events listed in Table 1 must submit an application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.
(a) The Coast Guard will patrol the event area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The
Patrol Commander may be contacted on Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) by the call sign ``PATCOM.''
(b) All persons and vessels not registered with the sponsor as participants or official patrol vessels are considered
spectators. The ``official patrol vessels'' consist of any Coast Guard, state or local law enforcement and sponsor
provided vessels assigned or approved by the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, to patrol the event.
(c) Spectator vessels desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander
and when so directed by that officer and will be operated at a no wake speed in a manner which will not endanger participants
in the event or any other craft.
(d) No spectator shall anchor, block, loiter, or impede the through transit of participants or official patrol vessels
in the regulated area during the effective dates and times, unless cleared for entry by or through an official patrol
vessel.
(e) The Patrol Commander may forbid and control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area. When hailed or signaled
by an official patrol vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the directions given. Failure
to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.
(f) Any spectator vessel may anchor outside the regulated area specified in Table 1, but may not anchor in, block, or
loiter in a navigable channel.
(g) The Patrol Commander may terminate the event or the operation of any vessel at any time it is deemed necessary for
the protection of life or property.
(h) The Patrol Commander will terminate enforcement of the special regulations at the conclusion of the event.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Sunset Beach, NC



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard is proposing to change the regulations
that govern the operation of the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach,
North Carolina. This proposal would restrict bridge openings in the month of November to help reduce highway traffic
congestion problems, public safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational
boat traffic. The proposed changes to these regulations are, to the extent practical and feasible, intended to provide
for regularly scheduled drawbridge openings to help reduce motor vehicle traffic delays and congestion on the roads
and highways linked by this drawbridge.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments




The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD05-94-050)
and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The Coast
Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic
filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt
of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Commander (ob) at the
address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice.


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Linda L. Gilliam, Project Manager, Bridge Section,
and LT Monica L. Lombardi, Project Counsel, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Background and Purpose



The North Carolina Department of Transportation has requested, on behalf of the Town of Sunset Beach, North Carolina,
that the drawbridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 337.9, at Sunset Beach, North Carolina, be further
restricted through the month of November. This would help to reduce highway traffic congestion problems, public
safety, and welfare concerns associated with frequent bridge openings caused by recreational boat traffic. Currently,
the drawbridge opens on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for pleasure vessels from April 1 to October 31. It opens on signal
at any time for vessels of the United States, State and local government vessels, commercial vessels, and any vessel
in an emergency involving danger to life or property. This proposal extends this schedule to November 30 with drawbridge
openings occurring on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation conducted a study of the drawlogs for this drawbridge for the month
of November and it revealed that the drawbridge opened 558 times in 1992 and 571 times in 1993. These openings exceeded
the openings for every other month during the same years. Based on this information, the Coast Guard believes these
proposed regulations will permit an orderly flow of recreational vessel traffic through the draw. This should not
unduly restrict recreational vessel passage through the bridge, since they can plan their vessel transits around
the hourly restriction.


Regulatory Evaluation



This proposed action is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from
review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this proposal will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

Security for Passenger Vessels and Passenger Terminals



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Reopening of comment period; Notice of public hearings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is reopening this rulemaking for comment in response to requests for further time to file comments
on the proposed rule. It is also holding three public hearings. These measures will ensure that the affected industry
has ample time to consider and comment on the proposed rule and will, to the maximum extent possible, ensure that the
Coast Guard receives the best available information on which to base any final action on this rulemaking.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On March 25, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 14290) proposing to establish equipment
standards, performance standards, and procedures for security against acts of terrorism on certain passenger vessels
and associated passenger terminals. Passenger vessels of over 100 gross tons carrying more than 12 passengers on
voyages of over 24 hours on the high seas and the associated passenger terminals would have been affected. These rules
appeared necessary because of a lack of voluntary compliance with measures of the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) published in 1986, or with these measures published as Coast Guard ``guidelines'' in 1987. 

In response to requests for further time to file comments on the proposed rule, the Coast Guard is reopening the comment
period through November 30, 1994. It is also holding three public hearings.



Written Comments



The notice of proposed rulemaking published on March 25, 1994, invited and encouraged interested persons to participate
in the rulemaking by submitting written comments, including views, data, and arguments, by June 23, 1994. Two organizations
representing multiple members of the affected industry sought further time to file comments, citing both the need
to assess current practices and compare them with the requirements in the proposed rule and the difficulty of preparing
meaningful responses within the original 90-day comment period. Because of these requests, the comment period is
reopened through November 30, 1994.

Comments should include the name and address of the person making them, identify this rulemaking [CGD 91-012]
and the specific section of the proposed rule to which each comment applies, and give reasons for each comment. Anyone
wishing an acknowledgment of receipt of comment should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard. The proposed
rule may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received during the comment period will be considered
before final action is taken on the proposed rule.



Public Hearing



Several parties sought public hearings so they could present spoken comments. The proposed rule was responsive to
the IMO's resolution in 1986 concerning security of passenger vessels and associated passenger terminals. In their
requests for public hearings, however, several parties alleged that the rule would have a significant, negative
effect on the passenger vessel industry and that they could state their cases better orally than in writing. Public
hearings will therefore be held on the dates and at the hours indicated above under DATES

 and at the sites indicated above under 

ADDRESSES.

Interested persons are invited to participate in these hearings. Each person wishing to make an oral statement should
register by Monday, September 12, 1994. Oral statements by any persons previously unregistered will be allowed only
if time permits. The Coast Guard reserves the right to impose time limits on oral presentations. It also reserves the
right to close parts of the meetings to enable candor in the treatment of security against acts of terrorism. To register,
write, telefax, or call the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G-LRA, 3406) [CGD 91-012], U.S.
Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001; telephone number (202) 267-1477,
telefax number (202) 267-0506.

Navy Acquisition Procedures Supplement; Payments Under Shipbuilding Contracts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Navy, DOD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is proposing to revise the shipbuilding progress payments clauses to incorporate several
provisions covering standard Federal Acquisition Regulation progress payment clause protections, clarifications
and expansions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background


The Department of the Navy has adopted procurement policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) [48 CFR] and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The
policies and procedures are known collectively as the Navy Acquisition Procedures Supplement (NAPS). Pursuant
to FAR 32.500(b), the Navy developed a shipbuilding progress payments clause for use in fixed price (FP) and fixed
price incentive (FI) contracts for construction or for shipbuilding or ship conversion, alteration, or repair,
when the contracts provide for progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. The shipbuilding progress
payments clauses are being revised primarily with the intent of incorporating controls, terms and provisions consistent
with those found in the clause at FAR 52.232-16, Progress Payments. 


B. Summary of Major Revisions 


(1) Definitions. Consolidates the FI clause definitions. 
(2) Computation of Payments. The proposed rule modifies the payment limitation of 100% of allowable costs to include
unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors. 
(3) Invoices. The proposed rule modifies the invoicing provision by requiring contractor certification of the amount
of unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors. 
(4) Physical Progress and Weighting Factors. The proposed rule modifies the physical progress and weighting factors
provision to give the Contracting Officer the unilateral right to establish the weighting factors if the contractor
and the Contracting Officer cannot reach agreement. 
(5) Incurred Costs. The proposed rule adds to the list of incurred costs exclusions, costs incurred by subcontractors
and suppliers; and capitalized costs and interim payments to subcontractors and suppliers. This provides consistency
with the FAR progress payments clause. The proposed rule also removes the small business provision that allows for
billing of material costs not paid for by the contractor. 
(6) Progress Payments to Subcontractors. The proposed rule adds a new section containing provisions from the FAR
progress payments clause that govern payments to subcontractors. 
(7) Liens and Title. A proposed provision is added which references Liens and Title provisions found elsewhere in
the contract. 
(8) Reduction and Suspension. The proposed rule adds a new section incorporating provisions from the FAR progress
payments clause that govern reductions and suspension of progress payments. 
(9) Limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from
the FAR progress payments clause that govern limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions. 
(10) Special Terms Regarding Default. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from the FAR progress
payments clause that govern treatment of progress payments in a contract default. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirement under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Supporting data requirements identified in the proposed rule include only data
already required to be maintained by shipbuilding contractors. 


D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Information 


The proposed rule will have no economic impact upon small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

. The shipbuilding progress payment clauses have been incorporated into applicable contracts since the early 1980's,
affecting all shipbuilders, large and small. The proposed NAPS rule will benefit the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors
by insuring uniform application and administration of progress payments. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility
analysis has been performed.

As prescribed in 32 CFR 5232.500, insert the following clause in fixed price solicitations and contracts for shipbuilding
or ship conversion, alteration, or repair, when progress payments are based on a percentage or stage of completion:



(Beginning of Clause) 


5252.232-9100 PAYMENTS (FP) (DEC 1992)



(a) 

Computation of payments. 
(1) Until such time as physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel is fifty percent (50%) complete, the
Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided,
will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, of ninety percent (90%) of the amount determined
by multiplying the total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress accomplished in the
performance of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the Supervisor; provided

, that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments previously made with respect
to such vessel under (i) paragraph (a) of this requirement and (ii) the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)''
requirement exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related
invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid
to subcontractors. 
(2) After the percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel has reached fifty percent (50%),
the Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided,
will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, of one hundred percent (100%) of the amount determined
by: (i) multiplying the total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress in the performance
of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the supervisor, and (ii) subtracting
from that product five percent (5%) of the total contract price of such vessel; 

provided

, that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments made previously with respect
to such vessel under paragraph (a) of this requirement 

and

 the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement exceeds one hundred five percent (105%) of the
allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work
on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors; 

provided, further

, that the Contractor furnishes data on actual cumulative costs and estimated future costs acceptable to the Supervisor
which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Supervisor that the Contractor will make a profit of at least five percent
(5%) on completion of the contract, and the Contractor provides updated information on a quarterly basis. If updated
data indicate the Contractor will 
not make a profit of at least five percent (5%) on completion of the contract, the progress payments shall be adjusted
retroactively so that the total of all payments made with respect to the vessel under paragraph (a) of this requirement
and the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%)
of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice to have been incurred in the performance
of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors or 100% of total contract price,
whichever is less. 
(b) 

Invoices

. Invoices may be submitted every two weeks, but not more frequently; 

provided,

 however, that if after contract award more frequent progress payments are approved by cognizant Government authority,
this requirement shall be modified accordingly without additional consideration by the Contractor to the Government
for such modification. No payment will be required to be made upon invoices aggregating less than five thousand dollars
($5,000). The Contractor shall certify on each invoice: 
(1) The percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on the vessel as a decimal carried to four places;
and 
(2) The allowable costs incurred in the performance of the work on the vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments
paid to subcontractors as of the date the invoice is submitted. Such certification shall provide for cost category
reporting in accordance with the Contractor's normal accounting system and shall be broken down into direct material,
direct labor, and indirect costs.

(c) 

Physical progress and weighting factors.

(1) Within sixty (60) days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit a progressing system description for
review and approval by the Contracting Officer. Upon approval of such system, progress payments shall be in accordance
with the approved system. Subsequent revisions to the approved system shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer
for approval prior to implementation. 

(2) The mutually agreed upon weighting factors for the categories of labor and material for each vessel are set forth
in Attachment___ to this contract. The weighting factors shall be revised quarterly. Notwithstanding the above,
revision of weighting factors may be requested by either party when factual data indicate that the weighting factors
then in use are no longer representative of the actual labor and material distribution. Revisions of weighting factors
shall be supported by detailed de-escalated (estimated final) direct material, direct labor, and indirect costs
and additional data concerning the cause of the change in the weighting factors. In the event that the parties fail
to agree on the establishment of, or a revision to the weighting factors, the Contracting Officer may establish on
a unilateral basis the weighting factors to be used in the administration of this provision. Any change in the weighting
factors shall be set forth in a Standard Form 30, ``Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract''. 

(d) Incurred costs.

 For the purpose of this requirement, ``incurred costs'' are those costs identified through the use of the accrual
method of accounting, as supported by the records maintained by the Contractor and which are allowable in accordance
with Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Part 231 of the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)
in effect on the effective date of this contract and include only: 

(1) The costs of supplies and services purchased by the Contractor directly for this contract may be included only
after payment by cash, check, or other form of actual payment. 

(2) Costs for the following may be included when incurred even if before payment, when the Contractor is not delinquent
in payment of costs of contract performance in the ordinary course of business: 

(i) Materials issued from the Contractor's stores inventory and placed in the production process for use on this contract;

(ii) Direct labor, direct travel, and other direct inhouse cost; 
(iii) Properly allocable and allowable indirect costs. 
(3) Accrued costs of Contractor contributions under employee pension or other post-retirement benefit, profit
sharing, and stock ownership plans shall not be considered incurred until actually paid unless_
(i) The Contractor's practice is to contribute to the plans quarterly or more frequently; and 
(ii) The contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end of the applicable quarter or shorter payment period.
(Any contributions remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total cost for progress payment limitations
until paid.) 
(4) Incurred costs shall not include: 
(i) Any costs that are required under any requirement of this contract (other than the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS
(LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement) to be reimbursed or paid by the Government to the Contractor or by the Contractor
to the Government other than through an equitable adjustment in the contract price; 
(ii) Costs incurred by subcontractors or suppliers; 
(iii) Costs ordinarily capitalized and subject to depreciation or amortization except for the properly depreciated
or amortized portion of such costs; 
(iv) Payments made or amounts payable to subcontractors or suppliers, except for_(A) Completed work, including
partial deliveries, to which the Contractor has acquired title; and (B) Work under cost-reimbursement or time-and-material
subcontracts to which the Contractor has acquired title. 

(5) If an overpayment is made relative to this paragraph (d), interest shall be charged at the prevailing per annum
rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to Public Law 92-41, from the date such overpayment
is made (date of Government check) until the date the overpayment if fully recovered. 
(e) 

Progress payments to subcontractors.

 Progress payments made by the Contractor to its subcontractors shall be the unliquidated progress payments that
are mentioned in (a)(1) and (a)(2) above shall be all progress payments to subcontractors or divisions, if the following
conditions are met: 

(1) The amounts included are limited to the unliquidated remainder of progress payments made. 

(2) The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve a minimum of approximately six months between
the beginning of work and the first delivery, or, if the subcontractor is a small business concern, four months. 

(3) The terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning progress payments_

(i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this provision or to the clause at 52.232-16, Progress Payments,
for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that
is a small business concern; 

(ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this clause; 

(iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this clause are to the Contractor; 

(iv) Are substantially in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
and 

(v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to which the Government has title under the subcontract
to the Government's right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the Contractor defaults or (B)
the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent. 

(4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on
whether the subcontractor is or is not a small business concern. 

(5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property to which title has vested in
the Government or against which a lien has been placed in favor of the Government under the subcontract terms, that
the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the Contractor
under this contract. 

(6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, but there are unliquidated progress payments
that the Contractor has made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the rights the Government
obtained through the terms required by this clause to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned
and transferred to the Contractor. 
(7) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting under this contract, the Contractor agrees to
provide progress payments to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary progress payments
stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
The Contractor further agrees that the need for such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse
factor in the award of subcontracts. 

(f) 

Retentions. 

(1) Upon preliminary acceptance of each vessel and upon the submission of properly certified invoices, the Government
will pay to the Contractor the amount withheld under paragraph (a) of this requirement in respect of that vessel in
excess of (i) a performance reserve in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the total contract price for
such vessel, or (ii) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), whichever is greater. If at any time it shall appear
to the Government that the amount of performance reserve may be insufficient to meet the cost to the Government of finishing
any unfinished work under the contract for which the Contractor is responsible, or of correcting defects for which
the Contractor is responsible which are discovered prior to preliminary acceptance or during the guaranty period
of any vessel, the Government may, in making payments under this requirement, deduct or withhold such additional
amounts as it may determine to be necessary to render such reserve adequate; provided,

 that any additional amounts deducted or withheld on account of defects which are discovered during the guaranty period
of the vessel shall not exceed the limit of the Contractor's liability as set forth in the requirement entitled LIMITATION
OF CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY FOR CORRECTION OF DEFECTS'', reduced by the amounts of the cost incurred by the Contractor
for work on such vessel because of Contractor responsible deficiencies which are discovered during the guaranty
period of the vessel. 

(2) The Government may, in its discretion, make payments prior to final settlement on account of the reserves established
under this requirement, subject to such conditions precedent as the Contracting Officer may prescribe. 

(3) The Government shall, at the time of final settlement, in accordance with the provisions of the requirement entitled
``FINAL SETTLEMENT'', pay the Contractor the balance owing to it under the contract promptly after the amount of such
balance shall have been determined. 

(g) 

Liens and title

. For liens and title provisions, see the requirement of this contract entitled ``LIENS AND TITLE''. 

(h) 

Certifications and audits.

 At any time or times prior to final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may have any invoices and statements
or certifications of costs audited. The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to submit, or make available
for examination by the Contracting Officer or his designated representative, the supporting documentation upon
which invoices, statements or certifications of costs are based. Each payment theretofore made shall be subject
to reduction as necessary to reflect the exclusion of amounts included in the invoices or statements or certifications
of costs which are found by the Contracting Officer, on the basis of such audit, not to constitute allowable costs.
Any payment may be reduced for overpayments, or increased for underpayments on preceding invoices. 

(i) 

Reduction or suspension.

 The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend progress payments after finding on substantial evidence of any of the
following conditions: 
(1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract. 
(2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory
financial condition. 
(3) Inventory allocated to this contract substantially exceeds reasonable requirements. 
(4) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of the costs of performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.

(5) The Contractor fails to maintain an efficient and reliable accounting system and controls adequate for the proper
administration of progress payments. 
(j) 

Limitations on undefinitized contract actions. 

Notwithstanding any other progress payment provisions in this contract, progress payments may not exceed 90 percent
of costs incurred on work accomplished under undefinitized contract actions. A ``contract action'' is any action
resulting in a contract, as defined in subpart 2.1, including contract 
modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including contract modifications that are within the
scope and under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the ``CHANGES'' clause,
or funding and other administrative changes. This limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in accordance
with paragraph (d) of this clause, and shall remain in effect until the contract action is definitized. Costs incurred
which are subject to this limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests and invoices from
those costs eligible for higher progress payment rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, progress
payments for undefinitized contract actions shall be liquidated at 90 percent of the amount invoiced for work performed
under the undefinitized contract action as long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of unliquidated
progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall not exceed 90 percent of the maximum liability of the
Government under the undefinitized contract action or such lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract. Separate
limits may be specified for separate actions. 
(k) 

Special terms regarding default. 

If this contract is terminated under the ``DEFAULT'' clause, (i) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government
the amount of unliquidated progress payments and (ii) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of progress
payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to require delivery under the ``DEFAULT'' clause.
The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the ``DEFAULT'' clause.

Payments (FI).


As prescribed in  5232.500, insert the following clause in fixed price incentive solicitations and contracts
for shipbuilding or ship conversion, alteration, or repair, when progress payments are based on a percentage or stage
of completion: 


(Beginning of Clause) 


5252.232-9105 PAYMENTS (FI) (DEC 1992)



(a) 

Definitions. 

For purposes of this contract requirement, the following definitions apply: 
(1) 

Total contract price_

the sum of the contract prices including, adjustments as set forth in paragraphs (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this clause and
paragraph (c) of this clause, for each item in this contract subject to the requirement entitled, ``INCENTIVE PRICE
REVISION_FIRM TARGET''. 
(2) 

Original unit target price

_the target price of each item in this contract subject to the requirement entitled, ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION_FIRM
TARGET'', that was established at the time of contract award. 
(3) 

Original total target price

_the sum of the target 
prices of each item in this contract subject to the requirement 
entitled, ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION_FIRM TARGET'', that were 
established at the time of contract award. 
(4) 

Allocated total contract price

_that portion of the total contract price which is assigned to an item in the contract subject to the requirement entitled,
``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION_ FIRM TARGET''. The allocated total contract price of each item shall be established
by multiplying the total contract price by a percentage, expressed as a decimal carried to four decimal places, equal
to that fraction whose numerator is the original unit target price of the vessel and whose denominator is the original
total target price. The resulting dollar amount shall be rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000),
upward or downward; provided that in no event shall the sum of the allocated total contract price of the items exceed
the total contract price. The aforesaid percentages of each item shall be revised, by contract modification, in the
event that either: 
(i) Equitable adjustments to the unit target prices of the items result in unit target prices of a substantially different
proportion to the total target prices than previously provided for under this subparagraph (a)(4); or

(ii) Incurred costs indicate that a revision to the percentages is appropriate; 

provided, however, 

any such revision shall not be made more frequently than at the end of a calendar quarter unless the total contract price
is limited to the contract ceiling price and the contract ceiling price is adjusted during the calendar quarter. 
(b) 

Computation of payments. 
(1) Until such time as physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel is fifty percent (50%) complete, the
Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided,
will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, of ninety percent (90%) of the amount determined
by multiplying the allocated total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress accomplished
in the performance of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the Supervisor;
provided,

 that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments previously made with respect
to such vessel under (i) paragraph (b) of this requirement and (ii) the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)''
requirement exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related
invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid
to subcontractors. 
(2) After the percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on a vessel has reached fifty percent (50%),
the Government, upon submission by the Contractor of invoices certified by the Contractor as hereinafter provided,
will promptly make payments, on account of the total contract price, at one hundred percent (100%) of the amount determined
by: (i) multiplying the allocated total contract price of such vessel by the percentage of physical progress accomplished
in the performance of work on such vessel as certified by the Contractor subject to the approval of the Supervisor,
and (ii) subtracting from that product five percent (5%) of the allocated total contract price of such vessel; 

provided

, that no such payment shall be made in an amount which when added to the total of all payments made previously with respect
to such vessel under paragraph (b) of this requirement and the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)''
requirement exceeds one hundred five percent (105%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related
invoice to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid
to subcontractors; 

provided, further

, that the Contractor furnishes data on actual cumulative costs and estimated future costs acceptable to the Supervisor
which demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Supervisor that the Contractor will make a profit of at least five percent
(5%) on completion of the contract, and the Contractor provides updated information on a quarterly basis. If updated
data indicate the Contractor will not make a profit of at least five percent (5%) on completion of the contract, the
progress payments shall be adjusted retroactively so that the total of all payments made with respect to the vessel
under paragraph (b) of this requirement and the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement
shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the allowable costs certified by the Contractor on the related invoice
to have been incurred in the performance of work on such vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors
or 100% of the total contract price, whichever is less. 
(c) 

Billing price.


(1) For the purpose of this requirement, until the establishment of the total final price in accordance with paragraph
(d) of the ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION (FIRM TARGET)'' requirement, the term ``total contract price'' means the billing
price; initially the billing price shall be the initial total contract target price, and thereafter the billing price
shall be revised as provided in paragraph (c)(2) below. After establishment of the total final price in accordance
with paragraph (d) of the ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION (FIRM TARGET)'' requirement, the billing price shall be the
total final price so established. 
(2) Within fifteen (15) days after each calendar quarter, the Contractor shall submit in writing a proposed revised
billing price which shall be established as follows:

<DOCNO> FR940907-1-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The Contractor shall certify to the Contracting Officer the percentage of physical progress in the performance
of the contract as a whole as of the end of the calendar quarter. Such percentage of physical progress shall be expressed
as a decimal carried to four decimal places and shall be subject to the approval of the Supervisor. 
(ii) The revised billing price shall be the sum of a projected final cost, and a projected profit, computed as follows:

(A) A projected final cost shall be computed by (1) determining the cumulative sum of the base costs as of the end of the
calendar quarter, established in accordance with the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement,
and (2) dividing the sum thereof by the percentage of physical progress certified and approved as set forth in subparagraph
(i) above. 
(B) A projected profit shall be determined by applying, to the projected final cost, the incentive formula set forth
in paragraph (d)(2) of the ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION_FIRM TARGET'' requirement; 

provided,

 that in no event shall the revised billing price exceed the ceiling price of the contract. 
(iii) The revised billing price determined as stated above shall be set forth separately in a supplemental agreement
to this contract, which also shall set forth the computations upon which the revision of the billing price is based.

(iv) Any revision of the billing prices shall not affect the determination of the total final price under paragraph
(d) of the ``INCENTIVE PRICE REVISION_FIRM TARGET'' requirement. After execution of the contract modification
referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of said requirement, the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers
shall be adjusted to reflect the total final price, and any additional payments, refunds or credits resulting therefrom
shall be promptly made. 
(d) 

Invoices.

 Invoices may be submitted every two weeks, but not more frequently; 

provided, however,

 that if after contract award more frequent progress payments are approved by cognizant Government authority, this
provision shall be modified accordingly without additional consideration by the Contractor to the Government for
such modification. No payment will be required to be made upon invoices aggregating less than five thousand dollars
($5,000). The Contractor shall certify on each invoice: 
(1) the percentage of physical progress in the performance of work on the vessel as a decimal carried to four places;
and 
(2) the allowable costs incurred in the performance of the work on the vessel plus any unliquidated progress payments
paid to subcontractors as of the date the invoice is submitted. Such certification shall provide for cost category
reporting in accordance with the Contractor's normal accounting system and shall be broken down into direct material,
direct labor, and indirect costs. 
(e) 

Physical progress and weighting factors. 
(1) Within sixty (60) days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit a progressing system description for
review and approval by the Contracting Officer. Upon approval of such system, progress payments shall be in accordance
with the approved system. Subsequent revisions to the approved system shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer
for approval prior to implementation. 
(2) The mutually agreed upon weighting factors for the categories of labor and material for each vessel are set forth
in Attachment 

XXXX

 to this contract. The weighting factors shall be revised quarterly concurrent with the billing price revisions specified
in paragraph (c). Notwithstanding the above, revision of weighting factors may be requested by either party when
factual data indicate that the weighting factors then in use are no longer representative of the actual labor and material
distribution. Revisions of weighting factors shall be supported by detailed de-escalated (estimated final) direct
material, direct labor, and indirect costs and additional data concerning the cause of the change in the weighting
factors. In the event that the parties fail to agree on the establishment of, or a revision to the weighting factors,
the Contracting Officer may establish on a unilateral basis the weighting factors to be used in the administration
of this provision. Any change in the weighting factors shall be set forth in a Standard Form 30, ``Amendment of Solicitation/Modification
of Contract''. 
(f) 

Incurred costs.

 For the purpose of this requirement, ``incurred costs'' are those costs identified through the use of the accrual
method of accounting, as supported by the records maintained by the Contractor and which are allowable in accordance
with Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Part 231 of the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS)
in effect on the effective date of this contract and include only: 
(1) The costs of supplies and services purchased by the Contractor directly for this contract may be included only
after payment by cash, check, or other form of actual payment. 
(2) Costs for the following may be included when incurred even if before payment, when the Contractor is not delinquent
in payment of the costs of contract performance in the ordinary course of business: 
(i) Materials issued from the Contractor's stores inventory and placed in the production process for use on this contract;

(ii) Direct labor, direct travel, and other direct in-house costs; 
(iii) Properly allocable and allowable indirect costs. 
(3) Accrued costs of Contractor contributions under employee pension or other post-retirement benefit, profit
sharing, and stock ownership plans shall not be considered incurred until actually paid unless_
(i) the Contractor's practice is to contribute to the plans quarterly or more frequently; and 
(ii) the contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end of the applicable quarter or shorter payment period.
(Any contributions remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total cost for progress payment limitations
until paid.)

(4) Incurred costs shall not include: 
(i) Any costs that are required under any requirement of this contract (other than the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS
(LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement) to be reimbursed or paid by the Government to the Contractor or by the Contractor
to the Government other than through an equitable adjustment in the contract price; 
(ii) Costs incurred by subcontractors or suppliers; 
(iii) Costs ordinarily capitalized and subject to depreciation or amortization except for the properly depreciated
or amortized portion of such costs; 
(iv) Payments made or amounts payable to subcontractors or suppliers, except for_(A) Completed work, including
partial deliveries, to which the Contractor has acquired title; and (B) Work under cost-reimbursement or time-and-material
subcontracts to which the Contractor has acquired title. 
(5) If an overpayment is made relative to this paragraph (f), interest shall be charged at the prevailing per annum
rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to Public Law 92-41, from the date such overpayment
is made (date of Government check) until the date the overpayment is fully recovered. 
(g) 

Progress payments to subcontractors

. Progress payments made by the Contractor to its subcontractors shall be the unliquidated progress payments paid
to subcontractors that are mentioned in (b)(1) and (b)(2), if the following conditions are met: 
(1) The amounts included are limited to the unliquidated remainder of progress payments made. 
(2) The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve a minimum of approximately six months between
the beginning of work and the first delivery, or, if the subcontractor is a small business concern, four months. 
(3) The terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning progress payments_
(i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this provision or to the clause at FAR 52.232-16, Progress Payments,
for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that
is a small business concern; 
(ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this requirement; 
(iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this requirement are to the Contractor;

(iv) Are substantially in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
and 
(v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to which the Government has title under the subcontract
to the Government's right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the Contractor defaults or (B)
the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent. 
(4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on
whether the subcontractor is or is not a small business concern. 
(5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property to which title has vested in
the Government or against which a lien has been placed in favor of the Government under the subcontract terms, that
the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the Contractor
under this contract. 
(6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, but there are unliquidated progress payments
that the Contractor has made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the rights the Government
obtained through the terms required by this requirement to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned
and transferred to the Contractor. 
(7) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting under this contract, the Contractor agrees to
provide progress payments to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary progress payments
stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
The Contractor further agrees that the need for such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse
factor in the award of subcontracts. 
(h) 

Retentions

. 
(1) Upon preliminary acceptance of each vessel and upon the submission of properly certified invoices, the Government
will pay to the Contractor the amount withheld under paragraph (b) of this requirement in respect of that vessel in
excess of (i) a performance reserve in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the allocated total contract
price for such vessel, or (ii) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), whichever is greater. If at any time it shall
appear to the Government that the amount of performance reserve may be insufficient to meet the cost to the Government
of finishing any unfinished work under the contract for which the Contractor is responsible, or of correcting defects
for which the Contractor is responsible which are discovered prior to preliminary acceptance or during the guaranty
period of any vessel, the Government may, in making payments under this requirement, deduct or withhold such additional
amounts as it may determine to be necessary to render such reserve adequate; 

provided

, that any additional amounts deducted or withheld on account of defects which are discovered during the guaranty
period of the vessel shall not exceed the limit of the Contractor's liability as set forth in the requirement entitled
``LIMITATION OF CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY FOR CORRECTION OF DEFECTS'', reduced by the amounts of the cost incurred
by the Contractor for work on such vessel because of Contractor responsible deficiencies which are discovered during
the guaranty period of the vessel.

(2) The Government may, at its discretion, make payments prior to final settlement on account of the reserves established
under this requirement, subject to such conditions precedent as the Contracting Officer may prescribe. 
(3) The Government shall, at the time of final settlement, in accordance with the provisions of the requirement entitled
``FINAL SETTLEMENT'', pay the Contractor the balance owing to it under the contract promptly after the amount of such
balance shall have been determined. 
(i) 

Liens and title

. For liens and title provisions, see the requirement of this contract entitled ``LIENS AND TITLE''. 
(j) 

Certifications and audits

. At any time or times prior to final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may have any invoices and
statements or certifications of costs audited. The Contracting officer may require the Contractor to submit, or
make available for examination by the Contracting Officer or his designated representative, the supporting documentation
upon which invoices, statements or certifications of costs are based. Each payment theretofore made shall be subject
to reduction as necessary to reflect the exclusion of amounts included in the invoices or statements or certifications
of costs which are found by the Contracting Officer, on the basis of such audit, not to constitute allowable costs.
Any payment may be reduced for overpayments, or increased for underpayments on preceding invoices. 
(k) 

Reduction or suspension

. The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend progress payments after finding on substantial evidence of any of
the following conditions: 
(1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract. 
(2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory
financial condition. 
(3) Inventory allocated to this contract substantially exceeds reasonable requirements. 
(4) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of the costs of performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.

(5) The Contractor fails to maintain an efficient and reliable accounting system and controls adequate for the proper
administration of progress payments. 
(l) 

Limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions

. Notwithstanding any other progress payment provisions in this contract, progress payments may not exceed 90 percent
of costs incurred on work accomplished under undefinitized contract actions. A ``contract action'' is any action
resulting in a contract, as defined in subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for additional supplies or
services, but not including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract,
such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the CHANGES clause, or funding and other administrative changes.
This limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this requirement,
and shall remain in effect until the contract action is definitized. Costs incurred which are subject to this limitation
shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress
payments rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, progress payments for undefinitized contract actions
shall be liquidated at 90 percent of the amount invoiced for work performed under the undefinitized contract action
as long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of unliquidated progress payments for undefinitized
contract actions shall not exceed 90 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under the undefinitized contract
action or such lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract. Separate limits may be specified for separate actions.

(m) 

Special terms regarding default

. If this contract is terminated under the ``DEFAULT'' clause, (1) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government
the amount of unliquidated progress payments and (2) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of progress
payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to require delivery under the ``DEFAULT'' clause.
The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the ``DEFAULT'' clause.

Qualification of Pipeline Personnel



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Transportation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting and extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) invites representatives of industry, state and local government,
and the public to an open meeting on qualifications of pipeline personnel. The purpose of this meeting is to hear views
of interested persons on issues raised as a result of a recently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding
qualifications of pipeline personnel. The comment period is also being extended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 3, 1994, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), (59 FR 39506), that proposed requirements
on pipeline operators to qualify pipeline personnel who perform, or directly supervise those persons performing,
regulated operation, maintenance and emergency response functions. This action would amend current standards
for training personnel performing operating or maintenance activities on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines,
and extend those standards to personnel performing similar functions on gas pipelines. This action was taken to ensure
that pipeline personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently perform these regulated functions.
The intended effect of this proposed rulemaking is to improve pipeline safety by requiring operators to assure the
competency of pipeline personnel through training, testing and periodic refresher training. 



Certain parties have stated a desire to confer with RSPA regarding the issues the NPRM presented. Accordingly, RSPA
has determined that a public meeting is appropriate to receive additional comments for consideration in preparing
the final rule. The purpose of the meeting is to hear views and receive information from the public. In addition, RSPA
officials may ask clarifying questions. 

Interested persons are invited to attend the meeting and present oral or written statements on matters raised by the
NPRM. Any person who wishes to speak should notify Daphen&eacute; Floyd at (202) 366-1640. Please estimate
the time that will be needed to speak. RSPA reserves the right to limit the time of each speaker, if necessary, to ensure
that everyone who requests an opportunity to speak is given one. Individuals that are not scheduled to comment will
have an opportunity to comment only after approval of the meeting officer.

The comment period is extended until October 31, 1994, because the close of the initial comment period follows immediately
after this meeting. Therefore, commenters may not have sufficient time to include information from this public meeting
in their comments.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Taxonomic Change of Erigeron Maguirei var. Maguirei (Maguire
Daisy) to Erigeron Maguirei (Maguire Daisy); Proposal To Reclassify From Endangered to Threatened Status


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The plant 

Erigeron maguirei

 (Maguire daisy) previously included two recognized varieties: 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei,

 listed as endangered in 1985, and 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii,

 a category 2 candidate species. A recent taxonomic revision has synonymized these two plant varieties into one species,


E. maguirei,

 because morphological differences that were previously used to distinguish between the two varieties have been
determined to be ecotypic and not genetically fixed. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) accepts this taxonomic
revision, and proposes to change the endangered 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 to 

E. maguirei

 and to reclassify it to threatened status under the authority of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended
(16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

). 

Erigeron maguirei 

is endemic to sandstone canyons and mesas in the San Rafael Swell in Emergy County, Utah, and the Capitol Reef in Wayne
County, Utah. This species is found in small populations and portions of its habitat are subjected to adverse effects
from mineral and recreational development and livestock grazing. A determination that 

E. maguirei

 is a threatened species would continue to provide this species protection under the authority of the Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



The genus 

Erigeron

 (composite family, Asteraceae) includes the Maguire daisy (

E. maguirei

) and about 200 other species (Cronquist 1947). Most of these species are found in the Western Hemisphere, and the Western
United States is their present center of distribution. The Maguire daisy is a perennial, herbaceous plant. Its stems
are decumbent to sprawling or erect and 7 to 18 cm (2.76 to 7.09 in) in height. The basal leaves are spatulate or broadly
oblanceolate in outline, 2 to 5 cm (0.79 to 1.97 in) long and 0.6 to 0.9 cm (0.24 to 0.35 in) wide. Its cauline leaves are
sessile or short-petiolate, alternately arranged on the stem, and they are well developed. The leaves are slightly
reduced towards the tip, i.e., oblanceolate becoming lanceolate or narrowly ellipsoid apically. Both the leaves
and stems are copiously covered with a spreading hirsute pubescence. One to three flower heads are borne at the end
of each stem. The floral disc is 8 to 10 mm (0.32 to 0.39 in) wide; the involucre is 5 to 6.5 mm (0.20 to 0.26 in) high. Each
floral head has 15 to 20 white or pinkish white colored ligules (ray flowers) about 6 to 8 mm (0.24 to 0.32 in) long and
1.5 to 2 mm (0.06 to 0.08 in) wide. The disk flowers are orange, about 3.5 to 3.8 mm (0.14 to 0.15 in) long. The seeds are
2-nerved achenes. (Cronquist 1947; Welsh 1983a, 1983b; Welsh et al. 1987).


Erigeron maguirei

 was described by Cronquist (1947) from a 1940 specimen collected by Dr. Bassett Maguire from Calf Canyon in the San
Rafael Swell, Emery County, Utah. 

Erigeron maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 was first discovered at Hickman Natural Bridge in the Capitol Reef of Wayne County, Utah, by Dr. Bertrand Harrison
in 1936, and it was finally described by Welsh (1983a) from a specimen that he collected in 1982. However, Welsh postulated
that the morphological variations between 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 in the San Rafael Swell and 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 from the Capitol Reef may represent only ecotypic variation (Welsh 1983a, 1983b; Welsh et al. 1987). Heil (1989) reported
both varieties from Capitol Reef and postulated that 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 was an ecotypic shade variant of 

E. maguirei.

 Using DNA analysis, VanBuren (1993) demonstrated that 

E. maguirei 

var. 

maguirei

 and 

E. maguirei 

var. 

harrisonii

 were of the same taxonomic entity and that separation of the two at the varietal level was not warranted. This finding
was of great interest to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), since 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 was listed as an endangered species at that time.
Recent status surveys of endangered, threatened, and other rare plant species in the San Rafael Swell (Kass 1990)
and Capitol Reef (Heil 1989) have shown a total population of about 3,000 

E. maguirei

 plants in five populations that occur on both Federal and State lands. Although combining the two varieties into one
type increased the total number of plants in the wild, 

E. maguirei

 still remains vulnerable to threats due to the loss of habitat.

Small and restricted populations of 

E. maguirei

 make this species vulnerable to alterations of its habitat. The plant already has been adversely affected by off-road
vehicles and trampling by humans and livestock. Other potential threats to the species are due to mineral and energy
exploration and development. The demographic stability of the various populations of the species is not well known,
but some of the smaller populations may be at levels too low to ensure their long term survival. Although the effects
of natural factors such as disease, parasitism, grazing by native species, natural erosion, and vegetative competition
are usually not threatening to this species, any further losses in its existing numbers even may make natural conditions
threatening.
Section 12 of the Act directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered
to be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented
to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 

FR

 27823) of its acceptance of the report as a petition to list those taxa named therein under Section 4(c)(2) of the Act
(petition acceptance is now governed by Section 4(b)(3) of the Act), and 

E. maguirei

 was included in the July 1, 1975, notice on list ``A'' as endangered.


Erigeron maguirei

 was proposed by the Service for listing as endangered along with some 1,700 other vascular plant taxa on June 16, 1976
(41 

FR

 24523). General comments received on the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 

FR

 17909). The 1978 amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn, but proposals published
before the date of enactment of the 1978 amendments could not be withdrawn before the end of a 1-year grace period beginning
on the date of enactment. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice of withdrawal of that portion of the June
16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final (44 

FR

 70796) which included 

E. maguirei.
The July 1975 notice was updated by a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1980 (45 

FR

 82480), and that notice included 

E. maguirei

 is a category 1species. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service presently has significant biological information
to support a proposal to list them as endangered or threatened. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 1982 amendments to the Act
requires that the Secretary of the Interior make findings on certain petitions within 1 year of their receipt. Section
2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments to the Act further required that all petitions pending as of October 13, 1982, be treated
as having been newly submitted on that date. Since the 1975 Smithsonian report was accepted as a petition, all the taxa
contained in those notices, including 

E. maguirei,

 were treated as being newly petitioned as of October 13, 1982. The deadline for a finding on such petitions, including
that for 

E. maguirei,

 was October 13, 1983. On October 13, 1983, the Service made a 1-year finding that the petition to list the Maguire daisy
was warranted, but precluded by other listing actions of higher priority. On July 27, 1984, the Service published
a proposed rule proposing 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 as an endangered species (49 

FR

 30211) and published a final rule designating the species as endangered on September 5, 1985 (50 

FR

 36090).
On September 27, 1985, the Service published a notice of review (50 

FR

 39526) replacing the 1980 notice and its 1983 supplement. This notice of review included 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 as a category 2 species. Category 2 comprises taxa for which the Service has information indicating that it may be appropriate
to propose to list the taxa as endangered or threatened but that more substantial data are needed on biological vulnerability
and threats to the species. The 1985 notice of review was replaced by the January 27, 1990 notice of review (55 

FR

 6184), which was replaced by the September 30, 1993, notice of review (58 

FR

 51144). Both notices retained 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 as a category 2 candidate species.
Recent status surveys and taxonomic evaluations (Heil 1989; Van Buren 1993; R. VanBuren, Brigham Young University,
1993, pers. comm.; Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) indicate that the varieties 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 and 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 are synonymous with 

E. maguirei

. Synonymizing the two varieties into a full species results in 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii 

being removed from the candidate species list.


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species


Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

E. maguirei

 (Maguire daisy) are as follows:


A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



Due to its inaccessible habitat, there are few threats to the populations of this daisy that occur on Bureau of Land
Management (Bureau) lands. Livestock trampling has affected populations of this plant both in and outside of Capitol
Reef National Park (the Park is not closed to livestock grazing). Off-road and foot traffic within the Park have affected
one known population of 

E. maguirei

. The range within which 

E. maguirei

 occurs is known to contain uranium ore deposits. The development of these deposits, and surface disturbance by annual
assessment work on mineral claims for uranium and possibly other minerals, have the potential to adversely impact
this species and its habitat.


B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes


None known.

<TEXT>
 

C. Disease or Predation




Erigeron maguirei

 is vulnerable to livestock grazing and trampling. The effect of livestock grazing on the condition of the desert vegetation
needs to be evaluated to determine if there are any impacts on the 

E. maguirei

 populations.


D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms


The Act currently provides protection to 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 as an endangered species. This protection would also continue for 

E. maguirei

 as a threatened species.


E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence


There are few threats to populations of 

E. maguirei

 on Bureau lands because of their inaccessibility. The known populations are remote and it would require maximum effort
by individuals in vehicles or on foot to gain access to these plant locales. Off road vehicles could pose a remote threat
to this daisy. But due to its low numbers (about 3,000 specimens), the species could be vulnerable to any human disturbance.
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list 

E. maguirei

 as a threatened species. With less than 3,000 plants remaining in only five known populations, the Service has determined
that the species remains vulnerable to habitat destruction. A portion of the species' population is protected from
some threats within Capitol Reef National Park, but even within the Park there are significant threats. The Service
finds that 

E. maguirei

 is not in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and therefore does not meet the
requirements to be listed as endangered. However, the plant is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable
future if the present threats and declines continue. Threatened status is an accurate assessment of the species'
present condition. For the reasons given below, it is not prudent at this time to propose critical habitat.


Critical Habitat


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent possible, the Secretary propose critical
habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical
habitat is not prudent at this time for 

E. maguirei

 because this designation might result in increased taking of the species. Designation of critical habitat would
entail publication of a detailed description and map of its habitat in the 

Federal Register

, thus exposing the species to the threat of vandalism. A person could easily vandalize the small populations of this
daisy with aid of an off-road vehicle.
Moreover, few additional benefits would be provided to the species by the critical habitat designation which are
not already provided by listing the species. Also most of the plants are located on lands under Federal jurisdiction.
Any Federal action that would impact the plant or its habitat would be addressed through Section 7 consultation. Section
9(a)(2)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful to remove and reduce to possession any threatened species of plant from areas
under Federal jurisdiction. The National Park Service and the Bureau are aware of the occurrence of 

E. maguirei

 on Federal lands and what their obligations for protection of this plant are under the Act. Protection of this species'
habitat also will be accomplished through the recovery process.


Available Conservation Measures


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, citizens
groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and joint cooperation with the States, and
it requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal Agencies
and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.
Most of these daisies occur on Federal lands managed by the Bureau with remainder on Capitol Reef National Park. Both
of these Federal Agencies are responsible for ensuring that all activities and actions on lands they manage are not
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of this daisy.
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72 for threatened species set forth a series of
general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all threatened plants. All prohibitions of Section 9(a)(2) of
the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course
of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale this species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce
to possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened
plants are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers.
The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving
threatened species under certain circumstances. Because of limited horticultural interest in wild daisies, including


E. maguirei

, trade permits may be sought, but few, if any, trade permits for plants of wild origin ever would be issued since the
species is not common in the wild. If plants of cultivated origin are available, permits may, under certain circumstances,
be issued for trade in them. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed
to the Office of Management Authority, Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, Virginia 22203-3507
(703/358-2104).


Public Comments Solicited


The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions concerning this proposed rule are hereby sought from the public, other governmental
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party. Comments are particularly sought
concerning:

Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional
information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs significantly
from this proposal.
The Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date
of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the Field Supervisor, Ecological Services,
Fish and Wildlife Service, Salt Lake City, Utah (see

National Environmental Policy Act


The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Act,
as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') today is publishing for comment proposals to require disclosure
with respect to security ratings in prospectuses under the Securities Act of 1933 and material changes in security
ratings on Form 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposals specify the disclosure necessary
with respect to ratings, whether disclosed voluntarily or pursuant to the new requirements. Today's proposals are
intended to improve the quality and timeliness of security ratings disclosures provided to investors and the financial
markets in prospectuses and periodic reports, and to reduce the potential for market misunderstanding and confusion
over the scope and meaning of security ratings. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission is publishing for comment proposed Item 202(g) of Regulation 
S-K
 and proposed Item 202(d) of Regulation S-B
 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'')


 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')
 to require disclosure of solicited security ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(``NRSROs'') to registered securities or any rating, whether or not assigned by an NRSRO, that is used by a participant
in the offering, and to mandate the disclosure necessary in connection with any discussion of ratings, voluntary
or required, in prospectuses. The Commission also is publishing for comment new Item 9 of Form 8-K
 under the Exchange Act to require disclosure of material rating changes. The Commission is proposing to rescind its
policy on voluntary security ratings disclosure set forth in Section 10 of Regulations S-K and S-B,
 and is proposing technical amendments to Rules 134(a)(14),

 430A,
 and 436(g)
 under the Securities Act. 












I. Background 


A. Disclosure of Security Ratings_Current Policy 


In 1981, the Commission, recognizing the importance of security ratings to investors and to the marketplace, reversed
its historic policy of precluding disclosure of security ratings in registration statements, prospectuses, and
other offering documents.
 The Commission adopted a policy that permits, but that does not require, issuers to disclose in Commission filings
security ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities,
and preferred stock. 





The policy distinguishes between security ratings assigned by NRSROs and those assigned by other rating organizations.
 The most significant distinction is the provision allowing the inclusion of a security rating by an NRSRO in a registration
statement without having to provide a written consent from the NRSRO to be named as an expert for purposes of Section
11 of the Securities Act.
 Any non-NRSRO rating organization must furnish a consent and take on expert liability under the Securities Act if
its rating is included in the registration statement and prospectus.
 In addition, under the policy, issuers may disclose a rating in tombstone advertisements on a limited basis, provided
that the rating is assigned by an NRSRO.
 As part of the same initiative, the Commission incorporated eligibility criteria based on ratings by NRSROs into
its short form registration forms under the Securities Act.
 In doing so, the Commission noted that investment grade securities typically were purchased on the basis of interest
rates and ratings.
 










Underlying the Commission's change in policy and the disclosure guidance it provided in its policy statement was
an understanding of rating practices and disclosures as they had developed through the 1970s. In announcing the policy,
the Commission noted the significance and usefulness of security ratings, as shown by the use of ratings ``by investors,
by market professionals in establishing the appropriate price and yield for a particular security and by regulatory
bodies, including the Commission.''

The security ratings encompassed by the Commission's policy were understood generally to be credit ratings. In the
release announcing the policy, the Commission noted that the typical security rating at the time was ``an alphabetical
designation which attempts to quantify the likelihood that an issuer will be able to comply with the terms of a particular
obligation,''
 and cited one rating organization's designation as a ``current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor
with respect to a specific debt obligation.''
 The release went on to state that a debt rating was ``an evaluation of the likelihood that an issuer will be able to make
timely interest payments and will be able to repay principal,'' and a preferred stock rating was an ``assess[ment]
of the relative security of dividend payments.''
 







In adopting a policy of voluntary ratings disclosure, the Commission noted that the state of affairs at the time did
not show a ``pressing need'' for mandatory disclosure.
 Underlying the Commission's action was an understanding that the market viewed debt securities and preferred stock
with the same rating designation and comparable payment terms as fungible. 





The importance of security ratings continues today. Ratings influence a company's cost of capital. Investment bankers
and issuers often solicit the rating organizations' views when developing new financial instruments or structuring
financing transactions. Investors typically use ratings for various reasons such as establishing internal investment
guidelines and considering alternative investments. Because of changes in the securities market the Commission
has determined to reconsider its policy of voluntary ratings disclosure. 


B. Growth of Customized, Structured, and Derivative Securities 



Since adoption of the Commission's policy on security ratings, there has been a dramatic proliferation in the types
of securities offered in the marketplace, with the development of a vast market for mortgage and asset backed securities
and other highly structured or derivative financial instruments. The rights and obligations evidenced by these
financial instruments typically differ significantly from the traditional fixed obligations, evidenced by corporate
debt and preferred stock, to pay sums certain in the form of interest and principal or dividends at set intervals. Moreover,
in addition to the change in the types of securities being rated, the scope and meaning of ratings themselves have become
more variable. Disclosure concerning ratings, however, has remained largely static. 



1. Evolution of Financial Instruments 



Unlike the traditional debt and preferred stock instruments upon which the 1981 policy was based, today many securities
with the same rating are not viewed by the market as generic and fungible. An investor's investment return and the issuer's
payment obligations evidenced by these instruments often are contingent on, and highly sensitive to, changes in
the values of underlying assets, indices, interest rates and cash flows. Risks relating to fluctuations in interest
rates and other economic and market factors may be as important to an instrument's investment return as the issuer's
creditworthiness. Because of these non-credit payment risks, there is substantially greater uncertainty relating
to yield and total return than for traditional debt obligations of comparable credit rating. Moreover, the terms
of these financial instruments are highly complex and frequently are individually tailored to specific investor
demands. In short, today's instruments run along a spectrum from a fixed obligation to pay sums certain to a highly
contingent residual interest in variable future cash flows. 

For example, structured notes offer an infinite variety of payment obligations and present substantial cash flow,
market, and liquidity risks in addition to credit risk.
 To illustrate, a structured note may promise a specified interest payment monthly for two years, but principal payable
at maturity may be determined by reference to the number of days an interest index exceeds a benchmark rate, subject
to a cap. If the index never exceeds the benchmark rate during the measurement period, by the instrument's terms, the
investor receives the minimum principal amount (which often is less than face or stated value). Such note could be
assigned a ``triple-a'' rating under a credit analysis if issued by a highly-capitalized, financially sound company.
The credit rating would address the likelihood that the issuer will be able to pay any principal due, not the likelihood
that the investor will receive any principal payment. 





Likewise, from the relatively simple mortgage-backed obligations (single-class securities representing equal,
undivided interests in a pool of mortgages) that were developed in the 1970s, mortgage-backed and asset-backed pooled
securities have evolved through financial engineering into highly customized instruments with unlimited potential
variations. While credit risk remains important to investors in mortgage-backed securities, additional investment
considerations are introduced by uncertain principal prepayment speeds associated with the underlying interest
rate sensitive assets. 

Simple mortgage-backed securities may include multiple senior-subordinated class structures, with the subordinated
classes bearing a disproportionate share of the credit risk, but all classes sharing prepayment risk equally. With
more complex, customized collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs''), the cash flows (i.e., the stream of payments
on the underlying mortgage loans) are ``carved up'' into a multi-class bond structure so that the prepayment risk
is disproportionately allocated to certain classes. Each class receives interest and/or principal payments based
on the priorities in the payment structure. For example, a ``planned amortization class'' (``PAC'') is designed
to produce more stable cash flows by redirecting prepayments on the underlying pooled assets to other classes called
``companion classes,'' which act as ``shock absorbers'' for the PAC with respect to prepayments. Both the PAC and
the companion classes could be senior securities, and rank ``pari passu'' with respect to credit defaults on the underlying
loans and both could be rated ``triple a,'' notwithstanding the disproportionate share of prepayment risk borne
by the companion classes, a risk not addressed by a traditional credit rating.

``Residual'' securities, typically representing a beneficial interest in whatever cash flows remain in the pool
of financial assets after obligations to pay all other outstanding classes have been satisfied, have been rated.
In a number of cases, because of the highly speculative nature of these cash flows, the residual has incorporated a
fixed promise to pay a nominal amount, e.g., $10,000 principal in the early months of the security's existence, to
the residual holder. The amount of the fixed nominal obligation may have no relationship to the amount paid for the
residual, nor to the anticipated residual cash flow. The credit rating for the residual represents only an evaluation
of the likelihood that the holder will receive the promised nominal amount. Thus, a residual could be rated ``triple-a''
even if there are other securities in the offering that are not. 


2. Non-Credit Payment Evaluations 


In response to developments of derivative and structured securities that have significant non-credit risks, rating
organizations are developing analytical models to evaluate the non-credit risks of these instruments. For example,
one rating organization has developed a ``volatility'' rating (``V-Rating''), scaled V1-V5, intended to
provide an indication of the volatility (or, conversely, predictability) of a security in total return, price, and
cash flow over a range or various interest rate scenarios.

23

 The volatility of ``current coupon agency certificates''

24

 is used as a benchmark. Classes assigned ratings of V1, V2, and V3 demonstrate volatility less than or equal to current
coupon agency certificates over the range of interest rate scenarios. Classes assigned ratings of V4 and V5 demonstrate
greater volatility over the range of interest rate scenarios than do current coupon agency certificates.

25

 






Another rating organization has adopted the practice of attaching a symbol_the letter ``r''_to its traditional
credit rating for certain derivative securities to alert investors that the instruments may experience high volatility
or dramatic fluctuations in their expected returns because of market risk.

26

 The principal function of the ``r'' symbol is to serve as an investor alert. It does not provide a measure or quantification
of the non-credit payment risk (although the rating organization continues in its efforts to develop market-risk
measures which might quantify non-credit payment risk).

27

 The rating organization notes, however, that ``[t]he absence of an ``r'' symbol should not be taken as an indication
that an obligation will exhibit no volatility or variability in total return.''

28








A new rating permutation has evolved in response to the creation of cash flow securities, also known as ``kitchen-sink''
bonds.

29

 A cash flow security represents an interest in a pool of several classes of previously issued unrelated mortgage backed
securities, which typically are highly sensitive to principal prepayment speed and have volatile yields. Because
each underlying security may have been issued at different times, be backed by different pools of mortgage loans,
have different allocations of principal and interest among the various classes, and perform differently in various
interest rate and prepayment rate environments, the performance of the cash flow security will reflect a combination
of the performance characteristics of the various underlying securities. In registered cash flow bond offerings
seen to date, where the aggregate stated principal amounts of the underlying pooled securities was less than the stated
principal balance of the cash flow securities, the cash flow securities would not qualify for a ``triple a'' credit
rating with respect to principal repayment. 




Two rating organizations separately have developed and applied a methodology to analyze the likelihood of receipt
of a specified amount of cash flow (combined interest and principal payments on the underlying assets) from the pooled
securities, without regard to whether such payment amount constitutes interest or principal repayment.

30

 Assessing the likelihood of receipt of this cash flow combines both a credit rating and non-credit payment evaluation
of prepayments on the underlying pooled securities. Applying prepayment analysis to determine the likelihood of
receipt of aggregate cash flows represents a significant development in rating techniques. 




The cash flow ratings do not address the likelihood of receipt of the original principal amount of the cash flow security
or the receipt of any specified amount of interest; the rating assesses the likelihood of receiving a specified dollar
amount of cash over the life of the security. Because the cash flow rating does not address the marketed or expected
promises, a cash flow rating may be viewed as a limited scope rating in that it does not rate the likelihood of payment
in accordance with the instrument's actual or expected terms. 
Initially, cash flow ratings were assigned the same rating designations as assigned for traditional credit ratings.
One rating organization has appended, and the other has expressed a willingness to append, a suffix to rating designations
for cash flow securities.

3. Security Ratings Disclosure Practices 


Notwithstanding these developments, little has changed with respect to most ratings disclosures and regulatory
policies using such ratings. Today, a traditional corporate debt instrument with fixed principal and interest obligations,
a structured note whose principal or interest is tied, for example to an index of securities, an ``interest-only''
strip (``IO''), a collateralized mortgage obligation (``CMO'') security, a residual interest in a CMO offering,
and a cash flow (or ``kitchen-sink'') bond all can be designated ``triple-a,'' notwithstanding that investment
returns on most of these instruments are largely dependent on factors in addition to the issuer's creditworthiness
and that the scope of the rating differs among the securities. Moreover, despite the differences among these securities,
issuers, financial intermediaries, and investors have availed themselves of the regulatory accommodations provided
for securities rated investment grade by NRSROs.

31







II. Proposals 


A. General 


The growth of customized asset-backed, derivative, and structured securities that have significant non-credit
payment risks, as well as the development of ``limited scope'' ratings,

32

 have caused the Commission to reconsider its voluntary ratings disclosure policy. When these complex, customized
securities first developed, they were purchased by a relatively small number of large, highly sophisticated institutional
investors. Recent evidence suggests that these securities are increasingly being offered and sold to a larger investor
base, either directly or through mutual funds and pension plans.

33








Current rating designations and the variation in meaning and scope of the ratings represented, together with the
widely disparate payment obligations of the securities rated, have a substantial potential to confuse, and in some
cases mislead, investors. This problem is exacerbated in secondary market transactions where no disclosure document
may be delivered and ratings are described simply by shorthand reference to the rating letter designation. Even where
there is a delivered disclosure document, it is often difficult to understand clearly the scope of the rating. Likewise,
many market participants have assumed that the same regulatory treatment should apply to similarly rated securities,
notwithstanding significant differences in the nature of the payment obligations, the significant non-credit
payment risk exposure for many of today's securities, and the limited scope of some security ratings. Given the extensive
use of, and reliance on, ratings, and the wide disparity in the meaning and significance of the rating, the Commission
today is proposing a mandatory ratings disclosure scheme. 


B. Mandated Disclosures 


Today's proposals would replace the current voluntary ratings disclosure policy with a system requiring disclosure
in a final prospectus of a rating given by an NRSRO whenever a rating with respect to the securities being offered is
obtained by or on behalf of an issuer. Material changes in ratings would be required to be reported on Form 8-K
under the Exchange Act. The new disclosure requirements are intended to enhance security rating disclosures so that
investors clearly understand what terms of a security are being rated and the limitations, if any, on the rating, and
are advised on a current basis of material rating changes. In particular, the proposed disclosure would highlight
whether the assigned rating covers timely payment of all obligations or whether it is limited in its scope, and whether
there are significant non-credit payment risks not addressed by the rating. 


1. Mandated Prospectus Disclosure 


Under the proposal, when a security rating is obtained by or on behalf of an issuer from an NRSRO (a ``solicited rating''),
the issuer would be required to disclose in the final prospectus

34

 the rating assigned and a discussion of the scope of the rating.

35

 The issuer would be required to keep the prospectus disclosure of ratings current so long as the offering continued.

36

 The mandated disclosure also would apply when any rating (whether or not assigned by an NRSRO) is used in connection
with the offer or sale of a security by any participant in the offering.

37

 Commenters are requested to address the proposed treatment of ratings used by any participant in the offering, particularly
in view of the need to provide a consent of the rating organization if it is not an NRSRO. 







As proposed, the rule would require disclosure of ``obtained'' NRSRO ratings, whether or not the issuer (or a participant
in the offering) chooses to use the rating in the selling effort. Commenters should address whether this requirement
could lead to attempts to thwart the mandated disclosure merely by non-substantive or procedural modification to
the practice of assigning ratings so that, for example, an issuer would not view a security rating as ``obtained by
or on behalf of the issuer'' unless agreed to by the issuer. Of course, such attempts would raise substantial antifraud
issues. If this outcome is possible, should the disclosure obligation be keyed off another event such as when an NRSRO
provides the issuer with a ``preliminary'' indication of what the rating would be? Should the rule mandate disclosure
only when the NRSRO rating is used in the offering? Would this result in use and therefore disclosure of favorable ratings,
and non-use and non-disclosure of unfavorable ratings? Where no NRSRO rating is provided in the prospectus, should
the rule require disclosure that the securities have not been rated by an NRSRO, a discussion of whether there were
any contacts with an NRSRO about rating the securities, and a summary description of the contacts which would include
any actions taken by the NRSRO, and any views expressed by the NRSRO? Commenters also should address the extent to which
practices to avoid disclosure of unfavorable ratings are likely to occur.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-1-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For purposes of the proposed rules, a ``security rating'' is defined as a credit assessment of an issuer's ability
to make payments of principal, interest, dividends (as applicable), or other payments on the instrument being rated.

38

 The proposed rules also would require disclosure of any designation assigned in connection with a rating organization's
evaluation of the security's non-credit payment risks. For example, the evaluations covered by such designation
would include an organization's analysis of prepayment speeds, effects of interest rates or other market based factors,
event risk provisions, or volatility assessments done in connection with or in addition to a solicited rating.

39

 Comment is requested whether all these evaluations should be required to be disclosed and whether any or all these
evaluations should be required to be disclosed even if issued in the absence of a solicited security rating.

40

 






The proposed rules do not mandate, but would continue to permit, disclosure of ratings by rating organizations that
are not designated NRSROs. However, the mandated disclosure proposals would extend to ratings assigned by non-NRSROs
that are used voluntarily in the prospectus. Comment is requested, however, as to whether disclosure should be required
when a non-NRSRO rating is used to market the securities. Historically, the consent requirement has, for the most
part, foreclosed disclosure of such ratings. Disclosure of such ratings in the prospectus would continue to require
the rating organization to consent to be named in the registration statement as an expert, and thereby assume potential
Section 11 liability under the Securities Act.

41

 





The Commission solicits comment on the continued appropriateness of its policy of exempting NRSROs from providing
consents, while other rating organizations are required to provide consents for their ratings to be disclosed in
prospectuses and registration statements. Would the proposed disclosure requirements cause issuers to forgo ratings
or seek ratings from non-NRSROs? Should the Commission expand the consent exemption to all ratings organizations?
Would this result in ratings being issued by unqualified parties and the potential for investors to be misled? If the
exemption were extended to all rating organizations, should the proposed rule mandate disclosure with respect to
all ratings obtained by or on behalf of a registrant, whether or not issued by an NRSRO? 

On the other hand, should the exemption be rescinded for NRSROs? If the exemption were rescinded, and rating disclosure
were mandated, what would be the effect on the practice of rating securities? Would issuers forgo obtaining ratings?
Should the exemption be rescinded even if the Commission were to determine to continue its voluntary disclosure policy?
Would this cause issuers to eliminate ratings disclosure in prospectuses and registration statements? If so, would
ratings disclosure be eliminated entirely for registered public offerings or disseminated outside the prospectus
and registration statement? 

As proposed, the rules would not require disclosure of unsolicited ratings_ratings issued by a rating organization
on securities on its own initiative, not at the request of the company and not used by any participant in the offering.
Where the company does not have any involvement with the rating, and does not use or permit the use of a rating in an offering,
it would appear unwarranted for it to have to assume disclosure responsibility and liability for such ratings. On
the other hand, the ability to disclose a favorable solicited rating and not disclose a lower unsolicited rating arguably
could encourage rating shopping and could allow companies to avoid disclosure that there are disagreements about
the creditworthiness of a particular security. Should issuers be required to disclose unsolicited ratings by NRSROs
if materially different from that disclosed? If so, to what extent should issuers be responsible for ascertaining
whether an unsolicited rating has been issued? If such unsolicited ratings are required to be disclosed, should the
mandated disclosure be limited to the rating assigned and name of the issuing rating organization? Would mandated
disclosure of unsolicited ratings in effect compel issuers to obtain ratings from all NRSROs to protect against having
to disclose unsolicited ratings that may be based on incomplete information? 

The Commission also solicits comment on the need to require disclosure in the prospectus on the method of compensating
the rating organization. Likewise, comment is requested as to whether the extent of the rating organization involvement
in the structuring of the security should be disclosed. 

Closed-end investment companies (``closed-end funds'') often issue senior securities that are rated by one or more
NRSROs. As with non-investment companies, closed-end funds are not required to disclose these ratings in their prospectuses.
Form N-2,

42

 the form used by closed-end investment companies to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940

43

 and to register their securities under the Securities Act, sets forth the disclosure requirements for ratings when
the rating is included in a closed-end fund prospectus.

44

 Comment is requested whether the mandatory disclosure approach being proposed today also should be applied to closed-end
funds and other investment companies. 







2. Disclosure Required with Respect to Security Ratings 



Regulations S-K and S-B are proposed to be amended to specify the disclosure required whenever a security
rating is disclosed, either voluntarily or pursuant to Commission rule. The ratings disclosure should tie directly
to the description of securities so that potential investors may compare the actual payment obligations, expected
payments, and risks with the promises and risks assessed by the assigning rating organization. The proposed rules
require description of: (1) What elements of the securities the rating addresses; (2) all material limitations or
qualifications on the rating; (3) any related designation (or other published evaluation) of non-credit payment
risks assigned by the rating organization with respect to the security; and (4) any material differences between
the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the minimum obligations of the security as specified
in the governing instruments or, if significantly different, the terms as marketed to investors. For example, the
rating description should explain if the security was rated using a yield assumption which differs from the expected
yield being marketed to investors. Also, by way of example, a statement that the rating ``covers payment obligations
in accordance with the terms of the security'' usually would not be informative where the security permits the issuer
to defer interest payments for a specified time period. In this instance, the ratings discussion should explain whether
the rating assumes that the interest deferral provision is or is not exercised. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-1-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The issuer would disclose the required information for each solicited rating. If the rating designation includes
a reference to a designation or published evaluation of non-credit payment risk (e.g., sensitivity to movements
in interest rates), the additional analysis should be described. Where related evaluations are done, any use of the
rating designation should include the designation for the related non-credit payment evaluation so investors relying
on the designation are not left unaware of the related evaluation. For example, where a cash flow security is evaluated
both for likelihood of cash receipt and susceptibility to interest rate volatility, the designation always should
be presented in combination. 

Not infrequently, the problem in clearly understanding the scope and meaning of the rating of structured instruments
is exacerbated by the complexity and lack of clarity in the description of the securities being offered.

45

 In some cases, even the title of the securities could lead to investor misunderstanding of the nature of the securities.
The description of the securities should make clear the extent to which payment obligations are fixed or contingent,
clearly explaining the nature of the contingencies. 





In many cases, securities are offered on the basis of expected returns that can vary from the issuer's contractual
commitments. For example, the terms of some asset-backed securities obligate the issuer only to pay available funds
passed through from the underlying assets, but investors may expect a minimum stated return and, in fact, the security
may be marketed as providing a stated return. In such cases, care needs to be used in both primary and secondary transaction
disclosures to ensure that investors understand the limited obligation of the issuer. 

Comment is requested on the adequacy of the proposed disclosure requirements and whether the proposed requirements
would assure that investors will be able to understand the limitations associated with a rating and will be able to
compare ratings. Commenters suggesting alternative items should be specific in their suggestions. Commenters
also should suggest approaches to ensure that the description of securities is clear and complete, and to ensure that
security titles convey the risks involved in an investment. 

Comment also is requested as to whether issuers should be required to disclose activities that could be viewed as ``rating
shopping''_that is approaching a number of rating organizations to determine which organization will provide the
highest rating on security terms most favorable to the issuer. To what extent does this practice occur and warrant
such disclosure? Should the rules require issuers to disclose contacts with any NRSRO with respect to rating the securities
being registered? If such disclosure is favored, should it only be required if the issuer discloses a rating in its
prospectus? Alternatively, should such contacts be reported even if no rating is disclosed or required to be disclosed
in the prospectus? If disclosure of preliminary contacts with NRSROs is required, what effect will such disclosures
have on rating practices? 

Mutual funds often represent that they invest only in securities that have a specified rating, such as investment
grade, or disclose the percentage of their portfolios comprised of securities with specified ratings. As discussed
above, a rating may not convey a security's level of market risk, and, in the absence of appropriate disclosure, investors
may not perceive the limitations of a rating or the investment characteristics it addresses. Comment is requested
whether current mutual fund disclosure practices and requirements adequately address the limitations and scope
of ratings and how mutual fund disclosure documents could be improved to improve investor understanding of the limitations
of ratings. 



3. Rating Designations 



As discussed above, rating organizations frequently have used the same rating designations to represent their evaluation
of a wide range of instruments with disparate types of payment obligations and, in many cases, subject to substantial
market, cash flow, and liquidity risks. In some cases, the same designation has been used to represent limited scope
ratings such as those involving cash flow securities and residuals. Recently, some NRSROs, when rating various interest
rate sensitive instruments, have begun to use modifying designations to indicate the existence of non-credit payment
risk but not a judgment of the extent of this risk. 

Given the market's widespread use of ratings, and the common use of simple letter designations as shorthand communications
of the rating, there is a substantial potential for investor misunderstanding. This problem can be particularly
acute in the secondary markets. 

Comment is requested as to the potential for investors to be confused or misled about the nature of the security or the
meaning of a rating as the result of current rating designation practices. Should the disclosure of ratings require
the use of designations that clearly distinguish traditional credit ratings from cash flow, residual or other limited
scope ratings? Should ratings of securities subject to substantial non-credit related payment risks continue to
be designated the same as securities that do not carry such risks? To the extent that commentators believe that there
is a significant likelihood that investors may be misled through rating designations, should the Commission rely
on rating organizations' self regulation to address the problem, or should the Commission take regulatory action
to assure that a rating organization's designation system avoids issuing the same rating designation to securities
having substantially different credit or other non-credit payment risks? 



4. Security Rating Changes 



The Commission is proposing to require issuers to report material changes in security ratings of their securities
on Form 8-K. Not only is such information of importance to a company's security holders, but, as noted in the Commission's
recent release on municipal disclosures, timely disclosure of such rating action is important to the efficiency
and transparency of the debt markets.

46

 





Under the proposal, issuers would be required to file a Form 8-K report within 15 calendar days of having been
advised by the rating organization of a material change in any NRSRO rating obtained for its securities, including
commercial paper, or any other rating of its securities that has been previously disclosed in a prospectus or registration
statement for such securities registered under the Securities Act. As proposed, the disclosure of the changed rating
would be accompanied by the same disclosure specified in Item 202(g) of Regulation S-K.

47

 





Comment is requested as to whether the Commission's proposal to mandate disclosure of material ratings upgrades
is appropriate. Under the proposal, it is contemplated that reporting of all adverse rating changes would be required.
The Commission requests comment as to whether there are rating downgrades that commenters believe should be viewed
as immaterial. In particular, are there classes of securities as to which information on downgrades would not be material
to a company's shareholders or debtholders? 

Comment also is requested as to the appropriateness of the 15 day calendar period for reporting the rating change.
Should the period be shorter, e.g. 5 business days, or longer, e.g. 20 days? Should the period run from the date of the
rating change, rather than the date of notice of the change to the issuer? Should rating changes be reportable on a quarterly
basis on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K (for the fourth quarter) rather than Form 8-K? 

Commenters also should address the extent of the proposed disclosure matters. Should the proposed disclosure be
streamlined to require only reporting: the NRSRO or other rating organization taking the action; the title of the
securities affected; and both the prior and the new ratings? Comment also is requested as to whether the proposed disclosure
requirement should be triggered when there is a change in a rating disclosed in any filing with the Commission (e.g.,
annual report on Form 10-K). 



III. Request for Comment 



Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the proposals, as well as any other matters that might
have an impact on the proposals set forth in the release are requested to do so. The Commission requests comments on
the impact of the proposals on issuers, potential investors, security holders, broker-dealers, rating organizations,
and others. Comments also are requested on whether the proposed rule would have an adverse effect on competition that
is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Commission
will consider comments in complying with its responsibilities under Section 19(a) of the Securities Act

48

 and Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

49

 






IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



Assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposals, commenters are
requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and benefits associated with these proposals. The proposals
are expected to increase to some extent the net costs to issuers associated with registering securities for sale and
complying with reporting requirements; these costs could be significant if the exemption for NRSROs from the consent
requirements under the Securities Act were rescinded and the disclosure of ratings were mandatory. The costs to investors
associated with these proposals are minimal. The proposals are expected to provide additional benefits to investors
by enlarging the mix of information available to investors regarding security ratings and by alleviating the potential
for market misunderstanding. Currently, many issuers seek security ratings for their securities in order to make
them marketable. Because the proposals would require disclosure of security ratings and do not address whether issuers
should obtain security ratings, the proposals are not expected to affect the issuance of rated securities, assuming
the exemption for NRSROs from the consent requirements under the Securities Act is retained. 



V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 for the proposed amendments.
The analysis notes that the proposals are expected to increase regulatory costs for small entities which offer securities
registered under the Securities Act.

</DOC>

<DOCNO> FR940907-1-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes may affect persons that are small entities, as defined
by the Commission's rules. While it may be unlikely that small entities will publicly sell rated securities (because
of the costs of obtaining a rating and because of the exemptions from registration available), any such small entity
would be required to prepare additional disclosure regarding certain ratings assigned to the small entity's securities.
While this would increase the compliance burdens of small entities, the analysis notes that no other significant
alternative would achieve the Commission's objective of reducing the potential for market confusion about the scope
and meaning of security ratings. 

Commenters are urged to comment on any aspect of the analysis. All comments will be available publicly. Any comments
will be considered in preparing the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposals are adopted. For a copy
of the analysis, contact Brian P. Miller, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission,

 (Item 202) Description of Securities. 



* * * * * 



(d) 

Security Ratings. 

(1)(i) If a registrant has obtained a security rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
(``NRSRO'') with respect to a class of securities being registered under the Securities Act or any rating (whether
or not assigned by an NRSRO) is used in the offer or sale of the securities by any participant in an offering, the registrant
shall include in the forepart of the prospectus the information required by this paragraph (d) for each such rating
obtained or used. 

(ii) If a registrant voluntarily discloses any security rating assigned by a rating organization other than an NRSRO
in a prospectus or registration statement under the Securities Act, the registrant shall include in the prospectus
the information required by this paragraph (d). 

(iii) If a registrant is required to disclose a change in a security rating pursuant to Item 9 of Form 8-K (17 CFR
249.308), the registrant shall disclose the information required by this paragraph (d) to the extent not disclosed
previously, or to the extent different. 

(2) Whenever a registrant discloses a security rating pursuant to this paragraph (d), the registrant shall disclose
the following for each security rating disclosed: 

(i) The identity of the rating organization assigning the rating; 

(ii) The rating assigned; 

(iii) The relative rank of the rating within the assigning rating organization's overall classification system;


(iv) A description of what the rating addresses; 

(v) All material scope limitations of the rating; 

(vi) Any material differences between the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the terms of

(vii) Any material differences in the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the terms of the security
as marketed to investors; 
(viii) A statement informing investors that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities,
that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating; and 
(ix) Any published designation reflecting the results of any other evaluation done by the rating organization in
connection with the rating, along with an explanation of the designation's meaning and the relative rank of the designation.



Instructions to Item 202 



1. For purposes of paragraph (d), the term nationally recognized statistical rating organization

 shall have the same meaning as used in  240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) of this chapter. 

2. A registrant shall disclose any material limitations to the security rating on the outside front cover page of the
prospectus. 

3. If a registrant includes information about security ratings in a prospectus pursuant to paragraph (d), the registrant
shall update the description of each rating as set forth in this instruction 3: 

A. If a change in a rating already included in the prospectus is available subsequent to the filing of the registration
statement, but prior to its effectiveness, the registrant shall include such rating change in the final prospectus.
If the rating change is material, or if the registrant is required to disclose a materially different rating from any
disclosed rating which becomes available during this period, the registrant shall amend the registration statement
to include the rating change or the additional rating and should consider recirculating the preliminary prospectus.


B. If an additional rating that the registrant is required to disclose, or if a material change in a rating already included,
becomes available during any period in which offers or sales are being made, the registrant shall disclose such additional
rating or rating change by means of a post-effective amendment, or sticker to the prospectus pursuant to  230.424(b)
of this chapter. However, a post-effective amendment or sticker is not required in the case of a registration statement
on Form S-3 ( 239.13 of this chapter) if the registrant timely discloses the additional rating or the rating
change in a document incorporated by reference into the registration statement subsequent to its effectiveness

Instructions to Item 202.


* * * * * 


6. For purposes of paragraph (g), the term nationally recognized statistical rating organization 

shall have the same meaning as used in  240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F). 
7. A registrant shall disclose any material limitations to the security rating on the outside front cover page of the
prospectus. 
8. If a registrant includes information about security ratings in a prospectus pursuant to paragraph (g), the registrant
shall update the description of each rating as set forth in this instruction 8: 
A. If a change in a rating already included in the prospectus is available subsequent to the filing of the registration
statement, but prior to its effectiveness, the registrant shall include such rating change in the final prospectus.
If the rating change is material, or if the registrant is required to disclose a materially different rating from any
disclosed rating which becomes available during this period, the registrant shall amend the registration statement
to include the rating change or the additional rating and should consider recirculating the preliminary prospectus.

B. If an additional rating that the registrant is required to disclose, or if a material change in a rating already included,
becomes available during any period in which offers or sales are being made, the registrant shall disclose such additional
rating or rating change by means of a post-effective amendment, or sticker to the prospectus pursuant to  230.424(b)
of this chapter. However, a post-effective amendment or sticker is not required in the case of a registration statement
on Form S-3 ( 239.13 of this chapter) if the registrant timely discloses the additional rating or the rating
change in a document incorporated by reference into the registration statement subsequent to its effectiveness
and prior to termination of the offering. 
9. If a registrant discloses a security rating assigned by a non-NRSRO, the registrant also should include the written
consent of the non-NRSRO rating organization. With respect to the written consent of any NRSRO, see  230.436(g)
of this chapter. When the registrant has filed a registration statement on Form F-9 ( 239.39 of this chapter),
see  230.436(g) of this chapter with respect to the written consent of any rating organization specified in
the Instruction to paragraph (A)(2) of General Instruction I of Form F-9.
