West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed program for financial assistance. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes a program, the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan (NEAP), that would provide $12 million of assistance
to salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest who have been affected by a fishery resource disaster during 1992 through
1994, while providing conservation benefits to salmon resources. NMFS proposes that these disaster relief funds,
which were made available under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), be applied toward the following three
programs, administered by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program_Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife; and a habitat restoration program_Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), and a data collection program_Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), both of
which would provide jobs to commercial salmon fishermen. The intent is to provide assistance to those fishermen who
have recently participated in the salmon fisheries, who were substantially reliant on West Coast salmon resources
for their income, and who suffered an uninsured loss as a result of a significant reduction in income because of the
resource disaster. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


On May 26, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) declared a fishery disaster and, with the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), announced a $15.7 million emergency aid package for Oregon, Washington, and northern California.
This aid is intended to alleviate the economic hardship imposed on individuals and communities by the collapse of
salmon stocks in fishing areas along the Northwest coast. Included in this package is $12 million of aid that was made
available, under the Secretary's declaration that a fishery resource disaster exists under section 308(d) of the
Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), to undertake the NEAP program as described in this
notice. 
In addition, $3 million is being administered by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of USDA. Grants by RDA
will be made to public bodies and private nonprofit corporations to finance development of small business enterprises
in cities under 50,000 in population. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce
is making $882,000 available, instead of the $700,000 originally announced as part of the $15.7 million aid package.
Grants by EDA have been earmarked to communities for tourism development and to tribes for stream reclamation. 
In addition to the $15.7 million package, aid to salmon fishermen is also being provided by the Small Business Administration
(SBA) and the Farmers Home Administration, in the form of loans and debt restructuring programs, and by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the form of unemployment assistance, up to
$14 million, to dislocated Washington and Oregon fishermen who are unemployed as a direct result of the continuing
effects of El Ni&ntilde;o on salmon fishing. A request for such aid for California fishermen is under review. 
On behalf of the Secretary, NMFS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28838),
to solicit public comment on issues to be considered in development and implementation of the $12 million NEAP program.
The comment period, as modified on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35674), closed July 15, 1994; comments received are responded
to in this notice. At the time the ANPR was prepared, NMFS anticipated implementing the assistance program through
rulemaking. However, because codification of the program is unnecessary to comply with statutory requirements,
implementation will be achieved through procedures proposed in this notice. Following consideration of all comments
received, NMFS will publish a notice of the final NEAP program in the 

Federal Register

. 
In addition to the ANPR, NOAA's Office of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs (SDI) arranged
a series of eight town meetings designed to gather information about the effects of the decline in the salmon resources
on local communities and fishermen. Meetings were held between June 1 and June 10, 1994, in Fort Bragg and Crescent
City, CA; Coos Bay, Newport, Portland, and Astoria, OR; and Port Angeles and Westport, WA. More than 700 people attended
the meetings and provided more than 37 hours of testimony. 
The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comment on the limitations, terms, and conditions that the Secretary
has determined are necessary to administer the program, within the conditions in section 308(d) of the IFA.

Fishery Resource Disaster 


Although West Coast (Washington, Oregon, and California) salmon stocks experience annual fluctuations in abundance,
stock abundances in the last few years have been exceptionally low. West Coast salmon species are coho, chinook, chum,
sockeye, and pink salmon. Landings of chinook and coho, have declined significantly, from roughly 6.2 million fish
in 1988 to 2 million fish in 1993. Additional information regarding the declines in chinook and coho can be found in
the ANPR and is not repeated here. 
Chinook salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off Washington and Oregon north of Cape Falcon were closed in 1994 by the
Federal Government. Other salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off central and southern Oregon and northern California
are at reduced levels and are closed to fishing for coho. It is predicted that 1994 ocean salmon landings, coastwide,
will amount to only 289,000 chinook and zero coho. The fishing seasons for inside fisheries are the most restrictive
ever imposed in many areas. Recent estimates of the 1994 ocean chinook and coho fisheries, compared to 1993 catches,
indicate that, for the two species combined, cumulative catches through July are down 95 percent in Washington; down
76 percent in Oregon; and up 19 percent in California. California catches reflect increased availability of salmon
off southern and central California, south of Point Arena. In general, California catches are significantly below
1988-89 catch levels, when environmental conditions were more favorable. Harvests of salmon off northern
California have been extremely limited_commercial salmon fisheries are generally closed in this area for 1994,
except for post-peak season openings in September. 
Despite increasingly stringent management measures enacted in recent years to protect these salmon stocks, they
have reached a critical stage of depletion, due in part to environmental conditions unfavorable to salmon survival
that include: (1) An extended drought in California, in combination with the already depressed condition of northern
California stocks; (2) less than normal snowpack throughout the western United States; (3) drought followed by extensive
flooding in the State of Washington; and (4) poor upwelling, due to an extreme El Ni&ntilde;o ocean warming event during
1992-1993, all of which are believed to have been responsible for extremely poor salmon survival. 


Comments and Responses 


Comments on the ANPR were received from 27 entities. Many of the comments described the hardships the salmon disaster
has caused to individuals, Indian tribes, and communities. Several commenters stated that the proposed funds are
inadequate. Several also expressed appreciation for the Department of Commerce's efforts. In addition, SDI received
59 letters from affected parties, mainly as a result of the series of town meetings held to get public input on ways to
address the disaster. Correspondents included fishermen, trade associations, nonprofit organizations, state
and local government officials and agencies (including the Governors of Oregon and Washington), and members of Congress.

The ANPR requested comments on six specific questions. The following comments were received in response to those
questions. 
1. What would be appropriate goals of the program? How might salmon abundance be increased through this program? 


Comments

: An Indian tribe, two individual members of another tribe, and a charterboat operator indicated that the goal should
be complete restoration of salmon stocks. The two tribe members suggested coordinating emergency mandates to achieve
this goal. The Indian tribe stated that loss of the salmon fishery cannot be mitigated by awarding money, and the individual
noted that financial aid to commercial fishermen will not increase salmon numbers. 
Another individual said that the program should destroy or modify dams to ensure salmon passage. 


Response

: The goal of the proposed program is to compensate individual fishermen for their uninsured losses, while also protecting
the long-term viability of the fishery resources. 
2. What should be additional eligibility criteria, within statutory constraints, to receive a grant? 


Comments

: A coastal zone management association and a state senator said that grants should go to individuals actively engaged
in the commercial salmon fishery (ocean troll, ocean charterboat, and lower Columbia River gillnet). A separate
allocation should be made to each state, based only on commercial economic data reflecting the relative economic
declines, e.g., base years of 1986-90 compared with El Ni&ntilde;o years of 
1991-93. Non-charterboat recreational data should not be included. 
The Pacific Fisheries Legislative Task Force commented that the maximum grant amount should be $15,000, not $100,000,
to help more people; the $2 million ceiling for the past year's income, as contained in the IFA, is unrealistic; and,
making fishermen eligible for unemployment compensation would be helpful. 
One fisherman stated that aid should go to dislocated fishermen first, and not to related businesses. Criteria should
include being a participant in the Lower 48 salmon fishery for 50 percent or more of income, with priority given to those
who do not have an alternate fishery to fall back on, and those who need to update safety equipment. 
Another fisherman suggested a buyout of $60,000 for current permit holders that have been active for the last 10 years,
and a buyout of $20,000 for nonactive permit holders, defined as those who have not sold salmon within the last 3 years.
Deckhands who can document work on a salmon troller within the last 3 years should receive a cash grant of $7,000. In
addition, there should be a moratorium on fishing for 3 years, in exchange for a $25,000 grant per year. 
A charterboat operator stated that criteria need to be consistent coastwide and that, to be eligible, fishermen should
have at least 25 percent (up to 50 percent) of income averaged over the last 5 years from salmon fishing. Also, salmon
landing databases should be used to determine eligibility; meaningful levels of assistance should be provided to
displaced ocean salmon fishermen prior to aid to inland participants; grants should be a minimum of $5,000; and qualification
criteria should be generated by those directly involved in salmon fishing. 
A boat puller stated that boat pullers/boat hands should receive consideration for aid. 
One Indian tribe wrote to request that NMFS compensate each member of the tribe for the loss of the fishery. 
A businessman (non-fisherman) commented that owners of failed troller operations should not receive preference
over owners of other small businesses that have failed due to the salmon disaster. 
A county economic development council commented that local government agencies should be eligible for assistance.

Three Indian tribes commented that tribal governments should be eligible for grants under the program. 
An individual stated that aid should go only to those in commercial fishing for at least 10 consecutive years. Associations
should not be eligible for awards, to prevent fishermen who are association members from getting double benefits.

A tribal individual recommended eligibility for tribal members of one of the four treaty tribes along the Columbia
River and its tributaries.

Response:

 NMFS is proposing the following eligibility criteria: Participation in the commercial fishery in either 1992 or
1993; at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery in the base year, selected from 1986-1989,
used to determine a loss; at least a 50 percent decline in commercial fishery income from the base year as compared to
commercial fishery income in 1992 or 1993, whichever is greater; and, if single, 1993 gross income of less than $25,000,
or if married, combined gross income of less than $50,000. Persons receiving a permit buyout would not be eligible
for the jobs programs. The disaster relief funds are being made available under the IFA, which excludes government
entities from receiving aid; tribal and local governments are ineligible for this program. However, individual
tribal commercial fishermen are eligible to apply for the NEAP program. 
3. If fishing permits are relinquished, how can their further reissuance be handled by the states? 


Comments: 

A charterboat operator stated that the total number of permits should be reduced, beginning with the inactive permits.
Under no circumstance should any new permits be issued. 
An individual suggested waiting until salmon numbers increase, and then giving first priority for new permits to
former permit holders who relinquished theirs. 
A tribe member stated that this should be coordinated with the treaty tribes and other entities involved, after studying
the natural and biological effects. 


Response: 

NMFS is proposing that, as a condition for receipt of buyout funds under this program, the administering authority
must ensure that reissuance of purchased permits will not be allowed. 
4. What should be the basis for the valuation of the permits, and should inactive permits be valuated differently?



Comments: 

A fisherman stated that permit value should relate to the current market value of Alaska troll permits that are for
sale. 
A charterboat operator commented that this should be decided by industry as a function of criteria for a permit buyout.
Valuation should logically reflect the level of activity in the fishery, i.e., greater value for the more active permits.

An individual stated that all active permits should have the same value; inactive permits should be valueless. 
A tribal individual's response to this question was ``economic hardship, and education.'' 


Response: 

NMFS is proposing not to set a value for permits, but to use a sealed bid process for conducting a permit buyout. However,
in no case may a buyout recipient receive benefits in excess of 75 percent of the total uninsured losses incurred for
the disaster period, or $100,000, whichever is less. 
5. What would be appropriate documentation to determine the extent of uninsured losses? 


Comments: 

One fisherman stated that a notarized statement from the vessel's captain should be required for determining aid
to deckhands.

Two commenters, a fisherman and a fisherman's wife, while not directly addressing this question, mentioned in their
comments that they are willing to provide documentation such as tax records to demonstrate their need. 
A charterboat operator stated that salmon landing tickets, income tax records, logbooks, charter office schedule
logs, etc., would be appropriate documentation. Grant recipients must be willing to sign affidavits that the information
is accurate. 
An individual stated that applicants should provide a record of the number of fish caught in previous years and those
presently caught, with a value assigned per fish species. Documentation should be in an affidavit, so that penalties
could be imposed in case of perjury. 
A tribe member stated that there is no way to determine accurately the overall extent of uninsured losses, the funds
are insufficient, but that a ``ballpark'' figure could be used to establish economic basis. 


Response: 

NMFS is proposing to consider any or all of the documentation suggested in the comments, and is also proposing to require
an affidavit that the information provided is accurate. 
6. What should be the starting and ending dates of the disaster period for purposes of awarding grants, and what factors
should the Secretary consider in determining these dates? 


Comments: 

A charterboat operator stated that the disaster period should begin as soon as administratively possible once criteria
are decided on, and extend at least to the end of calendar year 1994. 
An individual stated the disaster period should begin on January 1, 1995, and end ``when the fish numbers equal those
existing in 1972.'' 
A tribe member stated that, for the four treaty tribes, the problems began in 1977. 
A charterboat operator wanted assistance extended beyond 1994, until normal fishing seasons are established. 


Response: 

For the purposes of the NEAP program, NMFS is proposing that the disaster period begin on January 1, 1992, and end on
December 31, 1994. An ending date for the disaster is necessary in order to calculate the amount of the uninsured commercial
losses eligible for disaster relief under the NEAP. 
In addition to comments responding to the ANPR questions, the following comments were received: 


Comments: 

Thirteen commenters, including two Indian tribes, a trade association, a coastal zone management association,
the Pacific Fisheries Legislative Task Force, a state senator, four fishermen, two charterboat operators, and the
California Department of Fish and Game (CDF&G), were in favor of direct grants to fishermen, for maintenance,
moorage, safety improvements to vessels, or without any conditions for use. One of these commenters also recommended
grants for facilities such as ports. 
Several of these comments contained specific recommendations regarding the allocation of grant funds among the
three affected states; conditions for eligibility, emphasizing that grants should be provided to those most active
in the Northwest salmon fishery and those most in need; minimum and maximum grant amounts; and organizations through
which funds should be channeled. Two tribal governments requested direct aid under this proposal; one asked for funds
for two specific programs; the other recommended tribal administration of grant funds. This latter tribe further
recommended that 65 percent of the total aid go to Washington State, and of that allocation, 50 percent go to tribes
in the State. 


Response: 

Given the scope and limited financial resources available for NEAP, NMFS has attempted to devise a program to address
both short-term individual needs and long-term needs of the industry and the resources. FEMA and the DOL program are
accepting applications for direct grants from individuals affected by this situation. The IFA does not allow direct
grants to tribal governments. 


Comments: 

Eight commenters supported a program to employ fishermen in habitat restoration efforts, including a coastal zone
management association, a State senator, an Indian tribe, and CDF&G. A trade association stated that funds should
be administered through the Salmon Stamp Fund in California and the PSMFC in Oregon and Washington, and opposed use
of the SCS or RCD or community agencies. One charterboat operator supported habitat restoration jobs. Another charterboat
operator and a fisherman, while supporting habitat restoration, noted these are costly long-term projects; the
charterboat operator recommended that Congress give habitat restoration at least equal priority to Super Fund projects.
The Pacific Fisheries Legislative Task Force expressed support for nonprofit and citizen group efforts in this area.
A trade association opposed retraining on the grounds that only low-paying jobs were available. 


Response: 

NMFS concurs that a program employing fishermen to restore habitat would help address the short-term financial needs
of the participants who lost income due to the disaster. NMFS also recognizes that habitat restoration is a long-term
undertaking, but one that is needed to achieve recovery of the fishery. NMFS is proposing that the habitat restoration
program be administered through the SCS, which has access to private lands in coastal areas where a need to restore
habitat exists; an established track record in habitat restoration projects; and a history of working with Indian
tribes. 


Comments: 

One fisherman, a trade association, a coastal zone management association, and a State senator supported employing
fishermen to conduct at-sea surveys, stream monitoring and data collection to compensate for lost income. 


Response: 

NMFS concurs that a data collection jobs program would address some of the short- and long-term needs of the fishing
industry and of the resource. Data collection jobs provide an option for those unable to do habitat restoration work.
NMFS is proposing to use the PSMFC to administer the data collection jobs program.

Comments: 

Two fishermen commented in support of a permit buyout, with one recommending that all of the funds be used for this purpose,
after determining how many permits can remain in the fishery. An economic development council favored buyout of both
permits and vessels, to be implemented only if additional funds are made available. A charterboat operator supported
an unspecified buyout for ``businesses reliant on the salmon fishing.'' One individual noted that buying inactive
permits is ineffective. 

A trade association strongly opposed permit buyouts, citing lack of funds and the need to buy out both vessels and permits.
However, this group stated that a permit leaseback for a fixed time period might be necessary. A charterboat operator
stated that permit buyouts or leasebacks are impossible at this funding level, and would not reduce future harvests,
since only the least active would turn in their permits. He also noted that, since charterboats in Oregon and California
are not under limited entry permits, reduction of the charter fleet would not reduce recreational effort. A coastal
zone management association and a state senator stated that buyout or leaseback was an inappropriate use of the limited
funds. 



Response: 

NMFS believes that a program to buy out fishing permits is needed to provide immediate relief to fishermen and to reduce
the number of participants in the fishery. NMFS is proposing to allocate $4 million to a buyout program. NMFS recognizes
that permit buyouts would be feasible only in Washington at this time, since it is the only one of the affected states
that currently has a limited entry system without a fixed number of permits. California and Oregon laws provide that
new permits be issued to replace permits lost, in order to maintain an established number of existing permits. 



Comments: 

One fisherman supported a vessel buyout; another favored either a boat buyout or permit leaseback. A third fisherman
was strongly opposed to vessel buyouts, citing lack of funds and his belief that Washington State is trying to eliminate
the commercial industry in favor of recreational vessels. CDF&G also opposed a vessel buyout, as their State
Code mandates restoration, not elimination, of fisheries. 



Response: 

NMFS believes that, given the limited resources for the NEAP program, the buyout program should apply to permits and
not to vessels. Vessels could potentially be used in other fisheries. Relinquishing permits would have the desired
effect of removing participants from the commercial fishery for salmon. 



Comments: 

A county economic development council supported efforts in development, diversification, and tourism promotion.
However, two individuals involved in fishing opposed any funding of local governments, or businesses for tourism
or other development projects. One of these expressed concern that tourism efforts would promote recreational opportunities
in fisheries where commercial fishermen have been ``regulated off the stocks.'' 



Response: 

EDA has allocated $882,000, primarily for tourism development activities in local communities and for reclamation
projects in tribal communities. Tourism projects will not be funded under the proposed NEAP program, the purpose
of which is to compensate individual commercial fishermen for uninsured losses suffered as a direct result of the
West Coast salmon fishery disaster. 



Comments: 

Two individuals, one of these a member of an Indian tribe, commented that dams on spawning rivers are the main cause
of the salmon disaster. 



Response: 

NMFS recognizes that there are factors other than natural causes that are responsible for the decline in the West Coast
salmon resources. The proposed NEAP program is intended to address some of these factors, including habitat restoration.




Comments: 

A fisherman, a member of an Indian tribe, and another individual questioned the quality of the data used by NMFS in the
ANPR. 



Response: 

NMFS reviewed several studies that attempted to determine impacts of the disaster on various sectors. NMFS used the
best data available at the time the ANPR was drafted. 



Comment: 

The Washington Department of Fisheries and Wildlife provided an economic analysis of the impact of the salmon fishery,
indicating that Washington's loss is approximately 65 percent of the total, and probably much greater when tribal
impacts are considered. 



Response: 

After careful consideration of many factors, which are discussed elsewhere in this document, NMFS is proposing total
target distributions among the affected states as follows: For Washington, $6.6 million; for Oregon and California,
$2.7 million each. 



Comments: 

Two charterboat operators and a member of an Indian tribe made recommendations related to fishery management needs,
including development of quotas and specific closure recommendations. 



Response: 

NMFS recognizes that there are many management issues to be considered in rebuilding the salmon stocks. However,
such issues are beyond the scope of this action and should be raised in the appropriate fishery management forums.




Comment: 

One Indian tribe noted that the conditions impacting the coho and chinook stocks also affect the availability of Fraser
River sockeye to tribal fishermen. 



Response: 

The sockeye salmon fishery is not excluded from the proposed program; all five species of salmon in the West Coast fisheries
are included. 



Comment: 

A member of an Indian tribe mentioned the increasing U.S interception of Canadian salmon. 



Response: 

The United States and Canada are continuing to negotiate on this issue.

Section 308(d) of the IFA, codified at 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), authorizes the Secretary to award grants to persons engaged
in commercial fisheries, for uninsured losses determined by the Secretary to have been suffered as a direct result
of a fishery resource disaster. Set forth below are the conditions and definitions established by the Secretary to
implement the programs described in part III. 

The IFA requires that ``the Secretary shall determine the extent, and the beginning and ending dates of any fishery
resource disaster'' (16 U.S.C. 4107(d)(2)). Although there have been declining trends in landings from the salmon
fisheries in recent years, a sharp decline did not occur until after 1991. This sharp decline coincided with an extreme
El Nino ocean warming event during 1992-993. The 1994 season is the first season in which all ocean fisheries
for coho were closed; the projected chinook harvest for ocean fisheries indicates a new record low will be achieved,
eclipsing the previous record low in 1992. Therefore, for the purposes of the proposed NEAP program, the beginning
and ending dates of the fishery resource disaster are January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1994, respectively. 

The extent of this disaster includes the waters and habitat associated with the salmon fisheries of northern California,
Oregon and Washington. 



Proposed NEAP Program 



II. Definitions 



For the purposes of the proposed NEAP program: 



Commercial fishermen 

are vessel owners, operators, or crew directly involved in the commercial fishery. 



Commercial fishery 

is defined as the salmon fishery off the coasts and in the state waters of Washington, Oregon, and California for purposes
of either selling the salmon harvested or providing a vessel for hire that carries recreational fishermen to engage
in fishing for a fee (e.g., charterboats and headboats). Subsistence fisheries do not fall under this definition.




Commercial fishery income 

is earned income derived from participation in the commercial fishery. 



Gross income 

includes all income received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from Federal income
tax. 



Loss

 is defined as a loss of income not subject to Federal or state compensation and determined by a multi-step procedure,
as follows: 

1. The applicant (commercial fisherman) selects a base year from the years 1986 through 1989. 

2. The applicant determines his/her commercial fishery income from 1992 and 1993, and selects whichever is greater.


3. If the amount of the applicant's commercial fishery income from 1992 or 1993, as selected in step 2 above, is less
than the applicant's commercial fishery income from the base year, then a loss has occurred. The amount of the annual
loss is the difference between the applicant's base year commercial fishery income and that from 1992 or 1993, as selected
in step 2 above. 

4. The amount of the annual loss calculated in step 3 above is multiplied by three to determine the applicant's total
loss for the disaster period. 




(

Note: 

The Federal assistance programs announced in this notice are limited to compensation to commercial fishermen for
uninsured losses that have not been addressed through compensation from other state or Federal programs.) 






Salmon 

means chinook (king) salmon (

Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

), coho (silver) salmon (

Oncorhynchus kisutch

), pink (humpback) salmon (

Oncorhynchus gorbuscha

), chum (dog) salmon (

Oncorhynchus keta

), and sockeye (red) salmon (

Oncorhynchus nerka

). 



III. Program Descriptions 



A. Vessel Permit Buyout Program 



This program is intended to compensate commercial fishermen for uninsured lost income and to aid the long-term viability
of the fishery resource by reducing fishing effort on the stocks. Federal support for a buyout program stems from recommendations
for reducing long-term effects on the salmon resources, such as the recommendations of the Snake River Salmon Recovery
Team, which was appointed by NMFS to develop, independently, a recovery plan for Snake River sockeye, spring/summer
chinook, and fall chinook under the Endangered Species Act, and to take into account the conservation of other species
in the Columbia River Basin. Federal support for this particular type of buyout system is also based on a review of various
academic and governmental reports concerning past experiences with various buyout programs, and on discussions
with state officials, some of whom have experience with past buyout programs. Given the high number of slightly active
permit holders, a buyout program predicated on removing the maximum number of permits in order to reduce capacity
is appropriate for the salmon fisheries. 

The buyout program is generally modeled after the 1983-1986 Oregon Columbia River Gill Net Salmon Fleet Reduction
Program Oregon Program. The Oregon program had low administrative costs and was instituted quickly; it avoided the
difficult, contentious, and time-consuming task of assessing the market value of vessels and gear. The Oregon program
was based on the premise that fishermen, rather than the government, are in the best position to determine suitable
alternative uses or buyers for vessels after permits are sold. Also, the inherent difficulties in reducing effort
by attempting to buy out the most productive vessels are avoided. There are many reported instances where ``highliners''
(the most successful vessels) have been bought out at a high price, only to return to the fleet via the purchase of a low-priced
permit from a marginal producer. Consequently, the effort-reduction goals of the vessel buyout programs have been
thwarted.

NMFS will enter into cooperative agreements with qualified government entities that will serve as administrative
intermediaries. If more than one government entity wants to participate in this program, NMFS may select a primary
administrative intermediary to undertake the administration of the entire program. Qualified government entities
are those governments that administer limited-entry commercial salmon fisheries and can ensure that permits bought
out will not be replaced. 
Offers to sell gillnet or troll permits from commercial fishermen who participate under limited entry systems of
qualified government entities will be solicited by the administrative intermediary. These commercial fishermen
will need to demonstrate an uninsured loss as a result of the fishery resource disaster, as defined for the purposes
of NEAP. 
Permits will be selected for buyout based on a sealed bid process. Starting with the lowest offers, permits will be
purchased until the funds are exhausted. Maximum purchase prices for these permits will be limited to amounts that
ensure that the offerer (commercial fisherman) will not be receiving total benefits from this and any other program
that exceed 75 percent of his or her uninsured and otherwise uncompensated commercial fishery loss resulting from
this fishery resource disaster, and in no case more than $100,000 per individual. The administrative intermediary,
in consultation with NMFS, reserves the right to reject any and all bids. 
Only Washington State has indicated a strong interest in a buyout program and currently has a limited entry program
that meets the program requirements. Therefore, NMFS proposes that Washington State would function as the sole administrative
intermediary. However, if another state or tribal governmental entity has in place an appropriate limited-entry
system and wants to participate in the buyout program, NMFS will consider expanding the program accordingly. Washington
State, in consultation with NMFS, shall design a permit buyout program that is consistent with state and Federal management
and grant regulations, including a ``permit offer'' application that allows assessment of the uninsured loss of
the applicant, any receipt of benefits by the applicant from all other assistance programs associated with this disaster,
and the gross income of the applicant in 1993 (or, if married, the combined gross income of both spouses). The administrative
costs charged by Washington State shall be kept at a minimum; such costs should not exceed 7.5 percent of the total funds
distributed for this program. 

Based on estimates developed by the Washington Department of Fish and Game, approximately $4 million would be required
to reduce the Washington State troll and gillnet fleets by 50 percent each, based on an allocation of $1 million for
troll permit purchases and $3 million for gillnet permit purchases. It is anticipated that the final development
of this program can be initiated in early October 1994. 


B. Habitat Restoration Program 


There is considerable support among commercial fishermen for a habitat restoration program that would hire eligible
commercial fishermen (i.e., those who suffered uninsured losses as a result of the West Coast salmon fishery disaster),
both tribal and non-tribal, at a ``living wage'' to perform work that has a long-term beneficial impact on the habitat
of the salmon. Generally, ``living wages'' are wages commensurate with the prevailing rate for similar work conducted
in a specific locality. Depending on the locality and the skills required, living wage may range up to $10-$15
per hour. The types of work fishermen might do under this program would involve the operation of backhoes and skiploaders,
and undertaking the necessary plantings of vegetation. Generally, fishermen will need 1 to 2 days of training. Commercial
fishermen who meet the eligibility criteria would be hired on a first-come, first-served basis by contractors associated
with projects that have been solicited and approved by the administrative intermediary. 

Habitat restoration projects are to take place in areas geographically accessible to displaced fishermen, which
include the coastal counties from Mendocino County, CA, to Whatcom County, WA; Clallam County, WA; and counties bordering
on Puget Sound or the Columbia River. If in close commuting distance, projects can be undertaken in other counties,
if they contain habitat important to the salmon resources associated with the fishery resource disaster.

NMFS intends to enter into an agreement with the SCS to serve as the administrative intermediary for the habitat restoration
program. The SCS would enter into agreements with the appropriate state conservation agency, conservation commission,
or association of conservation districts, who, in turn, would develop: A grant solicitation process, including
guidelines for making a grant application; a grant application review process; deadlines for grant applications;
and a monitoring and evaluation process. Each state conservation agency, conservation commission, or association
of conservation districts would develop agreements with state employment departments to establish a program to
determine the eligibility of commercial fishermen according to the criteria described elsewhere in this notice.

NMFS has selected the SCS as the administrative intermediary because it has the necessary expertise, experience,
and other desirable features, as well as the ability to implement this program quickly by making use of existing governmental
organizations, while avoiding duplication of effort. The SCS has an established relationship with conservation
districts, which have project selection networks that extend to the local level and can be used for soliciting proposals.
SCS provides technical assistance to the conservation districts through its district offices, which are widely
distributed and are typically at the county level. Many of these conservation districts have previously received
Federal grants, and arrangements are in place to receive grants under this project. For each district, there are approximately
five officials who are landowners and are either appointed or elected via the general election process. These officials
make recommendations concerning private lands. The SCS reviews these recommendations and provides technical expertise
in the areas of forestry, range management, conservation, agronomy, etc. 
The SCS has significant expertise in habitat restoration and enhancement on private lands and on the grounds contracting
capability. This is important, since almost all Federal funding has gone toward restoration of habitat on public
lands. The SCS has demonstrated the capability and the flexibility to work with diverse organizations and proposal
applicants, such as other Federal agencies, state agencies, and local governments. The SCS is already involved in
the prevention of soil erosion through its watershed identification, habitat restoration, preservation, and enhancement
projects in Oregon, California, and Washington. The SCS is also already aware of Northwest salmon habitat issues,
as evidenced in working relationships with the Bonneville Power Administration and the Northwest Power Planning
Council (Council), and has initiated a program for habitat restoration in response to the Council's comprehensive
strategy for salmon and steelhead restoration in the Columbia River Basin. 
A number of SCS studies have already been developed that might be submitted for the review process. For example, in
the California Trinity River District, there is a project that may employ up to 75 fishermen. A similar project, which
could employ another 40 fishermen, has been developed for the Garcia River. 
While it is NMFS' intention and desire to make financial assistance available as soon as possible, it should be noted
that, due to the season and the need for project review, planning, and implementing, it is unlikely that many fishermen
will start receiving wages in this program prior to April 1, 1995. Every effort to expedite the program will be made.



C. Data Collection Jobs Program 


Commercial fishermen have voiced considerable interest in a jobs program associated with collecting information
or performing tasks that would be of use to scientists and fishery managers. 
Under this proposed program, eligible commercial fishermen, both tribal and non-tribal, would be hired on a first-come,
first-served basis, at a ``living wage,'' up to $10-15 per hour, to perform various tasks by contractors associated
with approved projects. Examples of these tasks include collecting tissue samples for genetic research, measuring
parameters of the ocean environment (temperature, upwelling, etc.), performing baseline surveys of habitat, participating
in test fisheries to determine ocean fish distribution, and assisting hatchery technicians in collecting information
or in improving hatchery operations. Commercial fishing vessels may also be chartered to do research. For some tasks,
as with the habitat restoration program, training of fishermen will be required.

Proposals would be competitively solicited by the administrative intermediary from states, tribes, academia,
and industry or conservation organizations for projects to be considered under this data collection jobs program.
These proposals would be ranked according to criteria established in section IV of this announcement. To ensure that
this program complements the habitat restoration program and does not duplicate other Federal assistance programs,
representatives from NMFS and SCS will be members of this review panel. Priority will be given to projects that provide
the greatest benefits to displaced fishermen; address the sustainability or rebuilding of anadromous species,
especially threatened or endangered salmon stocks; address Federal, Pacific Fishery Management Council, PSMFC,
or state fishery research needs; are based on sound scientific methodology; and have low administrative costs. Applicants
must demonstrate ability to manage and account for Federal funds. 
NMFS has chosen the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary for the data jobs program in the three affected states.
The PSMFC is an interstate fisheries commission established by Federal statute in 1947. It is a federally authorized
forum, wherein its member states (California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska) can legally enter into agreements
and programs extending beyond state boundaries. The PSMFC is run by 15 Commissioners (three per member state), who
include the state fishery agency director, a state legislator, and an appointee by the Governor from each state. The
goal of the PSMFC is ``to promote the conservation, development and management of Pacific coast fishery resources
through coordinated regional research, monitoring, and utilization.'' 
The Commissioners have set as one of the objectives of the PSMFC the facilitation of research and management projects
relating to interstate fisheries. To achieve this objective, they have directed the PSMFC staff to provide administrative,
fiscal, and field coordination and support for interstate and state/Federal research, data collection and management
projects. 
NMFS proposes the PSMFC as the administrative intermediary because PSMFC goals, objectives, and organizational
structure coincide largely with the implementation needs of this program. The PSMFC has a good track record of project
administration, and experience with project coordination with the three states and the tribes. Because of its proven
fiscal ability and low overhead, PSMFC regularly serves as a primary contractor on grants, projects, and contracts
for states and other organizations. The PSMFC is in an ideal position to implement the Data Collection Jobs Program,
because it already has knowledge of state, Federal, tribal and industry research priorities (recreational and commercial)
as coastwide data collection efforts and research are at the very core of the PSMFC's objectives. Additionally, the
PSMFC is well respected by fishermen because of its capabilities in reaching consensus and coordinating efforts
between the states. As a coordinator of the individual state catch statistics systems, which include salmon landings
by individual commercial fishing vessels, PSMFC should be able to verify much of the information that fishermen will
need to provide to PSMFC showing that they meet the eligibility criteria. 
The short-term benefits of this program would be to provide compensation to fishermen for uninsured lost income due
to the closed or restricted salmon seasons. The long-term advantages would be to improve collection of information
important to sustaining salmon stocks. An additional benefit is that it could foster a better understanding between
fishermen, scientists, and fishery managers. The timing of the actual employment of fishermen will depend on the
planning and proposal selection process, as well as the best seasons in which to undertake research. 


IV. Eligibility Criteria 


For purposes of the proposed habitat restoration and data collection programs under NEAP, job applicants must meet
all of the following eligibility criteria to receive assistance: 
1. The applicant must show an uninsured loss. 
2. In the base year used by the applicant in determining loss, the applicant must have earned at least 50 percent of gross
income from the commercial fishery. 
3. The applicant must have earned commercial fishery income in either 1992 or 1993. 
4. The applicant's 1992 or 1993 commercial fishery income, whichever is greater, must have declined by at least 50
percent from the applicant's commercial fishery income from the base year selected. 
5. If single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000. If married, the applicant's 1993
gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000. 
No person may receive financial assistance under NEAP that exceeds 75 percent of any uninsured and otherwise uncompensated
commercial fishery loss resulting from the fishery resource disaster, and no person may receive more than $100,000
in the aggregate for all losses resulting from the disaster. 
The intent of these criteria is to provide the available assistance to those commercial fishermen who have been most
heavily dependent on salmon fishing and who have suffered the greatest losses. In order to comply with the requirements
of the IFA, an uninsured loss must be shown. The second criterion is intended to determine those applicants that have
been dependent on the commercial fishery for most of their livelihood. The third criterion is intended to limit eligibility
to those who commercially fished during the disaster period. The final two criteria are intended to focus the available
financial assistance on those commercial fishermen who have suffered the greatest losses due to the disaster and
who do not have significant income from other sources.

<TEXT>
 


In applying for any of the proposed programs, a commercial fisherman must submit documentation, including salary,
earnings, or crew-share statements and affidavits that demonstrate eligibility. 



NMFS believes the proposed eligibility criteria are reasonable. Two studies that produced socio-economic profiles
on non-tribal Oregon trollers and California fishermen (the majority of which were salmon fishermen) for 1988 found:
The average commercial fisherman received 34 to 56 percent of total family income from salmon fishing; total family
income ranged from $50,000 to $54,000; 78 to 82 percent were married; if married, there were 2.8 children to support,
with less than 50 percent of their spouses working; and West Coast salmon fishermen had a weekly income of $1,200 to
$1,500 from salmon landings. Oregon trollers who fish in Alaska may earn 45 percent of their income from Alaskan salmon.
The percentage of trollers who fish off Alaska is not available. A third study showed that more than one-third of the
Washington fleet may have Alaskan salmon permits. This fleet appears to harvest off Alaska two to three times the value
of the entire Washington State commercial landings, based on a review of 1985 and 1988 statistics. 



The proposed criteria also appear reasonable based on an analysis of fish ticket data for non-tribal and non-charterboat
vessels for all species of fish landed in California, Washington, and Oregon. Of the 12,009 vessels that earned at
least $1 in any of the years 1986 through 1993, only 2,879 appear to meet the proposed eligibility criteria. During
1993, these vessels collectively earned $9 million in West Coast salmon revenues, averaging almost $4,000 each,
compared to a peak year average of $24,268. Data on non-fishing and Alaska fishing income are unavailable, but, when
that income is included, it is expected to reduce the number of vessels that would meet the proposed eligibility criteria
below 2,879. Assuming that crew size for trollers and gillnetters averages 1.4 crew members per vessel, potentially
4,700 fishermen may be eligible for the jobs program under the first four proposed criteria. 



Approximately 519 charterboats are licensed in Washington, Oregon, and California. If charterboats have an average
crew size of 2.4, approximately 1,200 individuals could potentially apply for aid. California charterboats have
been classified as either active_those that landed more than 100 salmon, or 
casual_those that landed from 1 to 100 salmon. Based on 1993 landings, 47 percent of the California charterboat fleet
was designated casual. If casual charterboats are not likely to meet the proposed eligibility criteria, then applying
the 53-percent estimate for active charterboats to the entire charterboat fleet within the area of the fishery disaster
suggests that approximately 600 charterboat operators and crew members may be eligible to receive financial assistance
under the proposed NEAP program. 



In Washington State, 2,000 tribal fishermen made landings in 1993, compared to 3,000 in 1990. This decline is largely
attributed to salmon fishery closures. The current tribal population is approximately 17,500. Information supplied
by the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission suggests that tribal revenues from salmon catches in Puget Sound declined
by $13 million, comparing averages for 1990-92 to 1993. According to 1990 Bureau of Census data, Native Americans
in the State of Washington had an average per-capita income of $6,646 in 1990. Tribal salmon catches in the other states
indicate that there may be fewer than 500 additional tribal fishermen along the remaining coast. This is an uncertain
estimate; NMFS specifically requests information on tribal participation in commercial salmon fisheries in response
to this notice. 




V. Program and State Funding Targets 





NMFS anticipates that the proposed NEAP program would result in the following distribution of available financial
assistance among the affected states and programs: 55 percent of available funds would be distributed to the State
of Washington and 22.5 percent of available funds would be distributed to each of the States of Oregon and California.

Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan








NMFS emphasizes that these are ``target'' distributions, not fixed percentages, and are flexible; redistributions
could be made, if increased total benefits can be achieved. The final distribution would depend on the needs of the
commercial fishermen. For example, should other governmental entities besides Washington State want to participate
in the proposed buyout program, a portion of the buyout funds currently proposed to be distributed to Washington would
have to be redistributed. In the project selection phase of the habitat restoration program, it may be recognized
that total benefits will be greater by shifting more of the projects toward one state than another. However, there
is a need to distribute initially a sufficient amount of funds to operate the programs effectively in each state. 



Program distributions are largely based on the following considerations: Habitat needs are found in all three states,
and habitat restoration is critical to increase the long-term sustainability of salmon resources; only Washington
State has indicated a willingness to participate in a permit buyout program; and fishermen have voiced desires to
participate in programs to collect needed habitat, conservation, and management information. 



Because additional listings of West Coast salmon stocks under the Endangered Species Act are expected, and closures
of salmon fisheries are likely to continue as a result, a phase-down of the fishing industry via a buyout program is
needed. A phase-down of the industry needs to be initiated to increase the long-term economic health of the industry,
as suggested by the Snake River Recovery Team (Snake River Salmon Recovery Team: Final Recommendations to the National
Marine Fisheries Service, May 1994). 



Information on landings, commercial revenues, recreational expenditures, and estimates of jobs associated with
the various sectors of the industry were reviewed. Recognizing various uncertainties, this information was reviewed
in the context of: The definition of commercial fisherman, as defined by the IFA; the realization that coho and chinook
are the prime species associated with the fishery resource disaster; and the availability of alternative opportunities
to commercial fishermen. 



Because of the large Puget Sound and tribal fisheries, available data and information imply that fishermen in Washington
State should have the greatest share of the funds, given the State's share of the industry. Providing equal shares
to California and Oregon is partially based on economic analyses developed for the Pacific Fishery Management Council.
Trends in estimated community/local personal income impacts of the California and Oregon fisheries were compared.
Comparing 1986-90 averages to 1993 levels indicates that Oregon has had a greater loss (approximately $50 million)
compared to California (approximately $42 million). So, while California has a larger fishery, Oregon appears to
have had a greater loss on a percentage basis. In addition, commercial fishermen in Oregon may have fewer alternative
fishing opportunities than those who reside in California and Washington. Northern California commercial fishermen
can fish on salmon stocks for which fishing has not been prohibited, while many Washington vessels have permits to
fish off Alaska. 



The state targets do not necessarily reflect the ultimate distribution of benefits. For example, should only Washington
State vessel permit holders participate in the buyout program, commercial fishermen from all three states would
benefit, because there would be fewer commercial fishermen competing for shared salmon resources. In addition,
the results of the proposed jobs program in each state are expected to provide coastwide benefits. 




Classification 





This action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 



This action proposes a financial assistance program that would contain collection-of-information requirements
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The necessary information collection forms and specific reporting requirements
have not been identified at this time, and will need to be developed in conjunction with the intermediaries administering
the program. When the requirements have been established, NMFS will submit them to OMB for approval prior to their
implementation.

SUMMARY: 

The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces will hold a closed meeting on Wednesday, September 7, 1994,
from 11:00 p.m. until 12:30 p.m. in Pentagon Room 2E877, Washington, DC. 


The Commission meeting will consist of a briefing from the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
discussing operational missions assigned to each Service. Material presented will include both classified and
unclassified information in a format that makes it impractical to separate the two. In accordance with section 552b(c)(1)
of Title 5 U.S.C. disclosure of such classified information would be contrary to the interests of national defense,
therefore this meeting will be closed to the public.
Extraordinary circumstances created by scheduling conflicts compel notice of this meeting to be posted in less than
the 15 day required.
For further information, contact CDR Gregg Hartung, USN, Director for Public Affairs, (703) 696-4250.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 








A. Purpose


To protect the Government's interest and to ensure timely delivery of items of the requisite quality, contracting
officers, prior to award, must make an affirmative determination that the prospective contractor is responsible,


i.e.,

 capable of performing the contract. Before making such a determination, the contracting officer must have in his
possession or must obtain information sufficient to satisfy himself that the prospective contractor (i) has adequate
financial resources, or the ability to obtain such resources, (ii) is able to comply with required delivery schedule,
(iii) has a satisfactory record of performance, (iv) has a satisfactory record of integrity, and (v) is otherwise
qualified and eligible to receive an award under appropriate laws and regulations. If such information is not in the
contracting officer's possession, it is obtained through a preaward survey conducted by the contract administration
office responsible for the plant and/or the geographic area in which the plant is located. The necessary data is collected
by contract administration personnel from available data or through plant visits, phone calls, and correspondence
and entered on Standard Forms 1403, 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407, and 1408 in detail commensurate with the dollar value and
complexity of the procurement. The information is used by Federal contracting officers to determine whether a prospective
contractor is responsible.


B. Annual Reporting Burden


Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 24 hours per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the date needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services
Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer,

<DOCTITLE>Clearance Request for Subcontracting Plans/Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts (Standard Form 294)</DOCTITLE>


AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for a revision to an existing OMB clearance (9000-0006).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve a revision
of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Subcontracting Plans/Subcontracting
Reporting for Individual Contracts (Standard Form 294).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Purpose


In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 

et seq

.), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns
participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract of a modification
to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides
maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required
to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and implemented in FAR subpart 19.7.
FAR case 92-39 proposes to increase the effective period for master subcontracting plans from 1 year to 3 years
(FAR 19.704). This change is expected to decrease the number of subcontract plans per year and associated hours by
approximately 10 percent.
In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit semiannual reports of their progress on Standard Form 294,
Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts.
A satisfactory subcontracting plan is required before a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
can be awarded. The contracting officer must examine the information in the proposed plan to determine if the plan
is in compliance with the Small Business Act and the FAR. In addition, the information is used for policy and management
control purposes.
Information submitted on Standard Form 294 is used to assess contractors' compliance with their subcontracting
plans.


B. Annual Reporting Burden


Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets NW., room 4037,
Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.
The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,625; responses per respondent, 14; total annual
responses, 22,750; preparation hours per response, 11; and total response burden hours, 250,250.


C. Annual Recordkeeping Burden


The annual recordkeeping burden is estimated as follows: Recordkeepers, 1,625; hours per recordkeeper, 121; and
total recordkeeping burden hours 196,625.



Obtaining Copies Of Proposals: 

Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR
Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501-4755. Please cite OMB Control No.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance for Utility Battery Storage Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Award a Noncompetitive Financial Assistance.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Albuquerque Operations Office (AL), pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), intends to award, on a noncompetitive basis,
a cooperative agreement to Omnion Power Engineering Corporation of East Troy, Wisconsin.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose to be served by this award is to advance the Department's goal of cooperating with the electric utility
and manufacturing industries to develop battery storage systems as an economically attractive utility resources
option by the end of this decade. Battery energy storage can help utilities address: increased competition with respect
to electricity supply, greater required energy efficiency, and more restrictive environmental regulations by
improving: cost-effectiveness, reliability, and power quality, and by reducing the environmental impact of electricity
generation and distribution. The particular significance of the development to be funded is a demonstrable battery
storage system that can be evaluated and tested by an electric utility. It is anticipated that the cost-shared cooperative
agreement will be funded annually for a total project period of two years. The government's funding of this cooperative
agreement is subject to the availability of funds.



This noncompetitive action is based on continuation of this program which is presently funded by the DOE and for which
competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the program.

[Docket No. QF92-91-004]



On August 19, 1994, Tenaska Washington Partners, L.P. (Tenaska) of 1044 North 115 Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska
68154, submitted for filing an application for recertification of a facility as a qualifying cogeneration facility
pursuant to Section 292.207(b) of the Commission's Regulations. No determination has been made that the submittal
constitutes a complete filing. 

According to the applicant, the topping-cycle cogeneration facility is located at the BP Oil Refinery in Ferndale,
Washington. The facility consists of two combustion turbine generators, two supplementary-fired heat recovery
boilers, and an extraction/condensing steam turbine generator (STG). Steam recovered from the STG is used in the
heating of hydrocarbons and the evaporation of liquid hydrocarbons for distillation and refining. The primary energy
source is natural gas. The maximum net electric power production capacity of the facility is 245 MW. 


The certification of the facility was originally issued to Tenaska on June 3, 1992, (59 FERC  62,235 (1992)),
and the recertification issued on November 23, 1993, (65 FERC  62,171 (1993)). The instant recertification
is requested by the applicant to reflect a recent restructuring of the ownership of the partnership. All other facility
characteristics remain unchanged as described in the previous certification and recertification. 



Comment date: 

October 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. 



Standard Paragraphs

should be filed on or before the comment date. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public

from Southern. 
Southern states that the abandonment of facilities proposed in this application would not result in any termination
of service and would not result in a change to any volumes delivered to Alagasco.

by the Commission's Order of March 31, 1994.


In addition, in accordance with the Commission's May 31, 1994, order clarifying the March 31, 1994, suspension order,
U-TOS moves to place into effect on September 1, 1994, the suspended tariff sheets, without refund condition,

tariff sheets which eliminated its Interruptible Revenue Crediting Mechanism. On March 31, 1994, the Commission
issued an order that, among other things, accepted U-TOS' tariff sheets and suspended them for five months,

Mechanism, the Commission provided in its March 31, 1994, suspension that they could go into effect on September 1,
1994, subject to refund and hearing. However, in its June 23, 1994, ``Order Clarifying Previous Order and Denying
Rehearing'' the Commission clarified that the tariff sheets which eliminated the Interruptible Revenue Crediting
Mechanism could go into effect on September 1, 1994, without refund condition and without being subject to a hearing.

North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedures, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before September 8, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

necessary for WNG to reconfigure its measurement facilities to more accurately determine the volumes delivered
to WRI and MGE. WNG asserts that the gas delivered through the new facilities is not additional volume, but rather individual
measurement of existing volumes, which will not exceed the total volume authorized prior to this request.



WNG proposes (1) to install measurement and appurtenant facilities at a new site in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Roe,
and at a new site in Wyandotte County, Kansas for WRI/Fairfax; (2) to replace measurement and appurtenant facilities
size for size in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Metcalf; (3) to replace measurement and appurtenant facilities with
larger facilities in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Antioch; and (4) to install new measurement and appurtenant
facilities in Johnson County, Kansas for MGE/Stateline. WNG indicates that MGE/Stateline and WRI/Roe will share
the new site. WNG estimates that the total cost to construct these facilities will be approximately $1,303,600, to
be paid with available funds.



WNG states that inasmuch as this is a request to install measuring and appurtenant facilities for existing customers
at new locations in order to more accurately measure volumes of transportation gas delivered, these changes are not
prohibited by an existing tariff, and it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries specified without
detriment or disadvantage to WNG's other customers.


Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>





M.A. Norden Company Site, AL; Modification of June 15, 1984, Clean Water Act Section 404(c) Final Determination 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of modification of section 404(c) final determination and notice of availability. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has modified the June 15, 1984, Clean Water Act section 404(c) Final
Determination concerning the Norden site in Mobile, Alabama. The modification means that the M.A. Norden Company,
Inc. may apply for a section 404 permit to discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States in order
to construct an access road across the section 404(c) prohibited site. EPA concludes that these proposed activities
will not result in unacceptable adverse effects under section 404(c). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to prohibit or restrict the use of portions of waters of the United
States for discharging dredged or fill material. In October, 1992, M.A. Norden Company, Inc. petitioned EPA to modify
its 1984 section 404(c) Final Determination concerning the Norden site to enable it to construct a road across the
site to access adjacent uplands. 


EPA announced Norden Company's request for modification of the Norden Final Determination and requested public
comment in the May 13, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25050). EPA formally notified the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters (Corps Headquarters) of the Norden
Company petition and requested any comments on the Norden Company proposal. EPA also mailed copies of the 

Federal Register

 notice to other parties believed to be interested in the proposed action. 
EPA received no comments from the public in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice. Corps Headquarters responded in a July 1, 1994, letter to EPA and indicated that they had no comment at this
time so that they might maintain their ability to make an objective and independent decision on a permit application
from Norden Company, should EPA modify their Final Determination. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alabama Field
Office (FWS), submitted comments in a June 7, 1994, letter. While neither supporting nor objecting to reconsideration
of the Final Determination, they indicated that there may be less environmentally damaging alternatives to the proposed
road fill and that these alternatives should be fully explored. 
EPA carefully reviewed Norden Company's proposal, comments submitted by Corps Headquarters and FWS, and the existing
Norden section 404(c) record. Based on this review, EPA concluded that environmental impacts associated with the
proposed road construction would not result in unacceptable adverse effects to the Norden 404(c) area. In reaching
this decision, EPA considered that the impacts of the current Norden Company proposal are significantly less than
those of the original proposal which precipitated the section 404(c) action. The original Final Determination noted
that the Norden site was a ``productive wetland, typical of the area, that contributes organic material to the fish
and shellfish communities of the Mobile Bay estuary, provides valuable habitat for wildlife, and acts as a pollutant
filtering mechanism which helps to reduce degradation of water quality in the adjacent open water system.'' The originally
proposed 25 acres of impacts to waters of the United States have been reduced through the modification of the project
so that approximately 1.5 acres will be impacted. In addition, the project will be constructed in such a way as to 
allow for downstream transport of detritus and continued connection to the Mobile Bay estuary. 
The Norden Company has made a prima facie showing that there are no practicable alternatives which are less environmentally

damaging. Alternate routes which would avoid the wetlands do not seem to be practicable based on the information available.
If the Final Determination is modified, the project must still go through the Corps' permit process, where the issue
of practicable, less damaging alternatives will receive thorough investigation. Under the circumstances, the
theoretical possibility of alternatives does not make the limited impacts of the revised project unacceptable.

For these reasons, EPA has concluded that it is appropriate to modify the original June 15, 1984, Final Determination
to allow M.A. Norden Company, Inc. to seek authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to discharge dredged
or fill material into waters of the United States associated with the construction of the road described in the Norden
Company's submissions to EPA on October 5, 1992, and August 5, 1993, and summarized above. Prior to any discharge activities,
however, the project must be authorized pursuant to applicable permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.

<DOCTITLE>Public Meeting on the Draft National Waste Minimization Plan </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of meeting. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 18, 1993, EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced, with the release of the Draft Hazardous Waste Minimization
and Combustion Strategy, that EPA was taking a leadership role in reducing the amount of hazardous waste produced
in this country and strengthening federal controls governing hazardous waste incinerators, boilers, and industrial
furnaces. 


As part of that Strategy, EPA developed and released a Draft RCRA Waste Minimization National Plan in May of 1994. EPA's
goal is to finalize the Phase I portion of the Plan by November 1994. Phase I is the primary vehicle for promoting source
reduction and, secondarily, environmentally sound recycling of waste streams containing persistent, bioaccumulative,
and toxic compounds, and particularly metals and/or halogens that are likely to be combusted in boilers and industrial
furnaces or hazardous waste incinerators. Phase II of the Plan will focus beyond hazardous wastes managed in combustion
units to promote source reduction and recycling for wastes managed by other practices. 
In order to gain early and substantive input on Phase I, EPA will hold a three-day focus group meeting September 20-22,
1994, with invited participants. Participants will include individuals from federal, state and local government,
industry, public interest and environmental groups, technical assistance centers, and labor. 
EPA will convene separate Focus Group sessions on: 
(1) Prioritization of Wastes. Discussions will focus on the methodology that EPA has developed to prioritize waste
minimization efforts associated with wastes that are combusted. A 

Federal Register

 Notice, 59FR 41442, dated August 12, 1994 announced the availability of a Draft Methodology Document and asked for
comments on the draft by September 9, 1994. 
(2) Goals. Topics will include: development of a goal statement for minimizing hazardous wastes that are combusted,
particularly when such reductions will lead to multi-media environmental benefits and will reduce persistent,
bioaccumulative, and toxic constituents; expediting continual improvement in seeking source reduction and environmentally
sound recycling options at the top of the waste management hierarchy; and improving the recycling and management
of wastes that cannot be reduced in a way that results in a net reduction of environmental loadings to all media. 
(3) Voluntary Programs and Incentives. Topics will include discussion of currently existing voluntary programs/incentives
and how they either overlap with the goals of Phase I, or do not meet Phase I objectives; and options, both pro and con,
of using existing programs/incentives versus new initiatives to get real reductions of wastes of concern. 
(4) Incorporating waste minimization in RCRA permits. Discussions will include the status of federal and state efforts
to incorporate waste minimization into RCRA permits, inspections and enforcement actions. Comments will be invited
regarding the pros and cons of these approaches. 
Members of the public are invited to attend the meeting as observers. Written comments will be accepted at the meeting.
Additionally, there will be time allotted following participants discussions to take comments from observers.
The Meeting will be held Tuesday, September 20 through Thursday, September 22 at the Holiday Inn Bethesda, 8120 Wisconsin
Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland (301) 652-2000. Please contact the hotel directly for further information on the
meeting facilities and lodging. For information on the meeting (e.g. the agenda and issues) or to request special
needs services for observers such as sign language interpretation, contact Sandra Farrell at (703) 308-8402.


 

An Executive Summary of the proceedings of the Focus Groups Meeting will be prepared and made publicly available following
the Meeting.

<DOCTITLE>Bacteriophages of Xanthomonas campestris subsp. vesicatoria; Establishment of Temporary Exemption from Tolerance
</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has established an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for bacteriophages isolated from 

Xanthomonas campestris 

subsp. 

vesicatoria

 in or on the raw agricultural commodities tomatoes and peppers. This exemption has been established by the Agency
on its own initiative.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA received from AgriPhi, Inc., 160 North Main, Logan, Utah 84321, an application for an Experimental Use Permit
for proposed field testing of the efficacy of a product containing bacteriophages isolated from bacterial lesions
on tomato and pepper plants produced by 

Xanthomonas campestris 

subsp. 

vesicatoria

. In order to further the research efforts of this small company in the development of innovative biological pest control
technology, the Agency has established a temporary exemption from the requirement for a tolerance of these bacteriophages
in or on the raw agricultural commodities tomatoes and peppers. This temporary exemption will permit the marketing
of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the Experimental Use
Permit 67986-EUP-1 which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136).


The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated and it was determined that establishment
of a temporary tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Public literature citations were referenced
which indicate that bacteriophages are specific to their bacterial host and present no unique toxicity hazards to
humans or wildlife. Research has been conducted on bacteriophages for the past 80 years with no documented cases of
adverse effects to man or the environment. 
Bacteriophages are commonly occurring in nature and would normally be found on raw agricultural commodities. Therefore,
a temporary tolerance has been established on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the Experimental
Use Permit and with the following provisions:
1.  The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the Experimental
Use Permit.
2.  AgriPhi, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration.
This temporary exemption from tolerance requirements expires August 15, 1996. Residues remaining in or on the raw
agricultural commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally
applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit. This tolerance
exemption may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this
biological pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 2 of Executive order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; receipt and availability of petition.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document announces the receipt of a petition proposing the revocation of the section 409 food additive regulations
established under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) for propargite on raisins and dry grape pomace.
The petitioner also requests that EPA not pursue a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite in raisin waste.
This notice sets forth the basis for the petitioner's proposal and provides opportunity for public comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction


 Statutory Framework


Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances
and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and
section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed
foods. 
Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide
residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide
residues in processed foods are established under section 409 of the act. Section 409 food additive regulations are
required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA,
no section 409 food additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting from use
on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance for that
pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision
because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409 food additive
regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of good manufacturing
practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the tolerance prescribed
for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide.
Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA).
The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will
be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides
that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21
U.S.C. 348(c)(5)).
EPA reviews residue chemistry and toxicology data in setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food additive
regulations. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when the pesticide
is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section 408 tolerances,
EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity based on controlled
field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected to yield maximum
residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is needed depends on
whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide residues
would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance.


II. Petitions


Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the food and feed additive regulations
established under section 409 of the FFDCA for propargite on raisins and dry grape pomace. In addition, the petitioner
requests that EPA withdraw its petition to establish a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite in raisin
waste. Propargite is the active ingredient in Omite miticides registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims that Omite
is a nonsystemic contact miticide that acts primarily by surface contact and that surface residues are susceptible
to release through mechanical and/or washing processes. 
To support these claims, the Petitioner submitted two studies: A propargite Market Basket study, which was submitted
on September 15, 1992, and a processing study submitted with this petition. The petition involves raisins, dry grape
pomace as animal feed, and raisin waste as animal feed. The following sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request.
The Petitioner asserts that the processing study shows that propargite residues do not concentrate in raisins. The
Petitioner also asserts that the processing study supports the results of Uniroyal's Market Basket study showing
residues of propargite in raisins to be in the range of 0.02 to 0.69 part per million (ppm). The section 408 tolerance
for propargite in grapes is currently established at 10 ppm (40 CFR 180.259). Therefore, the Petitioner asserts that
the section 409 food additive regulation is not needed at this time. 
In regard to dry grape pomace, again the Petitioner claims that the section 409 food additive regulation for dry grape
pomace is not needed because residues of propargite do not concentrate above the level of section 408 tolerance in
grapes. Furthermore, Uniroyal contends that since dry grape pomace is not ``intended for use as a substantial source
of nutrients in the diet of the animal,'' it does not meet the definition of ``animal feed'' in section 201(x) of the
FFDCA. Finally, the Petitioner asserts that even if dry grape pomace is used, it would be diluted with other food matter
and when ``ready to eat'' would not exceed the section 408 tolerance for grapes. For these reasons, Uniroyal believes
that the section 409 food additive regulation for propargite on dry grape pomace is not needed. The section 409 food
additive regulation for propargite on dry grape pomace is 40 ppm (40 CFR 186.5000). 
In regard to raisin waste, Uniroyal presents two reasons why EPA should not pursue a section 409 food additive regulation
for propargite in raisin waste. First, Uniroyal maintains that residues of propargite in raisin waste would not be
expected to exceed the section 408 tolerance in grapes. Second, since raisin waste has low nutritional value and is
usually discarded, it does not meet the definition of an ``animal feed'' under FFDCA section 201(x). Therefore, the
Petitioner requests that EPA not pursue a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite on raisin waste. 
It should be noted that in the 

Federal Register

 of July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33941), EPA issued a proposed rule to revoke the section 409 food additive regulation for propargite
in raisins because the Agency has determined that propargite induces cancer in animals. Thus, the regulation violates
the Delaney Clause in section 409 of the FFDCA. The Agency has not yet proposed similar actions for the feed additive
regulations for propargite.
Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response
to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected
by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th
day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).

<DOCTITLE>BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>




BankAmerica Corporation

, San Francisco, California (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act
(12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage 

de novo

 through its wholly owned subsidiary, BA Securities, Inc., San Francisco, California (Company), a broker-dealer
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 

et seq.

), in underwriting and dealing, to a limited extent, in all types of debt and equity securities, including without
limitation, corporate debt securities, sovereign debt securities, and securities issued by a trust or other vehicle
secured by or representing interests in debt obligations, and common stock, American Depositary Receipts, Global
Depository Receipts, securities convertible into equity securities and options, and other direct and indirect
equity ownership interests in domestic and foreign corporations and other entities, warrants and other rights issued
in connection with the above securities, and securities issued by closed-end investment companies, but not including
ownership interests in open-end investment companies.
Applicant also proposes to engage through Company in the following activities that it maintains are incidental to
the proposed underwriting and dealing activities: (1) providing investment advice to issuers of securities regarding
such matters as the timing and structure of particular issues; (2) risk management activities respecting its underwriting
and dealing activities, including the purchase and sale of futures, options, and options on futures to the extent
permitted under applicable Board interpretation, as well as the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in spot or
forward markets as may be necessitated by Company's underwriting or dealing in foreign currency-denominated securities;
and (3) underwriting debt and equity securities on a best efforts basis. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities
throughout the United States and the world.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity;
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 Federal Register 806 (1984).
The Board previously has approved, by order, underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, all types of debt and
equity securities. 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192 (1989) (1989 Section 20 Order), 

as modified by

 Order dated September 21, 1989, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989) (Modification Order) and the Order dated January
4, 1990 (Foreign Bank Order). Applicant has stated that, except as described below, it will conduct the proposed underwriting
and dealing activities using the same methods and procedures, and subject to the same prudential limitations established
by the Board in the 1989 Section 20 Order, as modified by the Modification Order, including the Board's 10 percent revenue
limitation on such activities. For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the application would not be
barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank
with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities.
Applicant also maintains that the Board has determined that the proposed investment advisory, risk management,
and best efforts underwriting activities are incidental to the proposed underwriting and dealing activities. 

See First Chicago Corporation

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 449, 451 n.7 (1994); 

BankAmerica

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1163 (1993) (investment advisory activities); 

see, e.g.

, 12 CFR 225.142; 

Deutsche Bank AG

, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 133, 139 (1993) (risk management); 

see J.P. Morgan & Co. et al.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192, 213 n.59 (1989) (best efforts underwriting).
Applicant has submitted a request for a confirmation that foreign subsidiaries, including the foreign bank subsidiaries,
of Company's bank affiliates (Foreign Affiliates) are not subject to the section 20 firewalls relating to cross-marketing
activities. 

See J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, et al.

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192, 215 (1989). Applicant also proposes to permit the Foreign Affiliates to sell bank-ineligible
securities underwritten by, dealt in, or placed by Company to institutional customers as defined in Regulation Y
and accredited investors as defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Applicant also proposes
to permit the Foreign Affiliates to recommend bank-ineligible securities to institutional customers and accredited
investors provided that disclosure of Company's role in underwriting, dealing in, or placing the securities is made
to the customers. Applicant argues that the scope of these firewalls should be limited to U.S. affiliates of section
20 companies and that the extension of these firewalls to the foreign subsidiaries, including the foreign bank subsidiaries,
of Company's bank affiliates is not warranted in light of the regulatory framework applicable to these foreign subsidiaries,
and that to do so would impose serious competitive disadvantages on Applicant.
Applicant also proposes to have Company enter into certain transactions with certain foreign affiliates and with
Applicant subject to the limitations previously imposed by the Board in letters to J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.,
dated June 19, 1989 (Morgan Letters), except for the parent company guarantee described in the Morgan Letters in connection
with certain repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions involving U.S. Treasury securities. Applicant otherwise
would continue to comply with the Section 20 Firewalls set forth in 

J.P. Morgan, supra

, as modified subsequently by the Board.
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition, lower
financing costs, and more innovative financing. Applicant also believes that approval of this application will
allow Company to provide a wider range of services and added convenience to its customers. Applicant believes that
the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than September 28, 1994. Any request
for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)),
be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

<DOCTITLE>First of America Bank Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>




First of America Bank Corporation

, Kalamazoo, Michigan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C.
1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage 

de novo

 through a wholly owned subsidiary, First of America Securities, Inc., Kalamazoo, Michigan (Company), in the following
securities-related activities: (1) underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, rated and unrated debt securities,
including only municipal revenue bonds (including industrial development bonds), mortgage-related securities,
consumer receivable-related securities, commercial paper, and securities issued by a trust or other vehicle secured
by or representing interests in such debt obligations (bank-ineligible securities); (2) acting as agent for issuers
in the private placement of all types of debt and equity securities, including providing related advisory services;
(3) buying and selling securities on the order of investors as a ``riskless'' principal; (4) intermediating in the
swaps markets by acting as an originator and principal in interest rate and currency swap transactions, and transactions
in ``swap derivative products'' such as caps, floors and collars, and options on swaps, caps, floors and collars,
(a) acting as broker and agent with respect to the foregoing transactions and instruments, and (b) acting as adviser
to institutional customers regarding financing strategies involving interest rate and currency swaps and derivative
swap products; (5) providing foreign exchange advisory and transactional services; and (6) providing advice in
connection with merger, acquisition, divestiture, recapitalization and financing transactions, including feasibility

net worth individuals, and to provide ancillary services or functions incidental to these activities; valuations
for financial and nonfinancial institutions and high net worth individuals; fairness opinions in connection with
merger, acquisition and similar transactions for financial and nonfinancial institutions and high net worth individuals
and ancillary services or functions incidental to the foregoing advisory activities (collectively ``financial
advisory activities''). Company has previously received Federal Reserve System approval to engage in full-service
brokerage activities, providing financial advice to state and local governments, and underwriting and dealing
in bank-eligible securities. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the United States. 
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires

that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity;
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form.

the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
The Board has previously approved, by regulation, financial advisory activities and providing foreign exchange
transactional and advisory services. 

See

, 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(vi) and (17). Applicant has stated that it will conduct these proposed activities subject to

The Board also has previously approved, by order, underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, bank-ineligible
securities.

as modified by

 Order dated September 21, 1989, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989) (Modification Order). Applicant has stated

methods and procedures, and subject to the same prudential limitations established by the Board in the 1987 Section
20 Order, and the 1989 Section 20 Order, as modified by the Modification Order, including the Board's 10 percent revenue
limitation on such activities.
 For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall
Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in
the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities.



The Board also has previously approved, by order, the proposed private placement and riskless principal activities,
and Applicant has stated that it will conduct these proposed activities using the same methods and procedures and

The Board also has previously approved acting as originator, principal, broker or agent with respect to interest
rate and currency swaps, caps, floors, collars, and options on swaps, caps, floors and collars, including providing
advice to institutional customers regarding such financial instruments. 

See, e.g., The Sanwa Bank, Limited

The Fuji Bank, Limited

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 768 (1990); 

The Sumitomo Bank, Limited

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 582 (1989). Applicant proposes to engage in these swap activities subject to the provisions
and conditions established by the Board in its previous orders.
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by increasing customer convenience,
increasing competition in the market for the proposed services, and promoting gains in efficiency. Applicant believes
that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects.

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent </DOCTITLE>
Extension; Prograf

TM





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Prograf

TM

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
 
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Prograf

TM

. Prograf

TM

 (tacrolimus) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving allogeneic liver transplants.
Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application of Prograf

TM

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,894,366) from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested
FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated July
6, 1994, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Prograf

TM

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Prograf

TM

 is 1,290 days. Of this time, 1,033 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 257
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: September 28, 1990. The applicant claims April 2, 1990, as the date the Investigationl New Drug (IND) became effective.
The IND was received on March 30, 1990. It was placed on clinical hold April 26, 1990 and was removed from hold on September
28, 1990. Therefore, the IND effective date is September 28, 1990 (the date IND 34,654 was removed from hold). 
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 507 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: July 26, 1993 (NDA 50-708) and August 4, 1993, (NDA 50-709). The applicant claims July 23, 1993 (NDA 50-708)
and August 3, 1993 (NDA 50-709), as the dates the New Drug Applications (NDA's) for Prograf

TM

 were initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that the NDA's for Prograf

TM

 were submitted on July 26, 1993 (NDA 50-708) and August 4, 1993 (NDA 50-709).
 3. 

The date the application was approved

: April 8, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA's 50-708 and 50-709 were approved on April
8, 1994.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 448 days of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before November 7, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before March 6, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant
for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. 
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Certification for Exports; Revised Compliance Policy Guide; Availability</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised Compliance Policy Guide (CPG)
7150.01 entitled, ``Certification for Exports.'' Firms exporting products from the United States are often asked
by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply a certification relating to products subject to the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other acts that FDA administers. FDA has historically issued a number of different
types of such certificates, e.g., Certificates of Free Sale, Certificates for Export, Certificates to Foreign Governments,
and most recently the European Union Health Certificate for Fishery Products. With expanding world trade, ongoing
international harmonization initiatives, and developing international agreements, pressures on FDA to issue
more certificates for U.S. products are escalating. Therefore, FDA has revised the CPG to clarify that it is the responsibility
of the certificate requestor to provide information that will allow FDA to issue a Certificate for Export and to provide
guidance on the preparation of such certificates, including model forms. The revised guidance will improve agency
uniformity and consistency in providing export certifications for FDA-regulated commodities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This revised CPG describes current agency views on certificates requested by U. S. firms to facilitate the exports
of FDA regulated products to other countries. The agency recognizes the current importance of fulfilling requests
for export certificates, however, FDA's long-term policy is to work towards the reduction or elimination of export
certificates by finding other means to satisfy other countries' need for reassurance about imported products. The
new guide replaces CPG 7150.01 entitled ``Certificates of Free Sale'' that was issued in 1989.



The statements made in CPG 7150.01 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA or to create or confer any rights,
privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA guidance.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a new Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 7125.39
entitled ``Drugs Packaged for Infusion or Injection of Food-Producing Animals.'' This CPG provides policy and regulatory
action guidance to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) field and headquarters staff regarding the status of products
labeled for nonparenteral use in animals with packaging appropriate for parenteral use in food-producing animals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA had determined that a number of products are packaged in parenteral-like packaging although labeled for topical,
oral, or other route of administration. The policy states that oral and topical preparations for food-producing
animals should not be packaged to facilitate parenteral administration. FDA is concerned about safety of these unapproved
products when infused or injected into food-producing animals. Serious animal and human health consequences can
result from this practice. Products packaged as if for parenteral administration that do not bear adequate directions
for parenteral administration will be deemed misbranded.
 


The statements made in CPG 7125.39 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA, or to create or confer any
rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA
guidance.

Medicare Program; Criteria and Standards for Evaluating Intermediary and Carrier Performance During FY 1995 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 General notice with comment period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice describes the criteria and standards to be used for evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries
and carriers in the administration of the Medicare program beginning October 1, 1994. The results of these evaluations
are considered whenever HCFA enters into, renews, or terminates an intermediary agreement or carrier contract or
takes other contract actions (for example, assigning or reassigning providers of services to an intermediary or
designating regional or national intermediaries). 



This notice is published in accordance with sections 1816(f) and 1842(b)(2) of the Social Security Act. We are publishing
for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 those criteria and standards against which we evaluate intermediaries and carriers. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background 



Under section 1816 of the Social Security Act (the Act), public or private organizations and agencies participate
in the administration of Part A (Hospital Insurance) of the Medicare program under agreements with the Secretary
of Health and Human Services. These agencies or organizations, known as fiscal intermediaries, determine whether
medical services are covered under Medicare and determine correct payment amounts. The intermediaries then make
payments to the health care providers on behalf of the beneficiaries. Section 1816(f) of the Act requires us to develop
criteria, standards, and procedures to evaluate an intermediary's performance of its functions under its agreement.
We evaluate intermediary performance through the contract management process. 

Under section 1842 of the Act, we are authorized to enter into contracts with carriers to fulfill various functions
in the administration of Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries, physicians,
and suppliers of services submit claims to these carriers. The carriers determine whether the services are covered
under Medicare and the payable amount for the services or supplies and then make payment to the appropriate party.
Under section 1842(b)(2) of the Act, we are required to develop criteria, standards, and procedures to evaluate a
carrier's performance of its functions under its contract. We also evaluate carrier performance through the contract
management process. 

We are publishing the criteria and standards in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the public an opportunity to comment before implementation. In addition to the statutory requirement,
our regulations at 42 CFR 421.120 and 421.122 provide for publication of a 

Federal Register

 notice to announce criteria and standards for intermediaries prior to implementation. Regulations at 42 CFR 421.201
provide for publication of a 

Federal Register

 notice to announce criteria and standards for carriers prior to implementation. The current criteria and standards
were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51085). 

To the extent possible, we make every effort to publish the criteria and standards prior to the beginning of the Federal
fiscal year, which is October 1st.

If we do not publish a 

Federal Register

 notice before the new fiscal year begins, readers may presume that until and unless notified otherwise, the criteria
and standards which were in effect for the previous fiscal year remain in effect. 

In those instances where we are unable to meet our goal of publishing the subject 

Federal Register

 notice before the beginning of the fiscal year, we may publish the criteria and standards notice at any subsequent
time during the year. If we choose to publish a notice in this manner, the evaluation period for any such criteria and
standards which are the subject of the notice will be revised to be effective on the first day of the first month following
publication. Hence, any revised criteria and standards will measure performance prospectively; that is, we will
not apply new measurements to assess performance on a retroactive basis. 

Also, it is not our intention to revise the criteria and standards which will be used during the evaluation period once
this information has been published in a 

Federal Register

 notice. However, on occasion, either because of Administrative mandate or Congressional action, there may be a need
for changes which have direct impact upon the criteria and standards previously published, or which require the addition
of new criteria or standards, or that cause the deletion of previously published criteria and standards. Should such
changes be necessitated, we will issue a 

Federal Register

 notice prior to implementation of the changes. 

In all instances, necessary manual issuances will be published each year to ensure that the criteria and standards
are implemented uniformly and accurately. Also, as in previous years, the 

Federal Register

 notice will be republished and the effective date revised if changes are warranted as a result of the public comments
received on the criteria and standards. 



II. Incentive Payments to Carriers 



In accordance with section 1842(c)(1)(B) of the Act, this notice also describes the current methodology that will
be used to award incentive payments to carriers that successfully increase the proportion of physicians in the carrier's
service area who are participating physicians, or the proportion of payments to participating physicians. 

Section 1842(h) of the Act sets forth the Medicare participating physician program. ``Participating'' means accepting
assignment on all Medicare claims. ``Accepting assignment'' means physicians accept Medicare's approved amount
as full payment, with the beneficiary responsible for only the Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts. The
main goal of the program is to reduce the financial impact of medical costs upon beneficiaries by establishing incentives
for physicians to accept assignment on all Medicare claims. The provisions give all physicians an annual opportunity
to enroll or disenroll as a Medicare participating physician. 

Section 1842(b)(3)(H) of the Act requires Medicare carriers to implement programs to recruit and retain physicians
as participating physicians. These programs include educational and outreach activities and the use of professional
relations personnel to handle billing and other problems relating to payment of claims of participating physicians.
These programs are also designed to familiarize beneficiaries with the participating physician program and to assist
the beneficiaries in locating participating physicians. Carriers also increase participation through the use
of public relations, literature, and training in the physician community. We believe carriers continue to perform
these activities because they are advantageous to their operations. By properly educating the provider community,
carriers save staff time and produce cleaner claims which result in fewer inquiries as well as fewer exceptions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-2-00061 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Also, we believe that the implementation of the 
resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) fee schedule has 
contributed largely to the increase in the number of 
physicians participating in the Medicare program. 
Nonparticipation is discouraged by the ``limiting charges'' 
imposed under physician payment reform. 

We will continue to pay incentive bonuses to any 
carrier that achieves an increase of at least one-tenth of 
one percent in the participating physicians' rate or 
proportion of payments for participating physicians' 
services in the carrier's total service area. Carriers that 
achieve an increase in physicians' participation or payments 
for participating physician services of less than 2 
percentage points will be paid a partial incentive payment. 
Carriers that achieve an increase of at least 2 percentage 
points, but less than 4 points, will be paid the full 
incentive payment. Carriers that achieve an increase equal 
to or greater than 4 percentage points will be paid a bonus 
for each additional 2 percentage point increase over and 
above the initial 2 percentage point increase. 

As required by section 1842(c)(1)(B) of the Act, the 
amount of the total incentive payable to carriers is one 
percent of the total payments to carriers for claims 
processing costs for the fiscal year. The total incentive 
pool is calculated by summing the total claims processing 
costs reported by each carrier in fiscal year (FY) 1985 and 
multiplying the total by one percent. The total claims 
processing costs in that fiscal year amounted to $380 
million. Therefore, carrier bonuses in FY 1995 will be one 
percent of this amount or $3.8 million. Fiscal year 1985 
has been used as a base because it reflects the claims 
processing costs and workload at the inception of the 
participating physician program. 

For the purpose of determining each carrier's 
eligibility for an incentive payment, we make two 
comparisons. We compare the carrier's physician 
participation rate after the latest enrollment period with 
the physician participation rate after the prior enrollment 
date. We make a similar comparison of the proportion of 
covered charges for services by participating physicians 
during the quarter following the enrollment period with 
those of the quarter following the prior enrollment period. 
We intend to use whichever difference yields the higher 
percentage increase to determine eligibility for award of 
the incentive payment. Currently, we issue carrier 
incentive payments by September 30 following each annual 
enrollment period. The amount of these payments will be 
included in line 11 (other) of the carrier's Notice of 
Budget Approval, Form HCFA-1524. 



III. Criteria and Standards_General 



Basic tenets of the Medicare program are to pay claims 
promptly and accurately and to foster good beneficiary and 
provider relations. Contractors must administer the 
Medicare program efficiently and economically. We have 
developed a contractor management program for FY 1995 that 
sets expectations for the contractor; measures the 
performance of the contractor; evaluates the performance 
against the expectations; and, takes appropriate contract 
action based upon evaluation of the contractor's 
performance. The goal of performance evaluation is to 
ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations. 
We measure contractor performance to ensure that the 
following objectives are met: contractors do what is 
required of them by law, regulation and HCFA directive; do 
it well; and continually improve what they do. We have 
restructured contractor evaluation into five criteria, 
designed to meet those objectives. This restructuring 
effort considered comments from HCFA components as well as 
beneficiary and provider groups which have commented on past 


Federal Register

 notifications.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-2-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The first criterion in the FY 1995 contractor 
performance evaluation is ``Claims Processing'', which 
measures contractual performance against claims processing 
accuracy and timeliness requirements. Within the Claims 
Processing criterion, we have identified those performance 
standards which are mandated by either legislation, 
regulation or judicial decision. These standards include 
claims processing timeliness, the rate of cases reversed by 
an Administrative Law Judge, the timeliness of intermediary 
reconsideration cases, and the accuracy and timeliness of 
carrier reviews and hearings. Further evaluation in the 
Claims Processing criterion may include, but is not limited 
to, the accuracy of bill and claims processing, the level of 
electronic claims payment, and the accuracy of intermediary 
reconsideration cases. 

The second criterion is ``Customer Service'', which 
assesses the completeness of the service provided to 
customers by the contractor in its administration of the 
Medicare program. Mandated standards in the Customer 
Service criterion include the accuracy of Explanations of 
Medicare Benefits, and the accuracy and timeliness of 
carrier replies to beneficiary telephone inquiries. In FY 
1995, customer feedback may be used to collect comparable 
data on customer satisfaction and identify areas in need of 
improvement. Among the specific contractor services that 
may be included in the evaluation process under the Customer 
Service criterion are: beneficiary relations; provider 
education; appropriate telephone inquiry responses; and the 
tone and accuracy of all correspondence. 

The third criterion is ``Payment Safeguards'', which 
evaluates whether the Medicare trust fund is safeguarded 
against inappropriate program expenditures. Intermediary 
and carrier performance may be evaluated in the areas of 
medical review, Medicare secondary payer, fraud and abuse, 
and audit and reimbursement. Mandated performance standards 
in the Payment Safeguards criterion are the accuracy of 
decisions on skilled nursing facility (SNF) demand bills, 
and the timeliness of processing Tax Equity and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act (TEFRA) target rate adjustments, 
exceptions, and exemptions. Further evaluation in this 
criterion may include, but is not limited to, the efficient 
and effective compilation and analysis of data to bring 
about continuous improvement in contractor efforts to 
safeguard Medicare program dollars. 

The fourth criterion is ``Fiscal Responsibility'', which 
evaluates the contractor's efforts to protect the Medicare 
program and the public interest. Contractors must 
effectively manage Federal funds for both payment of 
benefits and cost of administration under the Medicare 
program. Proper financial and budgetary controls must be in 
place to ensure contractor compliance with its agreement 
with HHS and HCFA. Additional functions reviewed under this 
criterion may include, but are not limited to, bottom line 
unit cost, compliance with the Budget and Performance 
Requirements, adherence to Chief Financial Officer's Act. 

The fifth and final criterion is ``Administrative 
Activities'', which measures a contractor's administrative 
management of the Medicare program. A contractor must 
efficiently and effectively manage its operations to assure 
constant improvement in the way it does business. Proper 
systems security, ADP maintenance, and disaster recovery 
plans must be in place. A contractor's evaluation under the 
Administrative Activities criterion may include, but is not 
limited to, establishment, application, documentation, and 
effectiveness of internal controls. Internal controls 
include all aspects of a contractor's operation. It can 
include implementation reviews of corrective action plans, 
task management plans, data and reporting requirements, and 
management improvement plans. 

We have also developed separate measures for evaluating 
unique activities of Regional Home Health Intermediaries 
(RHHIs).

Section 1816(e)(4) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
designate regional agencies or organizations, which are 
already Medicare intermediaries under section 1816, to 
perform bill processing functions with respect to 
freestanding home health agency (HHA) bills. The law 
requires that we limit the number of such regional 
intermediaries (i.e., RHHIs) to not more than ten; there are 
currently nine (see 42 CFR 421.117 and the 

Federal Register

 
published on May 19, 1988 (53 FR 17936) for more details 
about the RHHIs). 

In addition, section 1816(e)(4) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to develop criteria and standards in order to 
determine whether to designate an agency or organization to 
perform services with respect to hospital affiliated HHAs. 
We have developed separate measures for RHHIs in order to 
evaluate the distinct RHHI functions. These functions 
include the processing of freestanding HHA, hospital 
affiliated HHA, and hospice bills. Through an evaluation 
using these criteria and standards we may determine whether 
the RHHI functions should be moved from one intermediary to 
another in order to ensure effective and efficient 
administration of the program benefit. 

Below we list the criteria and standards to be used for 
evaluating the performance of intermediaries and carriers. 
In a number of instances, we identify a HCFA manual as a 
source of more detailed requirements. Intermediaries and 
carriers have copies of the various Medicare manuals 
referenced in this notice. Members of the public also have 
access to our manualized instructions. 

Medicare manuals are available for review at local 
Federal Depository Libraries (FDLs). Under the FDL Program, 
government publications are sent to approximately 1400 
designated libraries throughout the United States. 
Interested parties may examine the documents at any one of 
the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material 
to a local library not designated as an FDL. To locate the 
nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library. 

In addition, individuals may contact regional 
depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one 
copy of nearly every Federal government publication, either 
in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. 
These libraries provide reference services and interlibrary 
loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may 
obtain information about the location of the nearest 
regional depository library from any library. 

Finally, all HCFA regional offices maintain all 
Medicare manuals for public inspection. To find the 
location of the nearest available HCFA regional office, 
individuals may contact the individual listed at the 
beginning of this notice. That individual can also provide 
information about purchasing or subscribing to the various 
Medicare manuals. 



IV. Criteria and Standards for Intermediaries 



Claims Processing Criterion 




The Claims Processing criterion contains 4 mandated 
standards. 



Standard 1

_95% of clean electronically submitted non-Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) bills paid within statutorily 
specified time frames. Specifically, clean, non-PIP 
electronic claims can be paid as early as the 14th day (13 
days after the date of receipt) and must be paid by the 31st 
day (30 days after the date of receipt). 



Standard 2

_95% of clean paper non-PIP bills paid within 
specified time frames. Specifically, clean, non-PIP paper 
claims can be paid as early as the 27th day (26 days after 
the date of receipt), and must be paid by the 31st day (30 
days after the date of receipt). 



Standard 3

_Reversal rate by Administrative Law Judges 
(ALJ) is at or below 5.0%. 



Standard 4

_75% of reconsiderations are processed within 60 
days and 90% are processed within 90 days.

Additional functions may be evaluated under this 
criterion. These functions include, but are not limited to: 

 Accurate Bill Processing; 

 Attainment of Electronic Media Claims goals; 

 Accurate processing of reconsideration cases with 
clear responses and appropriate customer-friendly 
tone and clarity; 

 Management of shared processing sub-contract; 

 Relationship with Common Working File Host; 

 Data analysis and validation. 



Customer Satisfaction Criterion 



We may review the intermediary's efforts to enhance 
customer satisfaction through the use of customer feedback. 
Results of the feedback may be used to establish comparable 
data on customer satisfaction and to identify areas in need 
of improvement. The results may be summarized for 
publication in the report of contractor performance and 
shared with individual contractors. 

We may also evaluate, but are not limited to, the 
following functions: 

 The accuracy, timeliness and appropriateness of 
responses to telephone inquiries; 

 The accuracy, clearness and timeliness of 
responses to written inquiries with appropriate 
customer-friendly tone and clarity; 

 Relationships with professional and beneficiary 
organizations and use of focus groups; 

 Educational and outreach efforts. 



Payment Safeguards Criterion 



The Payment Safeguard criterion contains 2 mandated 
standards. 



Standard 1

_Decisions of SNF demand bills are accurate. 



Standard 2

_TEFRA target rate adjustments, exceptions, and 
exemptions are processed within mandated timeframes. 

Additional functions may be evaluated under this 
criterion. These functions include, but are not limited to: 

 Medical Review: We may assess the ability of the Medicare contractors to apply their analytical 
skills and focus resources on particular providers 
or claim types which represent unnecessary or 
inappropriate care. We may review contractor 
efforts in developing local and national data that 
identify aberrancies and form the basis of 
corrective actions, such as educating the 
provider, and/or become the basis of medical 
review policies or review screens as directed by 
the Medicare Intermediary Manual (MIM)  3939 and 
Budget and Performance Requirements. We may also 
review the effectiveness of the contractor's 
identification and corrective action. We may also 
review a sample of a contractor's medical review 
decisions to assure that the decisions comply with 
current coverage guidelines and that the 
contractor's use of each medical review screen is 
supported by sufficient documentation. We may 
assess contractors' medical review efforts at 
developing effective means of addressing 
aberrancies identified during the analysis of all 
local and national data, and take action to assure 
that the focused medical review procedures and 
systems designed and utilized by the contractor 
have allowed it to meet program requirements. We 
may also review a contractor's efforts to review 
information or documentation located in the fraud 
unit. 

 Audit and Reimbursement: We may assess the quality 
of fiscal intermediaries' activities in the audit 
and settlement of Medicare cost reports. We may 
assess the timeliness of Medicare cost report 
settlements and the accuracy by which fiscal 
intermediaries have established interim provider 
payments. 

 Medicare Secondary Payer: The Medicare Secondary 
Payer (MSP) program may use the MSP review guide 
to review the intermediary's MSP processes in 
administering the program and for identifying and 
recovering mistaken Medicare payments in 
accordance with MIM, Part 3,   3400ff and 3600ff, 
and pertinent HCFA instructions and transmittals. We may develop outcome measures to assess the 
intermediary's accuracy in reporting savings and 
to determine if claim development procedures are 
followed. We may also evaluate the accuracy and 
timeliness of claims payment and determine if the 
Common Working File, internal systems and required 
software are utilized as prescribed. We may also 
evaluate the contractor's ability to prioritize 
and process recoveries in compliance with 
instructions, determine if recoveries of all 
payers are processed equally, and ensure that 
audit trail documentation exists. 

 Fraud and Abuse: The Fraud and Abuse program may 
use the formally established mechanism to review 
the intermediaries in the basic level of fraud 
detection, deterrence and development as described 
in MIM, Part 3,  3950ff, and pertinent HCFA 
instructions and transmittals. We may assess the 
ability of the contractor to identify fraud cases 
that exist within its service area, and to take 
appropriate action to dispose of these cases. We 
may review the contractor's efforts in 
investigating allegations of fraud made by 
beneficiaries, providers, HCFA, OIG, and other 
sources. We may develop an outcome measure to 
assess the contractor's ability to put in place an 
effective fraud detection and deterrence program. 



Fiscal Responsibility Criterion 



We may review the intermediary's efforts to establish 
and maintain appropriate financial and budgetary internal 
controls over benefit payments and administrative costs. 
Proper internal controls must be in place to ensure that 
contractors comply with their agreements with HCFA. 

Additional matters to be reviewed under the Fiscal 
Responsibility criterion may include, but are not limited 
to: 

 Bottom line unit cost; 

 Compliance with the Budget and Performance 
Requirements;

<TEXT>
 

 Adherence to Chief Financial Officer's Act; 
 Overall control of administrative cost and benefit 
payments. 




Administrative Activities Criterion 





We may measure a contractor's administrative ability to 
manage the Medicare program. We may address the efficiency 
and effectiveness of their operation, their system of 
internal controls and the compliance with HCFA directives 
and initiatives. A contractor's evaluation under the 
Administrative Activities criterion may include, but is not 
limited to, implementation reviews of: 


 Proper systems security; 
 ADP maintenance; 
 Disaster recovery plan; 
 Corrective action plans; 
 Task management plans; 
 Data and reporting requirements; 
 Management improvement plans.

Payment Safeguards Criterion 





Carrier functions that may be reviewed under this 
criterion include, but are not limited to: 

 Medical Review: We may assess the ability of the Medicare contractors to apply their analytical 
skills and focus resources on particular providers 
or claim types which represent unnecessary or 
inappropriate care. We may review contractor 
efforts in developing effective means of 
addressing aberrancies identified through 
analyzing data to target prepay and postpay 
review. This forms the basis of corrective 
actions such as educating the provider and/or 
become the basis of medical review policies or 
review screens as directed by the carrier manual 
and Budget and Performance Requirements. We may 
also review a sample of the contractor's use of 
medical coverage guidelines to determine if the 
contractor's use of each medical review screen is 
supported by sufficient documentation. We may 
assess the effectiveness of contractors' medical 
review efforts at developing means of addressing 
aberrancies identified during the analysis of all 
local and national data and take action to assure 
that the focused medical review procedures and 
systems designed and utilized by the contractor 
have allowed it to meet program requirements. We 
may also review a contractor's efforts to review 
information or documentation located in the fraud 
unit. 


 Medicare Secondary Payer: The Medicare Secondary 
Payer (MSP) program may use the MSP review guide 
to review the carrier's MSP processes in 
administering the program and for identifying and 
recovering mistaken Medicare payments in 
accordance with the Medicare Carrier Manual (MCM), 
Part 3,   3375, 4306.3, and 4307-4308.1, and 
pertinent HCFA instructions and transmittals. 
We may develop outcome measures to assess the 
carrier's accuracy in reporting savings and to 
determine if claim development procedures are 
followed. We may also evaluate the accuracy and 
timeliness of claims payment and determine if the 
Common Working File, internal systems and required 
software are utilized as prescribed. We may also 
evaluate the contractor's ability to prioritize 
and process recoveries in compliance with 
instructions, determine if recoveries of all 
payers are processed equally, and ensure that 
audit trail documentation exists. 


 Fraud and Abuse: The Fraud and Abuse program may 
use the formally established mechanism to review 
the carriers in the basic level of fraud 
detection, deterrence and development as described 
in MCM, Part 3,  14000ff, and pertinent HCFA 
issued instructions and transmittals. We may 
assess the ability of the contractor to identify 
fraud cases that exist within its service area, 
and to take appropriate action to dispose of these 
cases. We may review the contractor's efforts in 
investigating allegations of fraud made by 
beneficiaries, providers, HCFA, OIG, and other 
sources. We may develop an outcome measure to 
assess the contractor's ability to put in place an 
effective fraud detection and deterrence program. 





Fiscal Responsibility Criterion 





We may review the carrier's efforts to establish and 
maintain appropriate financial and budgetary internal 
controls over benefit payments and administrative costs. 
Proper internal controls must be in place to ensure that 
contractors comply with their agreements with HCFA. 



Additional matters to be reviewed under the Fiscal 
Responsibility criterion may include, but are not limited 
to: 

 Bottom line unit cost; 
 Compliance with the Budget and Performance 
Requirements; 
 Adherence to Chief Financial Officer's Act; 
 Overall control of administrative cost and benefit 
payments. 




Administrative Activities Criterion

VI. Regional Home Health Intermediaries (RHHIs) Criterion 



The following standards are mandated for the Regional 
Home Health Intermediaries criterion: 



Standard 1

_95% of clean electronically submitted non-PIP 
HHA/hospice bills paid within statutorily specified time 
frames. Specifically, clean, non-PIP electronic claims can 
be paid as early as the 14th day (13 days after the date of 
receipt) and must be paid by the 31st day (30 days after the 
date of receipt). 



Standard 2

_95% of clean paper non-PIP HHA/hospice bills 
paid within specified time frames. Specifically, clean, 
non-PIP paper claims can be paid as early as the 27th day 
(26 days after the date of receipt) and must be paid by the 
31st day (30 days after the date of receipt). 



Standard 3

_75% of HHA/hospice reconsiderations are 
processed within 60 days and 90% are processed within 90 
days. 

We may use this criterion to review a RHHI's 
performance with respect to handling the HHA/hospice 
workload. This includes processing HHA/hospice bills timely 
and accurately, properly paying and settling HHA cost 
reports, and timely and accurately processing 
reconsiderations from beneficiaries, HHAs, and hospices. 



VII. Action Based on Performance Evaluations 



A contractor's performance is evaluated against 
applicable program requirements for each criterion. Each 
contractor must certify that all information submitted to 
HCFA relating to contractor management process, including 
without limitation all records, reports, files, papers and 
other information, whether in written, electronic, or other 
form, is accurate and complete to the best of the 
contractor's knowledge and belief. A contractor will also 
be required to certify that its files, records, documents, 
and data have not been manipulated or falsified in an effort 
to receive a more favorable performance evaluation. A 
contractor must further certify that, to the best of its 
knowledge and belief, the contractor has submitted, without 
withholding any relevant information, all information 
required to be submitted with respect to the contractor 
management process under the authority of applicable law(s), 
regulation(s), contracts, or HCFA manual provision(s). Any 
contractor that makes a false, fictitious, or fraudulent 
certification may be subject to criminal and/or civil 
prosecution, as well as appropriate administrative action. 
Such administrative action may include debarment or 
suspension of the contractor, as well as the termination or 
nonrenewal of a contract.

<TEXT>
 

If a contractor meets the level of performance required 
by operational instructions, it meets the requirements of 
that criterion. Any performance measured below basic 
operational expectations constitutes a deficiency. The 
contractor may be required to develop and implement a 
corrective action plan when performance problems are 
identified. The contractor will be monitored to assure 
effective and efficient compliance with the corrective 
action plan and improved performance where requirements are 
not met. 

The results of performance evaluations and assessments 
under all five criteria will be used for contract management 
activities and will be published in the contractor's annual 
performance report. We may initiate administrative actions 
as a result of the evaluation of contractor performance 
based on these performance criteria. Under sections 1816 
and 1842 of the Act, we consider the results of the 
evaluation in our determinations on: 

 Entering into, renewing, or terminating agreements or 
contracts with contractors. 
 Decisions concerning other contract actions for 
intermediaries and carriers (such as deletion of an 
automatic renewal clause). These decisions are made on 
a case-by-case basis and depend primarily on the nature 
and degree of performance. More specifically, they 
depend on:

 


+ Relative overall performance compared to other 
contractors; 
+ Number of criteria in which deficient performance 
occurs; 
+ Extent of each deficiency; 
+ Relative significance of the requirement for which 
deficient performance occurs within the overall 
evaluation program; and 
+ Efforts to improve program quality, service, and 
efficiency.

 


 Decisions concerning the assignment or reassignment of 
providers and designation of regional or national 
intermediaries for classes of providers. 

We make individual contract action decisions after 
considering these factors in terms of their relative 
significance and impact on the effective and efficient 
administration of the Medicare program. 

In addition, if the cost incurred by the intermediary 
or carrier to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the 
amount which the Secretary finds to be reasonable and 
adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an 
efficiently and economically operated intermediary or 
carrier, such high costs may also be grounds for adverse 
action. 



VIII. Response to Public Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence 
we normally receive on 

Federal Register

 documents published 
for comment, we are unable to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all comments we receive by 
the date and time specified in the 

DATES

 section of this 
preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we 
will respond to the comments in the preamble of that 
document. 

In accordance with Executive Order 12866, this notice 
has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and 
Budget.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), New Mexico State Office, announces the availability to the public of the Environmental
Assessment (EA) and Decision Record (DR) for Six Coal Lease Applications and One Application for Coal Lease Modification
in the Southeast Oklahoma Coal Leasing Area (LeFlore and Lattimer counties, Oklahoma). This EA analyzes the potential
impacts on the environment of five alternatives, including the no action alternative, for issuing the six coal leases
and modifying an existing lease to avoid bypassing federal coal reserves. On June 29, 1994, a public meeting was held
in Poteau, Oklahoma to solicit comments on the EA and to obtain public input on BLM's determination of fair market value
and maximum economic recovery of the coal. No comments were received on the adequacy of the EA and no public input indicated
opposition to the proposed leasing.



The Bureau of Land Management, in cooperation with the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) has selected Alternative B,
the Sale of Revised Tracts to Mine by Pass Coal and also the agency's preferred alternative, for implementation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Any person adversely affected by this decision may appeal such action to the Interior Board of Land Appeals pursuant
to 43 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 4. An appeal must be filed in the office of the State Director, Bureau of
Land Management, New Mexico State Office, P.O. Box 27115, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87502-0115, within 30 days of
the publication of this Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

The purpose of the withdrawals is to protect recreation areas, roadside zones, and administrative sites. The withdrawals
segregate the land from location and entry under the mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws, and in some instances,
also segregates the land from settlement, sale, location, and entry. No change is proposed in the purpose or segregative
effect of the withdrawals.

For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection
with the proposed withdrawal continuations may present their views in writing to the Chief, Branch of Lands and Minerals
Operations, in the Utah State Office.

The authorized office of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine
the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will be prepared for consideration by the
Secretary of the Interior, the President, and Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawals will be
continued, and, if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawals will be published
in the 

Federal Register

. The existing withdrawals will continue until such final determination is made.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Draft Revised Recovery Plan for the Sonoran Pronghorn for Review and Comment </DOCTITLE>

ACTION:

 Notice of document availability and public comment period.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft revised recovery
plan for the Sonoran pronghorn (

Antilocapra americana sonoriensis

) which the Service listed as an endangered species on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). This animal's population is estimated
to be less than 800 animals; less than 300 in the United States and no more than 500 in the State of Sonora, Mexico. Distribution
is limited primarily to Sonoran desert habitats. Factors that limit population growth are not well understood. However,
loss of habitat due to drying of extended reaches of the Gila and Sonoyta Rivers, competition from domestic livestock,
and human encroachment are believed to be limiting factors. Illegal hunting and predation on fawns may also limit
growth of some populations. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point that it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site-specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal
agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. 
Sonoran pronghorn habitat in the United States consists of broad alluvial valleys separated by blocked-faulted
mountains. Creosote and white bursage are the dominate vegetation in these valleys. Sonoran pronghorn are found
in the creosote-bursage plant association throughout the year, but utilize areas containing palo verde-mixed cacti
plant associations during spring and summer months. The requirement of water for drinking has not been verified.
In Mexico, Sonoran pronghorn are found in areas where permanent water is not available, and there is no evidence of
them traveling long distances to obtain water. The Recovery Plan has been revised to include research results obtained
since the original recovery plan was completed in 1982 and to reflect recovery objectives that reflect current information
known about the species. 
The Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery Plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in the Southwest Region. The
plan will be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment
period. 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan. 


Authority 


The Authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Labor Surplus Area Classification Under Executive Orders 12073 and 10582; Notice of Addition to the Annual List of
Labor Surplus Areas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to announce an addition to the annual list of labor surplus areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12073 requires executive agencies to emphasize procurement set-asides in labor surplus areas.
The Secretary of Labor is responsible under that Order for classifying and designating areas as labor surplus areas.
Executive agencies should refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 20 (48 CFR Part 20) in order to assess the impact
of the labor surplus area program on particular procurements.



Under Executive Order 10582 executive agencies may reject bids or offers of foreign materials in favor of the lowest
offer by a domestic supplier, provided that the domestic supplier undertakes to produce substantially all of the
materials in areas of substantial unemployment as defined by the Secretary of Labor. The preference given to domestic
suppliers under Executive Order 10582 has been modified by Executive Order 12260. Federal Acquisition Regulation
Part 25 (48 CFR Part 25) implements Executive Order 12260. Executive agencies should refer to Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 25 in procurements involving foreign businesses or products in order to assess its impact on the particular
procurements.

The Department of Labor regulations implementing Executive Orders 12073 and 10582 are set forth at 20 CFR part 654,
subparts A and B. Subpart A requires the Assistant Secretary of Labor to classify jurisdictions as labor surplus areas
pursuant to the criteria specified in the regulations and to publish annually a list of labor surplus areas. Pursuant
to those regulations the Assistant Secretary of Labor published the annual list of labor surplus areas on October
19, 1993, (58 FR 53943).

Subpart B of Part 654 states that an area of substantial unemployment for purposes of Executive Order 10582 is any area
classified as a labor surplus area under Subpart A. Thus, labor surplus areas under Executive Order 12073 are also
areas of substantial unemployment under Executive Order 10582.

The area described below has been classified by the Assistant Secretary as a labor surplus area pursuant to 20 CFR 654.5(b)(48
FR 15615 April 12, 1983) and is effective September 1, 1994.

The list of labor surplus areas is published for the use of all Federal agencies in directing procurement activities
and locating new plants or facilities.

<DOCTITLE>Petitions for Modification </DOCTITLE>


The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 


1. C & C Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-124-C] 


C & C Coal Company, 100 E. Main Street, Ashland, Pennsylvania 17921 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1100-2(a)(2) (quantity and location of firefighting equipment) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No.
36-08341) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers
to replace existing requirements where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard. 


2. C & C Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-125-C] 


C & C Coal Company, 100 E. Main Street, Ashland, Pennsylvania 17921 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1200(i) (mine map) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36-08341) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.
The petitioner proposes to limit the mapping of mines above and below 
mine workings to those present within 100 foot of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other
veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would
provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


3. C & C Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-126-C] 


C & C Coal Company, 100 E. Main Street, Ashland, Pennsylvania 17921 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1202-1(a) (temporary notations, revisions, and supplements) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36-08341)
located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to revise and supplement mine maps on an annual
basis instead of the required 6 month interval and to update maps daily by hand notations. The petitioner asserts that
the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



4. Betty B. Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-127-C] 


Betty B. Coal Company, P.O. Box 1139, Coeburn, Virginia 24230 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.1710 (canopies or cabs; electric face equipment) to its 
Betty B. Mine No. 12 (I.D. No. 44-06423) located in Wise County, Virginia. The petitioner requests relief from
the use of canopies on electric face equipment. The petitioner states that the use of canopies would result in hazardous
conditions to the equipment operator. 


5. L. L. & S. Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-128-C] 


L. L. & S. Coal Company, P.O. Box 148, Hegins, Pennsylvania 17938 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its L. L. & S. Mine (I.D. No. 36-08166) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. Because of steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage
slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternate,
when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor
and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the
main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same
measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


6. Consolidation Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-129-C] 


Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its Robinson Run No. 95 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01318)
located in Harrison County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions from the No. 5 Seal in the Main
East set of seals to the point of intersection with Main North of the intake air course, traveling the affected area
in its entirety would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation check points; to have a certified
person test for methane and the quantity of air at each check point on a weekly basis; to have the certified person initial,
date, and record the results in a record book kept on the surface; and to make the record book available for inspection
by interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same
measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Martinka Coal Company, 800 Laidley Tower, P.O. Box 1233, Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Tygart River Mine (I.D. No. 46-03805) located
in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating conditions in certain areas of the return air course, traveling
the affected area in its entirety would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish five evaluation check points;
to have a certified person monitor for hazardous conditions, the volume and direction of airflow, and the methane
and oxygen concentrations in the affected area at each check point on a weekly basis; to record the results in a manner
similar to that required by the mandatory standard; and to locate a date board at each evaluation point which the examiner
would initial and record the date and time of the examination. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


8. Monterey Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-131-C] 


Monterey Coal Company, Rural Route 4, Box 235, Carlinville, Illinois 62626 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 11-00726) located
in Macoupin County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes to use two Fletcher Model CDR-15 slim line roofbolters
near the end of the longwall panel to provide additional support of the face in preparation for equipment transfer
to the next panel. These bolters would be equipped with No. 2 AWG G-GC portable cables with 1200 feet of the cable
reaching across the face from the power center outby. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method
would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


9. Consolidation Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-132-C] 


Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002 (trolley wires and trolley feeder wires, high-voltage cables and transformers)
to its Shoemaker Mine (I.D. No. 46-01436) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes
to use high-voltage (4,160 volts) cables inby the last open crosscut to supply power to longwall equipment. The petitioner
states that application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard. 


10. Eastern Associated Coal Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-133-C and M-94-134-C] 


Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, 800 Laidley Tower, P.O. Box 1233, Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed
a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its Lightfoot
No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 46-04332) and its Lightfoot No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46-04955) both located in Boone County,
West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to use a threaded ring and a spring loaded device on battery plug connectors
for mobile battery-powered machines to prevent the plug connector from accidently disengaging while under load
instead of using a padlock. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the
same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


11. K & S Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-135-C] 


K & S Coal Company, RD 

#

2, Box 145, Hegins, Pennsylvania 17938 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.332(b)(1) and (b)(2)
(working sections and working places) to its First Chance Slope (I.D. No. 36-07629) located in Schuylkill County,
Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use air passing through inaccessible abandoned workings and additional
areas by mixing with the air in the intake haulage slope to ventilate the only active working section, to ensure air
quality by sampling intake air during preshift and on-shift examinations, and to suspend mine production when air
quality fails to meet specified criteria. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide
at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Louisiana Energy Services, L.P.; Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Claiborne Enrichment
Center, Homer, LA



Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has published a Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) (NUREG-1484) regarding the proposed construction and operation of the Claiborne
Enrichment Center to be located near Homer, Louisiana. The FEIS describes and evaluates the potential environmental
consequences of granting Louisiana Energy Services, L.P. (LES) a license to construct and operate a uranium enrichment
facility. The facility would use the gaseous centrifuge enrichment process. Natural uranium hexafluoride would
be used as the feed material, the product would be uranium hexafluoride enriched up to 5 percent in the isotope uranium-235.
The FEIS concludes that adverse impacts associated with construction and operation of the facility are small and
acceptable and are outweighed by the substantial socioeconomic benefits associated with plant construction and
operation. The FEIS also documents the NRC Staff response to comments received on the Draft Environmental Impact
Statement.

The FEIS is available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street NW, Washington, DC and the Local Public Document Room at the Claiborne Parish Library, 901 Edgewood Drive,
Homer, Louisiana.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units Nos. 1, 2, and 3; Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I


Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51,
and NPF-74, which authorizes operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 (Palo
Verde), respectively. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and
Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The Palo Verde facilities
consist of three pressurized reactors located in Maricopa County, 50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona.


II



Paragraph (a) of  73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage,'' of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) states, in part, that ``the
licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will
have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical
to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''

Paragraph (1) of  73.55(d), ``Access Requirement,'' specifies that ``The licensee shall control all points
of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Section 73.55(d)(5) requires that ``A numbered picture
badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without
escort.'' Section 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may
be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance
into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area . . . .''
The licensee proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badge with them when departing the site.

An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated April 29, 1994, the licensee requested an
exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.



III


Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are (1) authorized by law and will not
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and (2) are otherwise in the public interest.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection
against radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have ``the same
high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall
level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would
be provided by the regulation. 

Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the Palo Verde units is controlled through the use of a photograph
on a badge/keycard (hereafter, referred to as badge). The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph
on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The individual is then given the badge to allow
access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access
are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exist location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are
retrievable at each entrance/exist location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are
not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plants' physical security plans, neither licensee employees
nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite. 

Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have
the physical characteristics of his/her hand (hand geometry) registered with his/her badge number in the access
control computer. Access is then controlled by the individual requesting access placing his/her badge into the card
reader and his/her hand on a measuring surface, the computer then compares the hand geometry to the registered badge
number. If the characteristics of the hand geometry stored in the computer match the badge number, access is granted.
If the characteristics do not match, access is denied. This provides a nontransferable means of identifying that
the individual possessing the badge is the individual who was granted unescorted access. It also provides a positive
means of assuring that a stolen or lost badge could not be used to gain access, thus eliminating the need to issue and
retrieve the badges while maintaining the same high level of assurance that access is granted to only authorized individuals.
All other access processes, including search function capability, would remain the same. The system will not be used
for persons requiring escorted access (i.e., visitors). The access process will continue to be under the observation
of security personnel located within a hardened cubicle who have final control over the release of the entrance station
turnstiles. A numbered picture badge identification system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized
access to the protected area with escorts. Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the
protected area. 

The licensee will use the hand geometry equipment which will meet the detection probability of 90 percent with a 95
percent confidence level. Testing evaluated by Sandia National Laboratory (Sandia report entitled ``A Performance
Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices,'' SAND91-0276 UC-906 Unlimited Release, Printed
June 1991), demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system is capable of meeting the proposed detection probability
and confidence level. Based upon the results of the Sandia report and on its experience with the current photo-identification
system, the proposed system will have a false acceptance rate less than the current system. The Physical Security
Plans for the site will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system
and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their badges offsite. 



IV 



For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. 

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Arizona Public Service Company an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5)
relating to the returning of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by
the licensee, i.e., contractors, who are authorized unescorted access into the protected area, can take their badges
offsite. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 41519). 

This exemption is effective upon issuance. 

 


For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<DOCTITLE>North Atlantic Energy Service Corp. (Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1); Order for Modification of Order Approving Transfer
of License</DOCTITLE>



I



Great Bay Power Corporation (Great Bay), formerly EUA Power Corporation, is the owner of a 12.1324 percent share of
Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1 (Seabrook). Great Bay's interest in Seabrook is governed by License No. NPF-86
issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), pursuant to part 50 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(10 CFR part 50), on March 15, 1990, in Docket No. 50-443. Under this license, only North Atlantic Energy Service
Corporation (North Atlantic), acting as agent and representative of the 11 joint owners listed in the license, has
the authority to operate Seabrook. Seabrook is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.



II



The transfer of any right under License No. NPF-86 is subject to NRC approval pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80(a). By letter
of May 14, 1993, from its counsel, Ropes & Gray, North Atlantic filed two requests with the NRC. In one, it requested
NRC approval of the indirect transfer of control of EUA Power Corporation's 12.1324 percent ownership in Seabrook.
In the other, it requested an amendment to the Operating License to reflect EUA Power Corporation's change of name
to Great Bay Power Corporation. The name of EUA Power Corporation was formally changed to Great Bay Power Corporation
in February 1993 following the redemption of all outstanding stock in EUA Power Corporation from its corporate parent,
Eastern Utility Associates. Following the redemption of its outstanding stock, EUA Power Corporation was no longer
a subsidiary of Eastern Utility Associates, and the name was changed to remove any implication of a continuing relationship
with its former corporate parent. The name change did not affect the corporate entity of the debtor in bankruptcy.
An indirect transfer of ownership occurs with the elimination of the existing stock of the debtor (Great Bay) and the
issuance of new stock to others. On August 16, 1993, the NRC issued Amendment 23 to License No. NPF-86 that incorporated
the name change of EUA Power Corporation to Great Bay Power Corporation in the footnote to page 1 of the operating license
and issued an order approving the indirect transfer of the ownership interest of EUA Power Corporation. The order
was contingent on the transfer of control being completed no later than February 15, 1994, and included the provision
that upon application and showing of good cause, the order may be extended for a short period beyond February 15, 1994.

On February 3, 1994, North Atlantic, through its counsel Ropes & Gray, filed an application requesting extension
of the Order until June 30, 1994, and identified the reasons why the transfer of control could not be completed by February
15, 1994. In that application, North Atlantic asserted that the sole obstacle to final implementation of the Plan
of Reorganization was the difficulty with completing the contemplated $45 million credit facility for the source
of funds to cover Great Bay's cash requirements. In lieu of this credit facility, the debtor's bondholders (Bondholders)
entered into an agreement in principle with Omega Advisors that provided for an investment of $35 million by Omega
Advisors in exchange for 60 percent equity in Great Bay. This agreement, reached on February 2, 1994, was a modification
to the Plan of Reorganization and additional time was required to formalize the agreement, recirculate a revised
Disclosure Statement to the creditors, and obtain reconfirmation of the revised Plan of Reorganization from the
Bankruptcy Court.

On February 15, 1994, the NRC issued an Order which modified the August 16, 1993, Order Approving Transfer of License
by extending the expiration date to June 30, 1994. On April 7, 1994, a Stock Subscription Agreement was entered into
with Omega Advisors and Elliot Associates, L.P.
 (the Investors), and a revised Disclosure Statement was circulated to all creditors. The Revised Plan of Reorganization
was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on May 23, 1994, and a closing of the transaction was scheduled for June 15, 1994.
However, on June 11, 1994 the Investors notified Great Bay that unanticipated events delaying the completion of the
Seabrook third refueling outage from early June 1994 until early August 1994 could affect adversely Great Bay's financial
projections, and therefore the delay constituted a material adverse change in Great Bay's financial condition.
The Investors requested postponement of the scheduled closing while independent financial and engineering consultants
retained by the Investors assessed the impact of these events. However, these evaluations could not be available
by June 30, 1994, leading North Atlantic to request, through its counsel Ropes & Gray, on June 27, 1994, a second
extension of the Order until August 31, 1994. On June 30, 1994, the NRC issued an Order which modified the August 16,
1993, Order Approving Transfer of License by extending the expiration date to August 31, 1994.





North Atlantic (Ropes & Gray letter of August 17, 1994) now has advised the NRC that Great Bay and the Investors
have nearly resolved their differences and have agreed tentatively to close the transaction, but on a slightly modified
basis. The modification to the proposal originally agreed to would compensate the Investors for loss resulting from
the extended outage. To effect this, the Great Bay Bondholders will place 480,000 shares of Great Bay common stock
(to which they would otherwise be entitled) into escrow. If, 1 year after closing, the Investors' original investment
has a market value less than $38.5 million, some or all of the escrowed shares will be distributed to the Investors to
raise their investment to that dollar value. Any remaining escrowed shares will be distributed to the Bondholders.
The net effect of such a distribution to the Investors would be to raise their ownership share to a maximum of 66 percent
rather than 60 percent. Because this modification changes the distribution to the Bondholders under the Plan of Reorganization,
a revised Disclosure Statement must be circulated to the creditors and the Bankruptcy Court must reconfirm the Plan
for Reorganization.

North Atlantic asserts that additional time, anticipated to be about 75 days, is required to obtain reconfirmation
of the Plan of Reorganization and the requisite regulatory approvals and exhaust any appeal periods, but that the
timing of events is largely beyond its control and estimates are unreliable.

North Atlantic has requested (Ropes & Gray letter of August 17, 1994) that the Order's expiration date be extended
until the Bankruptcy Court issues a Final Decree. On the basis of the information in North Atlantic's application
(Ropes & Gray letter of August 17, 1994), I find that there is good cause to extend the expiration date of the Order
Approving Transfer of License dated August 16, 1993.


III



Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 161b, 161i, and 184 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 2201
et seq., and 10 CFR 50.80, it is hereby ordered that: the Order Approving Transfer of License dated August 16, 1993,
is modified to change the latest date for completion of the transfer, as specified in Section III of the August 16, 1993,
Order, to December 31, 1994. Should transfer not be completed by this date, the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation, upon demonstration by North Atlantic of good cause, may in writing relax or rescind any condition of this
Order. The Order of August 16, 1993, except as modified herein, remains in effect.




For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Mall Intercept Survey File No. 270-393


Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval a request to conduct a
mall intercept survey to obtain information on what format and presentation of information about mutual funds will
make it easier for investors to make inferences and make correct comparisons of fees, expenses and risks for different
funds. The results will enable the Commission to better understand the level of investor comprehension of mutual
fund prospectuses. The mall intercept survey is estimated to require a total of 33.33 burden hours. The burden hour
per participant will be .33 hours or 20 minutes.
Direct general comments to the Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below. Direct
any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules
and forms to David T. Copenhafer, Acting Director, Office of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange Commission,

Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
approval for extensions and proposed revisions on the following previously approved rules and forms:


Rule 12g3-2 and proposed Forms 12F and 12FA are used and proposed to be used by foreign issuers to disclose that
they meet certain conditions exempting them from the registration requirements of Section 12g. Approximately 1,800
respondents would file annually at an estimated 1 burden hour per response with a total annual burden of 1,800 hours.


Regulations 13D, 13G and Schedule 13D provide the financial community with relevant information and a fair opportunity
to evaluate publicly-held securities in light of acquisitions or holdings of securities. Approximately 6,536 respondents
file annually at an estimated 13.75 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 89,870 hours.


Rule 13e-1 is designed to provide shareholders and the marketplace with relevant information concerning an
issuer who is repurchasing its securities during a tender offer for such securities by a third party. Approximately
20 respondents file annually at an estimated 13 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 260 hours.


Rule 13e-3 and Schedule 13E-3 prescribes the filing, disclosure and dissemination requirements in connection
with a going private transaction by an issuer or an affiliate. Approximately 221 respondents file annually at an estimated
139.25 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 30,775 hours.


Regulations 14D, 14E and Schedule 14D-1 require information important to security holders in deciding how
to respond to tender offers. Approximately 366 respondents file annually at an estimated 353.25 burden hours per
response with a total annual burden of 129,290 hours.


Rule 29 requires the filing of copies of reports submitted by a registered holding company or its subsidiary companies
to state commissions covering operations not reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Rule 72 makes
the rules under Sections 16 (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 applicable to any duty or liability imposed
under Section 17 (a) or (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The rule imposes an annual burden of 1/4
hour on each of the 62 companies.


Form 3 is an initial statement of beneficial ownership of equity securities required to be filed by officers, directors,
and ten percent holders of companies registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Form 3, as revised, would be filed
by approximately 8,208 respondents at an estimated .5 hours per response for a total annual burden of 4,104 hours.


Form 4 is required to report transactions of officers, directors and ten percent shareholders in their companies'
equity securities. Form 4, as revised, would be filed by approximately 65,704 respondents at an estimated .5 hours
per response for a total annual burden of 32,852 hours.


Form 5 is filed by officers, directors and ten percent shareholders on an annual basis to report transactions and holdings
in their companies' equity securities. Form 5, as revised, would be filed by approximately 38,475 respondents at
an estimated 1 hour per response for a total annual burden of 38,475 hours.

), that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
approval for extensions on the following previously approved rules and forms:

Rule 17Ad-15 requires transfer agents to establish written standards for the acceptance or rejection of guarantees
of securities transfers from eligible guarantor institutions. There are approximately 800 registered transfer
agents subject to the rule's recordkeeping requirements. The average burden for each transfer agent is approximately
40 hours annually, for a total annual burden of 32,000 hours.

Rule 17f-1(b) requires reporting institutions to register with the Commission or its designee to participate
in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program. Approximately 600 respondents incur an average of one-half burden hour
annually to comply with this rule, for a total annual burden of 300 hours.

Rule 17f-1(c) and Form X-17F-1A require reporting institutions to report lost, stolen, missing,
and counterfeit securities to a centralized database. Approximately 23,000 reporting institutions file approximately
667,000 Forms X-17F-1A. The Commission estimates that the average burden for each form is 5 minutes, resulting
in a total annual burden of 55,583 hours.

Rules 17h-1T and 17h-2T impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers that are
associated with other entities, other than natural persons. Approximately 250 broker-dealers are subject to the
rules. It is estimated that the average burden for each firm is approximately 14 hours annually, or a cumulative burden
of 3,500 hours.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval amendments to Regulation S-X under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``1933 Act'') and Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, and Form N-4
under the 1933 Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act''). The amendments pertain to the disclosure
of investment company (``funds'') expenses when such expenses are paid by broker-dealers in exchange for the direction
of the fund's brokerage transactions to the broker-dealer.

The proposed amendment to Regulation S-X would require funds to include in their statements of operations the
amount of any expense that would have been paid had a broker-dealer not paid the expense, in whole or in part, in exchange
for fund brokerage. The proposed amendments to Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3 and Form N-4 would
require that this ``total expense'' figure also be set forth in the fee table and financial highlights table in fund
prospectuses and be used in the calculation of fund yield. The change in burden associated with these amendments will
be reflected in the burdens associated with the various forms proposed to be amended.

It is estimated that 270 funds that file on Form N-1A will each incur 3.0 burden hours in addition to the time currently
required to complete the Form, while 2,430 funds that file on Form N-1A will each incur 1.0 additional burden
hour. It is estimated that twelve funds that file on Form N-2 will each incur 2.5 burden hours in addition to the
time currently required to complete the Form, while 113 funds that file on Form N-2 will each incur 1.0 additional
burden hour. It is estimated that five funds that file on Form N-3 will each incur 1.5 burden hours in addition
to the time currently required to complete Form N-3. Finally, it is estimated that twenty-eight funds that file
on Form N-4 will each incur 1.5 burden hours in addition to the time currently required to complete Form N-4.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Interim Extension of the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service Through October 3, 1994</DOCTITLE>


August 30, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 14 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service
(``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SR-NASD-88-19,
as amended.
 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and
retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter
that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market

sm

 nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities'').
 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation
units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3
Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service
is currently operating under interim approval that expires on September 1, 1994.







The NASD hereby files this proposed rule change, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
to obtain authorization for an interim extension of the Service through October 3, 1994. During this interval, there
will be no material change in the OTCBB Service's operational features, absent Commission approval of a corresponding
Rule 19b-4 filing.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers
an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SR-NASD-92-7) that requested permanent approval of the Service.
For the month ending July 31, 1994, the Service reflected the market making positions of 398 NASD member firms displaying
quotations/indications of interest in approximately 5,082 OTC Equities.
During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR
issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original
approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR
issues will remain indicative.
In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under Section
4 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with Rule 15c2-11
under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the
NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the
Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements
mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly Section 17B of the
Act.
 The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the
development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny
stocks.''




2. Statutory Basis


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and Section
17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational
enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications
techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market
information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things,
that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect
public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of
quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations,
preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations.
Finally, Section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution
of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed.
The NASD believes that extension of the Service through October 3, 1994, is fully consistent with the foregoing provisions
of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940907-2-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940907-2-00077 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The NASD requests that the Commission find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving the proposed
rule change prior to the 30th day after its publication in the 

Federal Register

 to avoid any interruption of the Service. The current authorization for the Service extends through September 1,
1994. Hence it is imperative that the Commission approve the instant filing on or before that date. Otherwise, the
NASD will be required to suspend operation of the Service pending Commission action on the proposed extension. 

The NASD believes that accelerated approval is appropriate to ensure continuity in the Service's operation pending
a determination on permanent status for the Service, as requested in File No. SR-NASD-92-7. Continued
operation of the Service will ensure the availability of an electronic quotation medium to support member firms'
market making in approximately 5,082 OTC Equities and the widespread dissemination of quotation information on
these securities. The Service's operation also expedites price discovery and facilitates the execution of customer
orders at the best available price. From a regulatory standpoint, the NASD's capture of quotation data from participating
market makers supplements the price and volume data reported by member firms pursuant to Section 2 of Schedule H to
the NASD By-Laws. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by September
28, 1994. 



V. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval 



The Commission finds that approval of the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(11) of the Act, which provides that the rules
of the NASD relating to quotations must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, prevent fictitious
or misleading quotations, and promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publishing
notice of the filing thereof. Accelerated approval of the NASD's proposal is appropriate to ensure continuity in
the Service's operation as an electronic quotation medium that supports NASD members' market making in these securities
and that facilitates price discovery and the execution of customers' orders at the best available price. Additionally,
continued operation of the Service will materially assist the NASD's surveillance of its members trading in OTC Equities
that are eligible and quoted in the Service, and in non-Tape B securities that are listed on regional exchanges and
quoted in the OTCBB by NASD members. 



It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved for an interim period
through October 3, 1994. 

 


For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment
No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments No. 2 and No.
3 to Proposed Rule Change to Adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice A-2, Stopping Orders.</DOCTITLE>


August 30, 1994.


I. Introduction


On November 2, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A-2, Stopping Orders. On June 1,
1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope
of its original filing, to revise certain language used therein and to request approval to amend its Minor Rule Violation
and Enforcement Plan (``MRVE Plan'').
 On July 25, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change in order to correct a typographical
error.
 On August 24, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change to clarify
certain procedural requirements.









The proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 34216 (June 15, 1994), 59 FR 32034 (June 21, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves
the proposed rule change, including Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 on an accelerated basis.


II. Description of the Proposal


The Exchange proposes to adopt Advice A-2 in order to codify its policy regarding the handling of stopped orders
on its equity floor.
 Under the proposed rule change, a Phlx specialist who stops an order
 will be required to display a representative size of that order in his or her quote,
 unless the specialist executes the order immediately after granting the stop. In addition, proposed Advice A-2
will prohibit a specialist from trading as principal with a stopped order if he or she is holding an agency order at the
same price (or better) as the interest for the specialist's own account. Pursuant to the Exchange's rules,
 the specialist must exercise due diligence to match the stopped order with such agency order.







The Exchange also proposes to amend its MRVE Plan to include minor violations of Advice A-2 and to establish a
fine schedule for such violations. According to that schedule, inadvertent failure to adhere to the advice's requirements
 may subject a specialist to a $250 fine; a second occurrence during a three-year running calender period could result
in the issuance of a $500 fine. Thereafter, the sanction will be determined at the discretion of the Exchange's Business
Conduct Committee.

The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, by furthering the purposes of Rule 203 which, in turn, should foster a fair and
orderly market in Exchange traded securities.


III. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Sections 6(b), 6(d), 11(b) and 19(d).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposed advice is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements
that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission also believes
that the proposed advice is consistent with the requirement of Section 11(b), and Rule 11b-1 thereunder,
 that specialist transactions must contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.






The Commission historically has been concerned that the practice of stopping stock may compromise the specialist's
fiduciary duty to unexecuted customer orders on the limit order book.
 The Commission, however, has approved the practice in limited circumstances where the potential harm is offset by
gains to the specialist's market making function and by the possibility of price improvement.
 Accordingly, those exchanges with stopping stock rules
 require their specialists to reduce the spread between the consolidated best bid and offer or, in a minimum variation
market, to add size at the inside quote. The Commission believes that such a requirement strikes an appropriate balance
between the interests of various market participants. Moreover, by encouraging accurate representation of the
trading interest held by the specialist, it also facilitates greater transparency in the securities markets. In
the Commission's opinion, such safeguards are a critical aspect of an exchange's stopping stock rule.







After careful review of Advice A-2, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should help ensure
that specialists handle stopped orders in a manner which is consistent with their obligation to maintain fair and
orderly markets.
 Under the proposed advice, a specialist who stops an order will, except as discussed below, be required to display
a representative size of that order in his or her market. As a practical matter, the Phlx has indicated that the specialist
must reduce the spread between the consolidated best bid and offer or, in a minimum variation market, add size at the
inside quote.
 The Commission therefore is satisfied that proposed Advice A-2 should increase the likelihood that a customer
whose order is stopped will receive price improvement and result in narrower and/or deeper markets. This, in turn,
should enhance the liquidity and transparency of the market for securities traded on the Phlx.






The Commission finds that it is reasonable for the Phlx to allow its specialists to execute an order 

immediately 

after granting a stop, so long as the specialist does not use this discretion to circumvent his or her market marking
responsibilities. Because such circumvention would raise serious regulatory concerns, the Commission expects
the Phlx to monitor compliance with Advice A-2 and to take appropriate action if it finds that stopped stock not
executed immediately is not then displayed in the manner indicated in the Phlx proposal.






Finally, the Commission notes that Advice A-2's yielding and due diligence requirements merely codify how
the fundamental principles of an agency auction market apply in the context of stopped stock. In this regard, the Commission
agrees with the Phlx that the advice will provide specialists with a ``ready reminder'' of their responsibilities,
thereby deterring potential violations of Commission and Exchange rules.

Although the Commission has concluded that Advice A-2's requirements are consistent with the Act, the Commission
believes further action could be taken to ensure proper handling of stopped stock. Specifically, the Commission
expects the Phlx to submit a proposed rule change to complement its floor procedure advice. In developing such a rule,
the Phlx should consider including the following elements: a definition of an agreement to ``stop'' stock and the
obligations of the member who agrees to grant the stop; the market conditions under which a stop should be granted;
a policy for the execution of stopped stock and, in particular, for determining the price at which the order should
be executed; and pilot procedures for minimum variation markets that are consistent with the rules of priority, parity
and precedence.






In addition, the Commission finds that the proposed amendments to the MRVE Plan are consistent with the Section 6(b)(6)
requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members and persons associated with its members shall be
appropriately disciplined for violations of rules of the exchange. In this regard, the proposal provides an efficient
procedure for appropriate disciplining of members for a rule violation that is technical and objective in nature.
Moreover, because the MRVE Plan provides procedural rights to the person fined and permits a disciplined person to
request a full hearing on the matter, the proposal provides a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons
associated with members, consistent with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternative means by which to deter violations of the Phlx's
policy regarding specialists' handling of stopped orders, thus furthering the purposes of Section 6(b)(1) of the
Act. An exchange's ability effectively to enforce compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission
and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. A rule included in an exchange's minor rule violation
plan should not be deemed an unimportant rule. The Commission notes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation
plan may reduce reporting burdens on a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') and also may make its disciplinary
system more efficient in prosecuting violations of such rules. This would be the case in situations where the initiation
of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding may be more costly and time-consuming in
view of the minor nature of the particular violation.
In addition, because the Phlx retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violation included
in its MRVE Plan, the Commission believes that adding proposed Advice A-2 to the MRVE Plan will enhance, rather
than reduce, the Phlx's enforcement capabilities regarding this Exchange policy. Indeed, the Commission expects
the Phlx to bring full disciplinary proceedings for violations of the advice's requirements where the violation
is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations.
Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 prior to the thirtieth day after the
date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 2 corrects a typographical error in the text of the proposed
advice, while Amendment No. 3 merely clarifies procedures for implementing the advice's display requirement. The
Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 to
the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all
subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 between the Commission and any persons, other
than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available

<DOCTITLE>IDEX Total Income Trust; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

IDEX Total Income Trust.




RELEVANT ACT SECTION: 

Section 8(f).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant, an open-end diversified management investment company, is organized as a business trust under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On January 7, 1987, applicant filed a notification of registration on
Form N-8A under section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement on Form N-1A under section 8(b) of the
Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on June 24, 1987, and the public offering
of applicant's shares commenced on June 29, 1987.


2. On March 22, 1993, applicant's board of trustees adopted an agreement and plan of reorganization and liquidation
(the ``Plan''). The Plan provided for the transfer of all of applicant's assets to IDEX II Flexible Income Portfolio
(the ``Portfolio''), a separate series of IDEX II Series Fund, a Massachusetts business trust, in exchange for the
assumption by the Portfolio of all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and duties of applicant, and shares of
the Portfolio equal in number to the shares of applicant outstanding as of the close of business on September 30, 1993.


3. Applicant and the Portfolio are affiliated persons because they have common officers; they therefore relied on
the exemption provided by rule 17a-8 under the Act to effect the transaction.
 Consequently, the trustees determined, in accordance with rule 17a-8, that the purchase of applicant's assets
by the Portfolio was in applicant's best interests, and that such purchase would not result in any dilution to the interests
of the existing shareholders.







4. Applicant filed preliminary proxy materials with the SEC on or about May 28, 1993, and filed definitive proxy materials
with the SEC on or about June 24, 1993. On or about June 25, 1993, a notice of the special meeting, proxy statement, and
form of proxy relating to the Plan were distributed to applicant's shareholders. The Plan was approved by vote of applicant's
shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders held on July 28, 1993.


5. As indicated in the proxy materials, the purpose of the reorganization of applicant into the Portfolio was to reduce
the number of separately organized investment companies in the IDEX group, to enable the combination of prospectuses,
statements of additional information, and shareholder reports, and to provide other operational efficiencies
for certain IDEX funds, including applicant and its successor. The reorganization also implemented various changes
to applicant's investment policies and restrictions in order to standardize these matters for the funds in the IDEX
group.


6. As of October 1, 1993, there were 3,048,111.95 shares of beneficial interest of applicant outstanding, with an
aggregate net asset value of $29,232,430 and a per share net asset value of $9.59. On that date, applicant transferred
to the Portfolio all right, title, and interest in and to its assets, including all securities, cash, cash equivalents,
receivables, and other assets. In exchange, the Portfolio assumed all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties
of applicant, and issued and delivered to applicant full and fractional shares of Portfolio equal in number to the
shares of applicant outstanding as of the close of business on September 30, 1993. Applicant then liquidated and distributed


pro rata 

(resulting in a one-for-one distribution) to its shareholders of record the shares of the Portfolio received in exchange
for shareholders' shares of applicant.


7. The expenses incurred in connection with the reorganization consisted primarily of legal expenses, expenses
of printing and mailing communications to shareholders, registration fees, and miscellaneous accounting and administrative
expenses totalling $35,492.71. In accordance with the Plan, the Portfolio was responsible for the expenses of both
parties in connection with the reorganization.


8. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities, nor was it a party to any litigation
or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.


9. Applicant intends to file a notification of dissolution with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is a diversified open-end investment management company organized as a Maryland corporation. On August
22, 1968, applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N-8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On
September 16, 1968 applicant filed a registration statement on Form N-1A under section 8(b) of the Act and under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on July 30, 1969, and applicant's initial
public offering commenced shortly thereafter. 

2. On March 18, 1994, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to
transfer all of its assets and stated liabilities to State Bond Common Stock Fund (the ``Acquiring Fund''), in exchange
for shares of the Acquiring Fund. In accordance with rule 17a-8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined
that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interest of applicant's shareholders, and
that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result.






3. The directors of applicant concluded that the reorganization would benefit applicant's shareholders because
the overall fees charged to the combined fund should result in lower expense ratios than are currently being incurred
by the applicant. 

4. A registration statement on Form N-14 was filed with the SEC on April 6, 1994. The proxy statement/prospectus
contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about May 9, 1994. At a special meeting held on June
21, 1994, holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the reorganization. 

5. The reorganization was consummated on June 25, 1994 (the ``Closing Date''). On June 24, 1994, applicant had aggregate
net assets of $8,605,437 and a net asset value per share of $11.32. On the Closing Date, all of the assets and stated liabilities
of applicant were transferred to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset
value equal to the net assets of applicant. Shares of the Acquiring Fund were then distributed to applicant's shareholders.
Each shareholder received the proportion of Acquiring Fund shares received by applicant that the number of applicant
shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares. 

6. Applicant bore approximately $23,787 in expenses in connection with the reorganization. Such expenses were for
legal, accounting, proxy solicitation, and liquidation fees. 

7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is neither engaged in nor proposes to engage in any business
activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. 

8. Applicant terminated its existence as a Maryland corporation on July 25, 1994.

Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On or about
October 12, 1984, applicant, initially named Equitec Siebel Total Return Fund (``ESTRF''), filed a registration
statement to register an indefinite number of its shares of common stock. The registration statement became effective
on or about January 2, 1985, and ESTRF commenced operations and the initial public offering of its shares on January
29, 1985.

2. On September 30, 1985, ESTRF reorganized into a Massachusetts business trust and was renamed Equitec Siebel Fund
Group (``ESFG''). Over time, ESFG commenced operations of several series: Equitec Siebel Total Return Fund; Equitec
Siebel Government Fund; Equitec Siebel High Yield Bond Fund; Equitec Siebel Aggressive Growth Fund: Equitec Siebel
Cash Equivalent Fund; Equitec Siebel Global Fund; and Equitec Siebel Precious Metals Fund (collectively, the ``Funds'').

3. On January 7, 1991, ESFG's adviser entered into an agreement to sell the Funds' advisory contracts to SunAmerica
Asset Management Corp. (``SunAmerica''). On June 14, 1991, shareholders of the respective Funds approved new investment
advisory and management agreements between ESFG and SunAmerica whereby SunAmerica became the adviser of the Funds.
In connection with the approval, the Funds were renamed: the Total Return Fund was renamed SunAmerica Balanced Assets
Fund; the Government Fund was renamed SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund; the High Yield Bond Fund was renamed
SunAmerica High Income Fund; the Aggressive Growth Fund was renamed SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund; the Cash Equivalent
Fund was renamed SunAmerica Liquid Assets Fund; the Global Fund was renamed SunAmerica Global Equity Fund; and the
Precious Metals Fund was renamed SunAmerica Precious Metals Fund.

4. The Global Equity and Precious Metals Funds were liquidated by vote of their shareholders on March 30, 1992. The
Liquid Assets Fund was liquidated by vote of its shareholders on June 25, 1992.

5. On March 31, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved on agreement and plan of reorganization for each of the
applicant's remaining Funds. Under the agreements, the remaining Funds would merge into other investment companies
that were advised by SunAmerica. In accordance with rule 17a-8 under the Act, the board of trustees of each of
applicant and the acquiring companies determined that participation in the reorganization was in the best interest
of the shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result of the reorganization.
 On July 29, 1993, applicant filed proxy materials with the SEC and mailed these materials to shareholders on or about
July 29, 1993. Applicant's shareholders approved the agreement and plan of reorganization at special meetings held
on September 23, 1993.





6. Pursuant to each agreement, on September 24, 1993, applicant transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities
of (a) its Emerging Growth Fund to the SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund series of SunAmerica Equity Funds in exchange
for shares of the SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund and (b) its Balanced Asset Fund to the SunAmerica Balanced Assets
Fund series of SunAmerica Equity Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund. Applicant then
distributed 

pro rata 

the appropriate shares of SunAmerica Emerging Growth Fund and SunAmerica Balanced Assets Fund to it shareholders.
On October 1, 1993, applicant transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of (i) its U.S. Government
Fund to the SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund series of SunAmerica Income Funds in exchange for shares of
the SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund, and (ii) its High Income Fund to the SunAmerica High Income Fund series
of SunAmerica Income Funds in exchange for shares of the SunAmerica High Income Fund. Applicant then distributed


pro rata 

the appropriate shares of SunAmerica U.S. Government Securities Fund and SunAmerica High Income Fund to its shareholders.
In each case, the aggregate net asset value of an acquiring fund's shares represented the net asset value of the respective
applicant Fund.

7. The expenses of the reorganization were borne by the investment companies participating in the reorganization
of the SunAmerica Family of Mutal Funds, including applicant and each of the acquiring companies. Such expenses included
preparation of proxy materials, printing expenses, and legal and accounting fees. No brokerage commissions were
paid in connection with the reorganization.

8. As of the date of this application, applicant had no assets, liabilities or shareholders. All liabilities and obligations
not discharged by applicant were assumed by and became the obligations of the acquiring funds. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding.

9. Applicant is neither engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.

Third Party Contracting Guidelines Circular Revision 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Transit Administration, DOT.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is revising Circular 4220.1B: Third Party Contracting Guidelines. Before
the Circular is finalized, FTA seeks comments from interested parties on the draft changes. This notice announces
the availability of the Circular for review.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Current contracting guidance for FTA grantees is contained in FTA Circular 4220.1B, ``Third Party Contracting Guidelines,''
dated May 5, 1988, revised February 5, 1990. FTA is revising the Circular to incorporate new provisions included in
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-240, October 28, 1991) and to reflect
a more current contracting policy. Most of the changes are relatively insignificant, and are shown in bold type on
the draft Circular. The agency also particularly seeks comment on the following two matters. 


Since issuing FTA C 4220.1B in 1988, the FTA has required submission of certain contracts for preaward review in areas
where the agency perceived problems. FTA proposes to retain the requirements of Chapter III, FTA Preaward Review
of Third Party Contracts, pertaining to single bids, other than low bid, and brand name. However, FTA requests public
comment on whether these are still problem areas perceived as needing special oversight. 
Similarily, FTA C 4220.1B, as extended into FTA C 4220.1C, does not apply to capital projects where no Federal funds
are involved. However, because Federal operating assistance is provided based upon a percentage of the net deficit
of all operating expenses incurred, FTA has applied the Circular to all operating contracts and proposes in the draft
Circular to continue doing so. This has caused considerable concern and FTA is soliciting specific comments on this
issue. 
All comments received will be reviewed by FTA procurement staff and taken into consideration in refining the guidance
included in the final revised Circular. 
Parties interested in reviewing the draft may request a copy by writing to the Third Party Contract Review Division,
at the address listed in 

ADDRESSES

 section of this document. 
Comments should be sent to the FTA docket, at the address listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this document.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) is seeking the views of interested parties on the operation of the Andean Trade
Preference Act of 1990 (19 U.S.C. 3201(f)) (``the Act''). Section 203(f) of the Act requires the Administration to
submit a report to the Congress on or before the third anniversary of the date of the enactment of the Act, December 4,
1994, regarding the operation of the Act. The TPSC invites written comments which provide views relevant to the issues
to be examined in preparing such a report, including the considerations included in subsections 203 (c) and (d) of
the Act (19 U.S.C. 3201 (b) and (c)).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 203(f) (19 U.S.C. 3201(f)) of the Andean Trade Preference Act states:



On or before the 3rd, 6th, and 9th anniversaries of the date of enactment of this title, the President shall submit to
the Congress a complete report regarding the operation of this title, including the results of a general review of
beneficiary countries based on the consideration described in subsections (c) and (d). In reporting on the considerations
described in subsection (d)(11), the President shall report any evidence that the crop eradication and crop substitution
efforts of the beneficiary are directly related to the effects of this title.



All interested parties are invited to submit comments relevant to the program's operation, including the status
of beneficiary countries_Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru_under the criteria set out in sections (c) and (d)
of the Act (19 U.S.C. 3201 (c) and (d)). Interested parties may comment on any aspect of the program's operation. Issues
to be examined include: the program's effect on the volume and composition of trade and investment between the United

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>




National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Funding Priorities for Fiscal Years 1995-1996 for the Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization
Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes funding priorities for the Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization (D&U) Program under
the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) for fiscal years 1995-1996. The
Secretary takes this action to ensure that rehabilitation knowledge generated from projects and centers funded
by NIDRR and others is utilized fully to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and their families.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains two proposed 
priorities under the D&U program. The priorities are in the areas of disability research dissemination and accessible
data. 



Authority for the D&U program of NIDRR is contained in sections 202 and 204(a) and 204(b)(6) of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 760-762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards to public and private
agencies and organizations, including institutions of higher education and Indian tribes or tribal organizations.


These proposed priorities support the National Education Goal that calls for all Americans to possess the knowledge
and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.


Under the regulations for this program (see 34 CFR 355.32), the Secretary may establish research priorities by reserving
funds to support particular research activities. 

The Secretary will announce the final funding priorities in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of funds, and
the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit 
the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.

 




Note: 

This notice of proposed priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priorities.



Priority 



Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this program only applications that meet these absolute priorities:




Proposed Priority 1: Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research 



Section 200(4)(A) of Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended requires that NIDRR ``ensure the widespread distribution,
in usable formats, of practical scientific and technological information generated by research, demonstration
projects, training, and related activities.'' This priority calls for a center that can assist NIDRR grantees to
better disseminate the results of their research, including increasing the accessibility of research information
to those who need alternate formats. 

Researchers usually report research findings through professional meetings and publications. In order to expand
dissemination of research findings to other audiences, including rehabilitation professionals, individuals
with disabilities, and other interested parties, researchers may need technical assistance and training. Research
is needed to understand the reasons why persons are not utilizing information from NIDRR-sponsored research (e.g.,
unfamiliarity with terminology, inability to utilize the medium, or the lack of availability of the traditional
research publications).

A body of literature currently exists concerning best practices for information dissemination (see Backer, ``Knowledge:
Creation, Diffusion, Utilization,'' Vol. 12, Number 3, March 1991, Sage Publications). Through a model project,
this Center will evaluate the effectiveness of these recommended practices and assist researchers to develop strategies
they can use to determine the best formats and methods to disseminate their research findings to all appropriate audiences.


The proposed center shall support all of the costs associated with the pilot project described below. 



Proposed Priority




A D&U center for the dissemination of disability research shall_

 Identify the format, availability, accessibility (including electronic accessibility), and obstacles
to utilization of disability research faced by a wide range of potential target audiences, including, but not limited
to, persons with disabilities and their families, advocacy organizations, researchers, policymakers at the local,
State and Federal level, journalists, and disability-related service providers; 

 Identify unique issues of disability research information dissemination that apply to persons from minority
backgrounds and develop strategies to address those issues; 

 Identify and develop dissemination strategies that disability researchers can use to identify all appropriate
target audiences, understand the audiences' interests and needs, and disseminate the appropriate information
to all target audiences using each audience's preferred information medium; 

 Identify, develop, and distribute to all NIDRR grantees, technical assistance materials that address format,
availability, accessibility, and dissemination strategies in order to assist the grantees to disseminate their
research findings as effectively as possible to all appropriate audiences; 

 Respond to technical questions and requests for technical assistance on dissemination from all NIDRR grantees
and provide training to the project directors at their annual meeting; 

 Develop (within six months after the award), implement (beginning within 12 months after the award), and evaluate
(beginning 24 months after the award) a pilot dissemination project that solicits nominations of research results
from NIDRR's Rehabilitation Research and Training Center Program grantees, Rehabilitation Engineering Research
Center Program grantees, Field-initiated Research Program grantees, and Research and Demonstration Program grantees,
selects a wide range of those research products (at least one set of products from each of the programs listed above),
and disseminates those findings to all appropriate target audiences using a wide range of formats and media in order
to ensure maximum availability, accessibility, and utility; and

 Provide all of NIDRR's grantees with a quarterly newsletter providing them with technical assistance on research
information dissemination. 



Proposed Priority 2: Improving Access to Disability Data 
Background 



Demographic data and statistical information on disability are extremely valuable in assisting the nation in understanding
the scope of disability issues in America, developing disability policy, and planning, conducting, and evaluating
services for individuals with disabilities. Legislators, policymakers, service providers, and advocates_as
well as manufacturers and retailers_require information on the incidence and prevalence of disability conditions,
the distribution of disability conditions among the population, and the characteristics of individuals with disabilities.
This information is needed in order to develop policy, and plan, administer, and evaluate programs, including health
care programs; assess market demand for goods and services; estimate demand for and the costs of public services;
and evaluate the effectiveness of society's efforts to promote disability prevention, rehabilitation, community
integration and inclusion, and protect the civil rights of individuals with disabilities. 

Data on disability are collected and produced by many groups. The variety of statutory authorities for the collection
of public data sets, the absence of any mandate or resources for comprehensive demographic studies of disability,
and a consistently applied definition of disability have resulted in fragmented, incomplete, and inconsistent
data sets about individuals with disability. One byproduct of this situation has been the focus on explorations and
reconciliations to make these data more useful for further research. 

Yet legislators and program administrators, advocates and journalists continue to use ``data''_numbers, estimates,
projections, and ``best guesses''_as the basis for policy decisions and assessments. It is important that the estimates
used be accurate and that their users understand the implications of the data. Underestimates of certain conditions
or populations may result in failure to plan and provide resources for adequate services; overestimation makes it
impossible to assess the real effectiveness of laws or programs and may discourage efforts to address certain problems
for fear of overwhelming costs. 

There is a need for presentation of data in meaningful, understandable, and accessible formats usable by persons
with a range of educational levels and technical skills, sensory disabilities, languages, and cognitive abilities.
There is also a need to make disability data available to the broad range of target audiences referred to above. 

NIDRR has attempted to address many of the problems of unsatisfactory databases and the need to increase understanding
of the demography of disability by supporting research projects and centers that primarily compile and analyze data
and train researchers and statisticians. This scholarly effort has not addressed sufficiently the widescale dissemination
of data that is presented in useful, meaningful, and accessible formats for a variety of audiences not experienced
in the nuances of data interpretation. Further, NIDRR's data research program has, almost of necessity, been focused
on data that relate to health conditions and health care needs. 

NIDRR also has identified a need to improve the ability of individuals with disabilities and the parents, persons
from minority backgrounds with disabilities, family members, guardians, advocates, or authorized representatives
of the individuals to access information. In addition, many persons with disabilities need comprehension aids that
will allow them to understand and utilize the information they access. 

The proposed project on access to disability data will focus on the synthesis, interpretation, presentation, and
dissemination of statistical information on disability to a wide target audience. It will provide training in the
interpretation and use of disability data to individuals with disabilities and their organizations, and will involve
individuals with disabilities in the identification of information needs and channels of access, evaluation of
the materials prepared in the project, and dissemination of products.

Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Concept release.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') solicits recommendations on the Commission's role in
using the ratings of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (``NRSROs''). Because of the expanded
use of credit ratings in the Commission's rules, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to examine the process
employed by the Commission to designate rating agencies as NRSROs and the nature of the Commission's oversight role
with respect to NRSROs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction and Background


In recent years, the credit ratings issued by agencies that are recognized as nationally recognized statistical
rating agencies (``NRSROs'') have attained an increased level of importance within the context of the Commission's
rules and regulations. The Commission looks to the credit ratings issued by NRSROs in a variety of contexts, and for
different purposes, to distinguish among various grades of debt and other rated securities. 
The increasing utilization of credit ratings as a component in Commission rules, in turn, has prompted a number of
domestic and foreign rating agencies to seek NRSRO status. Currently, the Commission's rules do not define the term
``NRSRO,'' nor is there a formal mechanism for monitoring the activities of agencies that have been recognized as
NRSROs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to issue a concept release soliciting comment
on the appropriate role of ratings in the federal securities laws, and the need to establish formal procedures for
designating and monitoring the activities of NRSROs. 



A. The Development of the Term ``NRSRO''



In 1975, the Commission adopted the uniform net capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which in part also incorporated the use of ratings issued by NRSROs in connection with
certain provisions of the net capital rule.

1

 Rule 15c3-1 requires broker-dealers, when computing net capital, to deduct from net worth certain percentages
of the market value (``haircuts'') of their proprietary securities positions. Haircuts serve as a safeguard against
the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of each broker-dealer's proprietary securities. Broker-dealers'
proprietary positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt securities and nonconvertible preferred stock
are accorded preferential treatment under the net capital rule, in the form of reduced haircuts, if the instruments
are rated investment grade by at least two NRSROs.

2

 The Commission did not attempt to define the term in the context of the net capital rule and, in using the term subsequently
in other regulatory contexts, the Commission generally has stated that the term should have the same meaning as it
does for purposes of the net capital rule.

3

 






B. Expanded Use of the Term ``NRSRO'' and Utilization of the Ratings Assigned to Securities by NRSROs



Over time, the NRSRO concept has been incorporated into other areas of the federal securities laws and Congress itself
employed the term ``NRSRO'' in the definition of ``mortgage related security.'' Pursuant to Section 3(a)(41) of
the Exchange Act, which was added by the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984,

4

 a mortgage related security must, among other things, be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least
one NRSRO.

5

 Although Congress did not define what it meant by an NRSRO, its reliance on the term used in Commission rules is significant
because it reflects a congressional recognition that the ``term has acquired currency as a term of art.''

6

<DOCNO> FR940907-2-00133 </DOCNO>

In addition, several regulations issued pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''),

7

 the Exchange Act,

8

 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'')

9

 have incorporated the term ``NRSRO'' as it is used in the net capital rule. For example, the Commission employs NRSRO
ratings as a basis for distinguishing between certain types of securities that may be issued using simplified registration
procedures under the Securities Act.

10

 NRSRO ratings also are employed in connection with investment restrictions applicable to money market funds. Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act requires a money market fund to limit its investments to securities that
are ``Eligible Securities,''

11

 which, among other things, are securities rated in one of the two highest rating categories for short-term debt by
the requisite number of NRSROs.









Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which exempts certain structured financing from registering under
and complying with the Investment Company Act, also utilizes the ratings of NRSROs.

12

 Under paragraph (2)(a) of Rule 3a-7, an issuer of fixed income securities that are rated in one of the four highest
categories by at least one NRSRO is deemed not to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In adopting
the rule, the Commission recognized that rating agencies had been ``successful in analyzing the structural integrity
of financing * * * [and] appear to have been a major factor in investor acceptance of structured financing.''

13








In proposing Rule 3a-7, the Commission requested specific comment on whether a rating requirement was necessary
and, if not, on what alternative bases the Commission should exclude structured financing from the Investment Company
Act. The Commission also requested comment on whether rating agencies should be subject to additional regulatory
requirements. Those commentators who specifically addressed the issue registered strong support for use of NRSRO
ratings in the structured financing context. The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. and
the Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') opposed reliance on NRSRO ratings in this context. Of the commentators
addressing additional regulatory requirements for rating agencies generally, a large majority opposed Commission
regulation of rating agencies, whereas several others argued that questions of regulatory oversight should be addressed
separately from the merits of the proposed rule. The ICI was the only commentator supporting additional government
oversight.

Finally, Rule 10b-6 under the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons participating in a distribution of securities
from artificially conditioning the market for the securities in order to facilitate the distribution, employs an
NRSRO concept as well. Generally, Rule 10b-6 exempts certain transactions in nonconvertible debt and nonconvertible
preferred securities from its coverage if the securities, among other things, are rated investment grade by at least
one NRSRO.

<TEXT>
 

The utilization of NRSRO ratings, therefore, is an important component of the Commission's regulatory program.
Initially, the Commission solicits comment as to whether it should continue to employ in its rules the term ``NRSRO''
and the ratings assigned to various debt and other rated securities by NRSROs. The Commission also invites commentators
to consider alternative means by which the Commission could distinguish among various grades of debt and other rated
securities. 
In addition, with the advent of limited scope ratings of the type applied, for example, to ``cash flow securities,''
 and with the proliferation of structured securities subject to substantial non-credit payment risks, it is appropriate
to review the regulatory use of ratings and to specify, if necessary, what types of ratings fall within each of the regulatory
provisions that refer to specific ratings. We also request comment regarding whether a limited scope rating by NRSROs
should qualify for the exemption from liability under section 11 of the Securities Act.
 





Rating agencies and other organizations have developed ratings of open-end and other types of investment companies.
These ratings serve a number of purposes. Three rating agencies, Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (``Fitch''), Standard
& Poor's Corporation (``Standard & Poor's''), and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (``Moody's''), issue
ratings that assess the safety of principal invested in a money market mutual fund. These rating agencies also have
begun to rate different characteristics of bond funds.
 For example, Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's each issue bond fund ratings designed to identify the degree
of credit risk in a bond fund's underlying investments. Fitch and Standard & Poor's also issue bond fund ``stability''
or ``market risk'' r
