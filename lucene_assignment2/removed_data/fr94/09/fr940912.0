Pink Bollworm Regulated Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document makes final an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by removing Craighead, Cross,
Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas, Concordia Parish in Louisiana, and Washington County
in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas, and removing Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States
quarantined because of the pink bollworm. The interim rule was necessary to relieve restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from certain previously regulated areas.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27965-27966, Docket No. 94-034-1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations
in 7 CFR part 301 by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas; Concordia
Parish in Louisiana and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas in  301.52-2a.
We also stated that the interim rule would remove Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined to
prevent the spread of the pink bollworm since there would not be any areas in those States regulated because of the pink
bollworm. We stated that change would affect 
 301.52-2a; it should have stated it would affect  301.52(a). However, we inadvertently left that
action out of the amendatory section of the interim rule. This final rule corrects that omission. 

Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 1, 1994. We did not receive any comments
by that date. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 

This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 



Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.




Accordingly, the interim rule that amended 7 CFR 301.52-2a and that was published at 59 FR 27965-27966
on May 31, 1994, is adopted as a final rule with the following changes: 



PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 


1. The authority citation for part 301 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 150bb, 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 161, 162, and 164-167; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).






2. In  301.52, paragraph (a), the words ``Louisiana, Mississippi,'' are removed.

Irish Potatoes Grown in Certain Designated Counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and Imported Irish Potatoes;
Modification of Minimum Size Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule modifies the minimum size requirements for all varieties of potatoes, except round reds, grown in
certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and for imported long type potatoes. Currently,
the minimum size requirement for all varieties, except round reds, is 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. This
rule specifies that, in addition, at least 
40 percent of the potatoes in each lot, by weight, must be 
5 ounces or heavier. Requiring handlers to ship heavier potatoes should correct a marketing problem by providing
the heavier potatoes demanded by the market and increase returns to producers and handlers. As provided under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the changes will also apply to imported potatoes.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945 [7 CFR part 945], as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order,'' regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho,
and Malheur County, Oregon. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



This final rule, which also affects the import requirements for long type Irish potatoes, is also issued pursuant
to section 8e of the Act. The provisions of section 8e and the potato import regulation are discussed later in this final
rule. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.


This final has been reviewed under Executive 
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.


The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is not filed
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 

There are approximately 60 handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes that are subject to regulation under the order,
and approximately 2,000 producers in the production area. In addition, at least 75 importers of Irish potatoes are
subject to import regulations and will be affected by this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include
handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
The majority of the importers of potatoes may also be classified as small entities. 

This rule amends paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of  945.341 Handling regulation of the order's rules and regulations,
and is based on a unanimous recommendation made by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee (committee), the agency
responsible for local administration of the order, at its June 7, 1994, public meeting. The committee's recommended
revision is authorized pursuant to   945.51 and 945.52 of the order. 

Quality assurance is very important to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry. Providing the public with acceptable
quality produce which is appealing to the consumer on a consistent basis is necessary to maintain buyer confidence
in the marketplace. The committee reports that potato size is important to buyers. 

For several decades, the minimum size requirement for all varieties of Idaho-Oregon potatoes, except round reds,
has been 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. However, the committee reports that the industry has been losing
its share of the potato market, because the market in recent years has been demanding potatoes larger than this minimum
size. Consumers now expect some baker size potatoes in the packages they buy. In spite of an industry campaign to encourage
handlers to voluntarily ship larger potatoes, a number of handlers have continued to ship potatoes that barely meet
the minimum size requirement, depressing the price for other potatoes. These potatoes are generally shipped in consumer
packs (e.g., 5- or 10-pound bags) or in 100-pound sacks for later repackaging into consumer packs. 

These shipments have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers in recent years, hurting the quality image
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, reducing repeat purchases and overall sales volume, and resulting in declines
in prices, which has hurt the overall sales volume.

To better meet market demand regarding the size of potatoes, the committee recommended an additional requirement
that at least 40 percent of the potatoes in each lot must weigh at least 5 ounces. It is anticipated that requiring handlers
to ship such heavier potatoes will enable the industry to regain its lost share of the market and increase returns to
producers and handlers. 
Section 8e of the Act requires that when certain domestically produced commodities, including Irish potatoes, are
regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements, subject to concurrence by the U.S. Trade Representative. Section 8e also provides
that whenever two or more marketing orders regulating a commodity produced in different areas of the United States
are concurrently in effect, the Secretary shall determine which of the areas produces the commodity in more direct
competition with the imported commodity. Imports, then must meet the quality standards set for the particular area.

In the case of potatoes, the current import regulation [7 CFR 980.1] specifies that import requirements for long type
potatoes be based on those in effect for potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County,
Oregon, during each month of the marketing year. While no changes are required in the language of section 980.1, imports
of long type potatoes would have to meet the increased minimum weight requirements proposed herein. 
Section 945.341(i) 

Applicability to imports

 is being removed from the handling regulations. That paragraph states the same information that is contained in section
980.1 of the import regulations. Since the same information applicable to imported potatoes is contained in the import
regulations, paragraph (i) in the domestic handling regulations is being deleted to eliminate duplication or confusion.

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 9, 1994 [59 FR 40477]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until August 24,
1994. No comments were received. 
After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the new shipping season for the 1994-95
crop of Russet Burbanks began September 1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many potatoes
of the 1994-95 crop as possible; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period and no comments were
received.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its Delegation of Authority to add the authority to
the Regional and Power Supply Directors to cancel or endorse due to payment on borrowers' notes which have been paid
in full in connection with a discounted prepayment made under the REA electric program. These delegations and other
minor technical corrections are being made to clarify the delegations of authority and further delegate authority
downward. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Administrator of REA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). 


National Environmental Policy Act Certification 


The Administrator of REA has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human
environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 


Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 


The programs described by this final rule are listed in the 1991 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under
No. 10.850, Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees; No. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees;
No. 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans; and No. 10.854, Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants. This catalog

State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2)
will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file
suit challenging the provisions of this rule. 


Executive Order 12372 


This final rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultant. A Notice of Final
rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric
loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this Order. 


Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements 


This final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping provisions requiring the Office of Management
and Budget approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 
This final rule revises and reflects the current organizational structure of REA and methods of by which its functions
are channeled. Accordingly, since this action is a ``* * * rule of the agency organization, procedure,
or practice * * *'' this rule is being issued as a final rule without providing the public with an opportunity
to comment.

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations concerning the importation
of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union,
Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro
and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists, and by adding Oman, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness (AHS). Outbreaks
of CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland,
Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia
(Montenegro and Serbia). The Member States of the European Union either are affected with CEM or trade horses freely
with other Member States that are affected with CEM, without testing the horses for the disease. Oman, Qatar, and the
United Arab Emirates trade horses freely with other countries where AHS, a fatal viral disease, exists. The interim
rule imposed prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of horses that have been in these countries to protect
horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. Neither disease is known to exist in the United States.

ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts interim regulations
that amend FCA regulations relating to collateral evaluation requirements for Farm Credit System (FCS or System)
institutions engaged in lending or leasing. The FCA Board also requests comments on these regulations. The amendments
respond to issues raised by regulatory revisions recently adopted by the other Federal financial institutions'
regulatory agencies (Federal regulatory agencies),

1 

comments received in response to the FCA's published request for ``regulatory burden'' comments (58 FR 34003, June
23, 1993), and amendments made to regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Regulation B) interpreting
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. General 


The FCA Board adopted final collateral evaluation regulations on November 12, 1992. The regulations were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54683), and became effective March 1, 1993. The regulations addressed the System's collateral
evaluation practices and procedures, including the need for: 
(1) Consistent methodology; (2) independence and controls; and (3) consistent educational and qualification requirements.
The regulations set basic requirements for real property appraisals, including the use of State licensed and/or
certified appraisers, functional independence, and compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practices (USPAP). The real property appraisal requirements adopted were similar to the requirements of the other
Federal regulatory agencies. 
The objective of the present amendments is to provide additional flexibility in appraisal and independence requirements,
without jeopardizing the overall integrity or enforceability of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations.
By providing additional flexibility in the use of State-sanctioned appraisers and relief from the more stringent
real estate appraisal requirements, the FCA addresses regulatory burden concerns. 
The amendments are being adopted as interim regulations with a delayed effective date and request for comments in
order to provide interested parties an opportunity to comment on the regulations. However, the FCA believes adopting
the regulations in final is required to provide System institutions with the necessary guidance to address revisions
to their collateral evaluation requirements and necessary staffing needs. The regulatory revisions also establish
requirements that are similar to the requirements recently adopted by the Federal regulatory agencies. 
The FCA adopted, on May 5, 1994, a ``no action'' position relative to the System institutions' compliance with certain
real estate appraisal requirements in response to the then-pending regulatory revisions by the Federal regulatory
agencies. The FCA's ``no action'' position was intended to serve as a temporary means of eliminating any competitive
disadvantage suffered by System institutions. However, the ``no action'' position provides more flexibility than
the FCA would consider a prudent long-term regulatory position. Therefore, these regulatory revisions are intended
to eliminate any competitive disadvantage for the System institutions and establish the necessary guidance and
parameters for the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures.

These revisions to the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations only address the issues associated with the real
estate appraisal requirements and do not lessen the overall requirements that have been established for the basic
collateral evaluation requirements or the collateral valuation process. The FCA Board is aware of the System's concern
about informational requirements for small loans. The FCA has received comments requesting consideration of guidance
for ``minimum information'' loan programs (including financial reporting and collateral evaluation information)
and related underwriting standards. The FCA believes these regulations provide flexibility to accommodate minimum
information loan programs. However, the FCA will consider these issues at a later date in response to the ``regulatory
burden'' notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003). 
The regulations also make technical revisions to part 614, subpart L, concerning credit denials and independent
appraisal requirements. Finally, the regulations reconcile FCA regulations pertaining to the release of collateral
evaluation information (part 618, subpart G), with the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as interpreted
by Regulation B.

II. Background 


A. Bank and Thrift Federal Regulatory Agencies' Positions 


On March 10, 1993, the four Federal regulatory agencies responsible for regulating banks and thrifts issued a joint
interagency statement that eased certain regulatory constraints on the availability of credit for small business
loans (including farm loans). The ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability'' (``Policy Statement'')
identified five areas of concern for possible regulatory and operational revisions. The five areas are: (1) Lending
to small- and medium-sized businesses; (2) real estate lending and appraisals; (3) appeals of examination decisions
and complaint handling; (4) examination processes and procedures; and (5) paperwork and regulatory burdens. 
While FCA was not a party to the Policy Statement released on March 10, 1993, it does have real property appraisal regulations
in place that are similar to those of the Federal regulatory agencies. In addition, the Policy Statement includes
farming operations as a segment of the small- and medium-sized businesses to be covered by any revisions arising from
the Policy Statement. Therefore, any change in the Federal regulatory agencies' real property appraisal requirements

4

 will impact the FCA and the System in terms of the consistency and application of the collateral evaluation requirements.





In discussing the real estate lending and appraisal concerns, the Policy Statement asserted that ``in some cases
currently required real estate appraisals may not add to the safety and soundness of the credit decision. Indeed,
in some cases, appraisals may prove so expensive that they make a sound small- or medium-sized business loan uneconomical.''

5

 President Clinton directed the Federal regulatory agencies to review the existing real property appraisal regulations
and address changes as appropriate. The policy position implemented by the Federal regulatory agencies is considered
to be ``one aspect of an overall effort by the agencies to evaluate carefully and react appropriately to risk in the
United States financial services industry. That overall effort envisions substantial oversight; in some cases,
more than we have now, in areas that pose greater risk to the system. By the same token, regulatory burden will be reduced
where risk is low, especially for strong, well-managed banks and thrifts * * *.''

6 







The recent amendments to the other Federal regulatory agencies' real estate appraisal requirements relate to: (1)
Appraisals of real estate offered as collateral for small- and medium-sized business loans; (2) appropriate appraisal
threshold levels (

de minimis

); and (3) exemptions from requirements for the use of State-sanctioned appraisers. In addition, the agencies have
eliminated the regulatory prohibition on the use of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP)
``departure provision''

7

 for real property appraisals.

On June 4, 1993, the bank and thrift Federal regulatory agencies published proposed regulations (58 FR 31878) to amend
the existing real property appraisal regulations. On November 10, 1993, the Federal regulatory agencies solicited
additional comments on the database supporting the 

de minimis

 level proposal (58 FR 59688). The OCC, FDIC, FRB, and OTS subsequently adopted final regulations, which were published
on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482). The major changes made by the final regulations are: 

1. Increasing the 

de minimis

 level to $250,000 above which real estate appraisals using State licensed and/or certified appraisers are required.


2. Providing an exception for small- and medium-sized ``business loans,'' including loans to entities and individuals
engaged in farming enterprises, with a transaction value of $1.0 million or less. 

3. Clarifying the ``abundance of caution'' exception. 

4. Providing additional exceptions to the use of State licensed and/or certified real estate appraisers. 

5. Clarifying appraisal standards and appraiser independence requirements. 



B. FCA's Consideration 



On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board adopted a policy position requesting public comment on possible regulatory burden
issues addressing a variety of subjects. This ``Regulatory Burden'' statement was published on June 23, 1993 (58
FR 34003). On July 15, 1993, the FCA Board directed staff to begin considering appropriate revisions of the FCA's regulations
and to monitor the progress of the regulatory revisions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. 

The FCA received 15 comment letters in response to its regulatory burden statement from various System institutions
and related parties addressing collateral evaluation related issues. The commenters, in general, supported the
positions that had previously been proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The commenters also expressed concerns
with the inclusion of specific standards of the collateral evaluation regulations (i.e., general valuation and
personal property requirements) as well as specific requirements of part 614, subpart L, as they pertain to the appraisal
requirements for reconsideration of loan denials. In addition, the FCA has received two additional sets of comments
requesting that the FCA consider the positions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA responds to the
comments received in Section IV, 

Regulatory Revisions

, of this document. 



III. Historical Analysis 



The FCA has not identified any System institution that has failed solely because of poor or fraudulent appraisal activities.
However, there have been institutions that have failed where poor collateral evaluation practices have been a contributing
factor. A review of several of the institutions that failed during the 1980s has indicated that when such institutions
failed, they exhibited characteristics such as: (1) Poor credit administration practices; (2) poor internal controls;
(3) poor collateral evaluation practices; and (4) lack of credit expertise to handle increased debt levels and loan
volume. The majority of the institutions that failed or required some form of assistance did so because of losses experienced
in a few large, complex, and/or specialized loans. Poor collateral evaluation practices coupled with one or more
of the other characteristics described above contributed to the problems faced by the institutions. 

With the implementation of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations, the institutions have been required to
establish and implement appropriate collateral evaluation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures
are needed to address collateral evaluation independence requirements and basic evaluation and appraisal standards,
as well as educational and qualification requirements. The development of such policies and procedures coupled
with appropriate internal controls, credit controls, and underwriting standards (i.e., lending limits, financial
and repayment analysis, loan inspections, etc.) will help ensure that past problems are not repeated. 

The FCA's collateral evaluation regulations require that all System institutions will perform a collateral evaluation
on all secured loans and leases. Such collateral evaluations will take the form of a basic valuation or a more detailed
real estate appraisal, depending on the loan collateral and the specifics of the loan decision. The basic requirements
concerning individuals responsible for collateral evaluations address minimum education, qualification, independence,
and methodology standards that are either established by the regulation or must be established by the institution's
policies and procedures consistent with the requirements of the regulations.

<TEXT>
 

The additional requirements for completion of real estate appraisals, including the use of State-sanctioned appraisers,
require a higher degree of independence and higher education and methodology standards. While higher standards
are desirable, it has been argued by the System, as well as by the banking and thrift industries, that universal application
of these higher standards and the additional cost involved do not add to the safety and soundness of these institutions.
They argue that such higher standards add unnecessary costs and delays to the credit process without providing a corresponding
reduction in loan defaults and losses in the institutions' smaller loans. The System and commercial banking institutions
further argue that collateral valuations completed by qualified and experienced persons, other than State licensed
or certified appraisers, are more appropriate and cost-effective for the majority of their loans and the associated
risk. 

The FCA believes that it is the responsibility of the institution to establish adequate policies and procedures for
collateral evaluations, taking into consideration the basic requirements of the FCA's regulations. The institutions
are responsible for determining the level of documentation required, depending on the size, complexity, and specialization
of the loan transaction. As an example, a $50,000 loan that qualifies for an institution's minimum information program
could require considerably less support, information, and documentation than a $500,000 loan to finance a large,
complex dairy operation not typical of the operations within an institution's territory. Under these revised regulations,
both loan transactions could qualify as collateral valuations rather than as real estate appraisals; but the complexity,
size, and specialization of the loan for the dairy operation would call for a higher degree of support information
development and documentation. The FCA notes that such flexibility already exists in the current regulations. 

The lending institution, not the collateral evaluator, is ultimately responsible for its credit decisions. The
collateral evaluation is only one of several factors that must be considered when making a credit decision. While
the collateral evaluation report must be completed by a qualified individual, institutions should not assume that
the acceptance of the collateral evaluation report substitutes for or completes the credit decision process. The
FCA expects the institutions to consider all relevant credit factors (including the collateral evaluation) as part
of the credit decision. If an institution is not comfortable with the reported value of the collateral, the institution
can request another evaluation, decrease the loan amount accordingly, or, provided other statutory and regulatory
requirements are satisfied, change the terms of the loan consideration in recognition of the perceived collateral
risk. 

An institution need not lend 85 percent of the value shown by an evaluation. Rather it should limit the credit to the
amount that can be supported by consideration of the risk associated with all credit factors, including the collateral
evaluation. It is important to note that as the complexity or specialization of the subject property increases, the
degree of support documentation should also increase and should take into account the unique characteristics of
the property that make it complex or specialized. 



IV. Regulatory Revisions 



Taking into account the comments received in response to the FCA's ``regulatory burden'' notice, the FCA staff studied
FCA's current collateral evaluation regulations, compared current regulations with those of the other Federal
regulatory agencies, and completed a study of data submitted to the FCA by the System. Based on its study, the FCA has
adopted the following positions. 



A. Increased Appraisal Thresholds 



The regulations amend  614.4260(b) to increase the existing 

de minimis

 levels on the appraisal requirements of the System institutions to $250,000. In addition, the threshold for the functional
independence requirements would also be increased in connection with the appraisal 

de minimis

 level. 

In 1992, the FCA completed an analysis to determine the segregation by size of the collateral securing the System's
loan portfolio. The database for the analysis included a summary of the number and volume of loans within the FCS banks
and associations as of December 31, 1991, that were unsecured, secured by personal property, secured by real property,
or secured by a combination of security types. 

The data were further segregated by loan-size categories. The FCA study has subsequently been updated to reflect
the December 31, 1992, and December 31, 1993, loan-size and collateralization information.

<TEXT>
 

The FCA has also recently received the results of a study it commissioned through the University of Illinois to perform
independently of the development of these regulations (University of Illinois study). This study examined the loan
origination volume, associated defaults, and loan losses for a specific Farm Credit district for a period between
1973 and 1992 to determine, among other things, whether large loans have a higher default rate than small loans. 
In addition, the Farm Credit Council, on behalf of the System institutions, has provided additional loan-size and
loan-loss data to the FCA for further consideration of the 

de minimis 

level. Finally, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has also completed a survey,
 which included a sample of 246 commercial banks of various sizes and portfolio structures. The survey stratified
the loan portfolios by loan size and by loan type (construction, farmland, multifamily, and nonfarm).
 







Upon review of the available data, the University of Illinois' study data, the System's data, and the ABA's commercial
bank data, several conclusions can be drawn. Each of the studies attempted to study the correlation between loan losses
and loan size. There appears to be very little difference in the average size of the ABA reported farmland loans and
the System institutions' loans. The establishment of a consistent threshold level would encompass similar percentages
of the farmland-based loan portfolio of System institutions and commercial banks. However, the System institutions
will have a greater percentage of farmland-based loan volume that would be in excess of a $250,000 

de minimis 

level. An increase in the 

de minimis 

level would result in the System institutions being afforded the same flexibility as the commercial lenders to perform
collateral valuations rather than 
USPAP-based, State-sanctioned appraisals. This will result in a significant reduction in the number of loans that
would 
require the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser
 and thus result in cost savings to the borrowers/consumers. The System data indicate that the difference in the cost
of an appraisal versus a valuation averages approximately $300 per evaluation. Such reported cost differences are
consistent with cost data that have been reported by the commercial banking industry. 




The FCA recognizes that increasing the 

de minimis 

level will reduce the number of transactions requiring a USPAP appraisal completed by a State-sanctioned appraiser.
The FCA's analysis of the available data suggested that for loans in excess of $250,000, the rate of loss justifies
the cost of the USPAP appraisal requirement, while for loans of less than $100,000, the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals
may exceed the volume of losses. For loans in the $100,000 to $250,000 range, the data do not clearly establish that
the rate of loss justifies the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals. Therefore, the FCA believes that a 

de minimis 

level of $250,000 is a reasonable point above which the additional appraisal requirements are justified. In addition,
the FCA is comfortable that safety and soundness concerns at or below $250,000 can be adequately addressed by the collateral
valuation requirements of the regulations. 


B.

 Business Loans 


The regulations amend  614.4260(b) to provide the System institutions with a $1.0 million threshold for requiring
appraisals for small- and medium-sized ``business loans'' where the loan repayment is not derived from the sale or
cash rental of real estate. 
The purpose of this exemption is to provide greater flexibility for institutions to provide credit to small- and medium-sized
businesses where the owners are subject to the risk of operational losses. The exemption is not intended to ease credit
requirements for real estate investors or passive landowners. A $1.0 million exemption would be consistent with
the positions taken by the Federal regulatory agencies and will afford the System institutions a ``level playing
field'' with respect to the required use of State-sanctioned appraisers. Based on FCA's analysis of the data studies,
it should be noted that, in addition to the additional 15 percent (by number) of System loans exempted by the new $250,000
de minimis 

level exception, approximately an additional 5 percent of the number of loans will be exempted by the $1.0 million
``business loan'' exemption.

<DOCNO> FR940912-0-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, within this $250,000 to the $1.0 million category, an additional 25 percent of loan volume will be exempted
by the new business loan exemption. These additional loans represent a significant proportion of System loan volume
and arguably pose significant additional risk for System institutions. Because of this concentration, the FCA has
provided additional criteria for the completion of collateral evaluations for such small- and medium-sized business
loans by requiring all real estate collateral evaluations in excess of $250,000, not otherwise exempted by  614.4260(c),
to be completed in conformance with the USPAP. Such collateral evaluations of ``business loans,'' while conforming
with USPAP, will not necessitate the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser or compliance with the functional independence
requirements. 
While the regulations allow institutions to use either a State licensed or State certified appraiser for loan transactions
under the $1.0 million level, the regulations require appraisals of real estate transactions over $1.0 million to
be completed by State certified appraisers. The FCA notes that this requirement is consistent with the requirements
of the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA),

11

 which requires the use of a State certified appraiser for a real estate transaction appraisal of $1.0 million or more.






C. Additional Collateral 



The regulations expand the exceptions for the use of State licensed and certified appraisers to include those instances
where the real estate is taken as additional collateral or where the loan is supported through conclusive documentation
of earnings capacity and repayment ability evidencing that the real estate is not necessary to support the loan decision.



Adoption of the additional collateral exception and clarifying the ``abundance of caution'' exception gives System
institutions more flexibility in relying on collateral valuations of real property rather than USPAP-based 
State-sanctioned appraisals. However, the FCA believes that the basic collateral valuation requirements and the
institutions' policies and procedures will provide sufficient analysis and detail to address any safety and soundness
concerns. 



D. Limit Periodic Appraisals 




The regulations amend  614.4260(c) to permit the use of collateral valuations of real estate when a subsequent
transaction is related to the advancement of additional funds, a servicing action, loan reamortization, etc., provided
there has been no obvious and material change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the real estate that would
threaten the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction. The regulations
continue to require the institutions to develop appropriate policies and procedures addressing the circumstances
and frequency for the completion of real property appraisals versus collateral valuations, subject to the specific
requirements of the regulation. 
This revision would provide greater flexibility to the System institutions in determining the appropriate collateral
evaluation method to employ (valuation vs. appraisal) and the appropriate level of evaluator expertise required
in relation to the associated credit risk. This revision would allow institutions to use collateral valuations instead
of appraisals when a loan servicing action is required, a loan is being reamortized, or even when additional funds
are advanced as long as the collateral risk has not materially increased. This revision would also eliminate the requirement
that a new appraisal be completed if additional funds are advanced and an appraisal has not been completed within 2
years, as was previously required by the regulations. 



These exemptions only address the use of real estate appraisals and are not intended to eliminate the need for a review
and update of the value of the collateral through the use of a collateral valuation. The FCA's regulation 
( 614.4260(c)(5)) would require a new evaluation for reamortizations of loans if there has been a material
increase in the associated risk in concert with the advancement of new funds. This position is consistent with the
requirements of the Federal regulatory agencies for transactions where new funds are advanced and there has been
a material increase in the associated risk. However, in addition, the FCA, based on safety and soundness concerns
identified in previous System practices, has taken the position that any loan servicing action (including reamortizations,
collateral releases, etc.) should be accompanied, at a minimum, by a collateral valuation that is consistent with
the requirements of these regulations.

<TEXT>
 

E. USPAP ``Departure Provision'' 


The regulations amend  614.4265(h) to remove the prohibition on the use of the USPAP ``Departure Provision.''
The removal of the restriction will allow institutions to determine the best evaluation method to support the credit
decision consistent with safe and sound lending practices that also best serves the borrower. The elimination of
this restriction will also provide more flexibility for the institutions in the use of their appraiser resources
by allowing State licensed and certified appraisers to complete updated appraisals and collateral valuations that
would not otherwise meet the USPAP standards requirements. 
The FCA and the Federal regulatory agencies originally included the restriction on the use of the ``departure provision''
because they were concerned that the use of the provision would result in an evaluation that is less than reliable.
However, upon further discussion and clarification from the Appraisal Foundation,
 the Federal regulatory agencies now recognize that a ``departure provision'' appraisal provides the basic information
and valuation criteria required to ensure a reliable valuation process.
 Therefore, the prohibition on the use of the ``departure provision'' has been removed. 





F. Technical Amendments 


The regulations make technical amendments to subpart F pertaining to issues such as an institution's review requirements
for appraisals completed by other financial institutions or government agencies. The FCA has eliminated the review
procedures from  614.4255(d), because it is recognized that other U.S. Government agencies, 
Government-Sponsored Enterprises and/or Federally regulated financial institutions are all guided in their appraisal
requirements by USPAP and FIRREA requirements, which are at least as encompassing as FCA's regulatory requirements.

In addition, the regulations make technical amendments to part 614, subpart L, concerning an institution's responsibilities
for accepting an independent appraisal completed in response to a credit denial action. In addition, the regulations
make changes to part 618, subpart G, concerning an institution's obligation to provide applicants with copies of
collateral evaluations on residential properties as required by amended provisions of regulations implementing
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 
Commenters, responding to the FCA's ``Regulatory Burden'' notice, requested clarification as to the appropriateness
of providing time limits on how long an applicant can delay a credit reconsideration while waiting for the completion
of an independent appraisal. The FCA believes that this is a valid concern, which should be addressed by a revision
to the regulation to require the completion of the evaluation within a reasonable timeframe, depending on the nature
and complexity of the appraisal assignment. 
The FCA has also noted that the Federal Reserve Board's amendment of Regulation B, the regulations that implement
the ECOA, requires that System institutions provide copies of collateral evaluation reports, containing all pertinent
information, to unsuccessful applicants for credit that would have been secured by residential real property. Therefore,
the FCA's current regulations pertaining to the release of information must be revised to expressly permit the release
of collateral evaluation information when required by the provisions of the ECOA and related regulations. The ECOA
regulations generally require the institution, in the case of residential properties, to provide the applicant
a copy of the complete evaluation report including any third-party information if it is used as part of the institution's
evaluation process. 
System institutions should note that, in those cases where disclosure of such collateral evaluations is required
by the ECOA, there is no protection for confidential 
third-party information. Therefore, System institutions should avoid the use of such confidential information
where disclosure is likely under the ECOA (i.e., loans secured by residential properties, including farmland loans
where a dwelling is taken as part of the security). Confidential third-party information does not include information
that would otherwise be publicly available (e.g., contained in the public land records). 


G. Other Comments 


Several commenters have expressed concerns with the level of requirements and standards for collateral valuations
on real estate and, in particular, the requirements for personal property valuations and the use of the income approach
for evaluations. The commenters objected to requirements they felt were not consistent with the requirements imposed
by the other regulators on their regulated banking institutions.

<DOCNO> FR940912-0-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently recommended that the bank and thrift Federal regulatory
agencies establish a set of minimum standards for real estate evaluations where the use of State-sanctioned appraisers
and compliance with USPAP are not required.

14

 The FCA, by previously adopting and publishing the requirements of  614.4250 of the regulations, has addressed
similar concerns for the System institutions' valuation of real, personal, and intangible property in general.






In addition, the OCC has recently published proposed revisions to its lending limit regulations that would require
appraisals/evaluations of collateral used to secure loans where the lender requires collateral (including personal
property) to support lending in excess of the 
15-percent lending limit. This position is also consistent with the regulatory standards and guidance previously
established by the FCA in the collateral evaluation regulations. The FCA's willingness to adopt a 
25-percent lending limit for FCBs and direct lender associations is supported by the recognition that collateral
evaluation requirements serve as an essential control (58 FR 40311, July 28, 1993). 

The FCA has also reviewed concerns previously expressed by the System, which pertain to the required use of the income
approach for real estate evaluations in excess of the de minimis 

level (whether an appraisal is required or not). The FCA has clarified in the regulations that the income approach
is one of the three prescribed methods of valuing collateral under USPAP. Therefore, whenever USPAP standards are
employed the income approach must be considered. If it is not used as a valuation method, there must be an explanation
of why it was not used, accompanied by the development of the initial income-producing information to support its
lack of relevance as a valuation method. 

In  614.4265(d) the FCA requires the institution to develop and document, as part of the supporting information
for the credit analysis, the income-producing capacity of the subject real estate as well as the operations of the
business. This information may or may not be derived directly from the real estate evaluation process, but is required
as part of the credit analysis to support the debt repayment analysis. Such information is intended to assist in identifying
debt coverage shortages that must be addressed by other sources of income. However, the FCA strongly suggests that
the income approach be used on agricultural properties where the loan transaction exceeds the $250,000 

de minimis 

level. 
The income analysis requirement contained in the regulation does not apply to loan transactions at the $250,000 

de minimis 

level and below. However, prudent business practices may dictate the development and use of such information in a
much wider range of loan transactions. The institutions have the responsibility to identify those instances where
the credit risk and the associated credit decision would require the support of the income and debt coverage analysis.



V. Summary 


The present revisions of the FCA collateral evaluation requirements will benefit the System institutions by allowing
them to enjoy a competitive playing field with the commercial banking industry and relieving some requirements that
have been identified as burdensome and unnecessary. The FCA Board believes that these revisions can be made without
undermining the basic collateral evaluation requirements or jeopardizing safety and soundness. Therefore, the
FCA Board is able to increase the flexibility of the regulations in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency
of the System's collateral evaluation practices.

 when used to describe decisions to require collateral, means that the collateral is taken in circumstances in which:


(1) It is not required by statute, regulation, or the institution's policies; and

and the decision to extend credit was, in fact, based on other sources of revenue or collateral. 

(b) 

Appraisal

 means a written statement independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion
as to the market value of an adequately described property as of a specific date(s), supported by the presentation
and analysis of relevant market information.

with the contracting institution. In addition, for purposes of personal and intangible collateral evaluations,
the term ``fee appraiser'' includes, but is not limited to, certified public accountants, equipment dealers, grain

ownership. This value is derived from either: 

(1) Capitalizing a single year's income expectancy or an annual average of several years' income expectancies at
a market-derived capitalization rate that reflects a specific income pattern, return on investment, and change
in the value of the investment; or 

(2) Discounting the annual cashflows for the holding period and the reversion at a specified yield rate or specified
yield rates which reflect market behavior. 

(l) 

Market value

 means the most probable price that a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite
to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and assuming neither is under duress. Implicit

securities. 

(q) 

Real property

 means all interests, benefits, and rights inherent in the ownership of real estate. 

(r) 

Sales comparison approach

 means the procedure that values property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located in relatively
close proximity, having similar size and utility, and having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable
sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate the degree of similarity and difference
between the subject property and comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of conditions of sale,
financing terms, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities
of the subject property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property could be sold on the date of the collateral
evaluation. 

(s) 

State certified appraiser

 means any individual who has satisfied the requirements for and has been certified as a real estate appraiser by a State
or territory whose requirements for certification currently meet or exceed the minimum criteria for certification

 614.4245

 Collateral evaluation policies. 


(a) The board of directors of each Farm Credit System institution that engages in lending or leasing secured by collateral
shall adopt well-defined and effective collateral evaluation policies and standards, that comply with the regulations
in this subpart, to ensure that collateral evaluations are: 
(1) Sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide ample support to the institution's related credit decisions;

(2) Performed based on criteria established for the purpose of determining the circumstances under which collateral
evaluations will be required and when they will be required. Such criteria must, at a minimum: 
(i) Establish when an institution will require a collateral appraisal completed under the USPAP rather than a collateral
valuation; and 
(ii) Take into account such factors as market trends, market volatility, and various types of credit, loan servicing,
collection, and liquidation actions; and 
(3) Completed by a qualified evaluator in an unbiased manner. 
(b) The policies and standards required by this section shall, at a minimum, address the criteria outlined in   614.4250
through 614.4267 of this subpart. 
(c) A Federal land bank association shall, with the approval of its respective Farm Credit bank, adopt collateral
evaluation policies that are consistent with the bank's policies and standards. 


 614.4250

 Collateral evaluation standards. 


(a) When real, personal, or intangible property is taken as security for a loan or is the subject of a lease, an evaluation
of such property shall be performed in accordance with  614.4260 and the institutions' policies and procedures.
Such a collateral evaluation shall be identified as either a collateral valuation or a collateral appraisal. Specifically,
all collateral evaluations must: 
(1) Value the subject property based upon market value as defined in  614.4240(l); 
(2) Be presented in a written format; 
(3) Consider the purpose for which the property will be used and the property's highest and best use, if different from
the intended use; 
(4) Be sufficiently descriptive to enable the reader to ascertain the reasonableness of the estimated market value
and the rationale for the estimate; 
(5) Provide sufficient detail (including an identification and description of the property) and depth of analysis
to reflect the relevant characteristics and complexity of the subject property; 
(6) Analyze and report, as appropriate, for real, intangible, and/or personal property, on: 
(i) The current income producing capacity of the property; 
(ii) A reasonable marketing period for the property; 
(iii) The current market conditions and trends that will affect projected income, to the extent such conditions will
affect the value of the property; 
(iv) The appropriate deductions and discounts as they would apply to the property, including but not limited to, those
based on the condition of the property, as well as the specialization of the operation and property; and 
(v) Potential liabilities, including those associated with any hazardous waste or other environmental concerns;
and 
(7) Include in the evaluation report a certification that the evaluation was not based on a requested minimum valuation
or specific valuation or approval of a loan. 
(b) For purposes of determining appraisal value as required in section 1.10(a) of the Act, the definition of market
value and the requirements of this subpart shall apply. 


 614.4255

<TEXT>
 

(i) The transaction does not involve the advancement of new loan funds other than funds necessary to cover reasonable

to determine market value; 
(2) Explains and documents the elimination of any approach not used. 
(3) Reconciles the market values of the applicable approaches; and 
(c) Where real estate appraisals or real estate collateral valuations for business loans in excess of $250,000 that

with the USPAP and shall include a legal description of the subject property. 
(d) At a minimum, the institution shall develop and document the evaluation of the income and debt servicing capacity
for the property and operation where the transaction value exceeds $250,000 and the real estate taken as collateral:

(2) Is not an integral part of and does not support the principal source of loan repayment, but has demonstrable rental
market appeal, is statutorily required, and fully or partially constitutes an integral part of an agricultural or
aquatic operation. 
(e) The income-earning and debt-servicing capacity established under paragraph (d) of this section on such properties
shall be documented as part of the credit analysis for any related loan action, whether or not the income capitalization
approach value is used as the basis for the market value conclusion stated in the evaluation report. 
(f) Collateral closely aligned with, an integral part of, and normally sold with real estate (fixtures) may be included
in the value of the real estate. All other collateral associated with the real estate, but designated as personal property,
shall be evaluated as personal property in accordance with   614.4250 and 614.4266. 
(g) The evaluation shall properly identify all nonagricultural influences, including, but not limited to, urban
development, mineral deposits, and commercial building development value, and the reasoning supporting the evaluator's
highest and best-use conclusion.

 Professional association membership; competency. 


(a) 

Membership in appraisal organizations.

Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide and Consolidated Bank 
Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the FCA 
Board, adopts new final regulations governing the Farm 
Credit System's (FCS or System) preparation and reporting of 
Systemwide financial information to investors. The final 
rule requires that each bank of the System, the Federal Farm 
Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation), and 
the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation 
(Financial Assistance Corporation) jointly publish periodic 
reports to investors and potential investors in Systemwide 
debt obligations and consolidated bank debt obligations of 
the Farm Credit System (FCS debt obligations). 


The purpose of the rule is to ensure that timely and 
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
System institutions. The required report to investors must 
present Systemwide combined financial statements, 
supplemental financial statement information, and related 
analyses pertaining to System institutions on a combined 
basis. The final rule covers Systemwide financial and non-financial information now regularly disclosed by the
Funding 
Corporation in annual and quarterly information statements 
and press releases. 
The final regulations generally parallel the existing 
Farm Credit System Disclosure Program (System Disclosure 
Program) and should not impose any significant additional 
burdens on System institutions. Consistent with the System 
Disclosure Program, the final rule preserves the existing 
reporting relationship between a System bank and its related 
associations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Under the System Disclosure Program, the Funding 
Corporation, on behalf of the System, periodically 
distributes to investors a disclosure document containing 
Systemwide financial information. The System institutions 
that participate in the System Disclosure Program (

i.e.,

 
each of the System banks, the Funding Corporation, and the 
Financial Assistance Corporation
) jointly publish the 
Report to Investors of the Farm Credit System (FCS Report) 
on an annual basis. The FCS Report includes an Information 
Statement and a general report. The Information Statement 
contains combined financial statements and related analyses 
pertaining to all System institutions. The general report 
contains other information about the System, its debt 
obligations, and the environment in which it operates. 
Except for the quarter that coincides with the end of the 
fiscal year, System institutions also jointly publish a 
quarterly Information Statement. In connection with the 
sale of debt securities, the Funding Corporation routinely 
distributes the FCS Report and quarterly Information 
Statement to the investment dealers and dealer banks 
(selling group) that sell FCS debt securities. The FCA 
currently has no regulations that specifically govern the 
System's disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
investors.

II. Statutory Authority and Proposed Rulemaking 


Under section 5.17(a)(8) of the Farm Credit Act of 
1971, as amended (1971 Act), 12 U.S.C. 2252(a)(8), the FCA 
is authorized to ``Regulate the preparation by System 
institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and 
investors of information on the financial condition and 
operations of such institutions. * * *'' On February 4, 
1994, the FCA proposed regulations for a new part 630, 
Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide and Consolidated Bank 
Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System, to govern the 
System's preparation and reporting of Systemwide financial 
information to investors. (59 FR 5341) In general, the 
proposed regulations reflected the current division of 
responsibilities among the institutions participating in the 
System Disclosure Program, and included requirements for 
disclosures similar to those contained in the Information 
Statements currently published by the System. The 
institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program 
were designated as the ``disclosure entities'' in the proposed 
regulations, in recognition of their shared responsibility 
for disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
investors and the general public. 


III. Discussion of the Final Rule and Summary of Public 
Comments 


The FCA is adopting part 630 largely as proposed. The 
final rule includes changes and clarifications to address 
comments received on the proposed rule. As in the proposed 
regulations, the final regulations (1) Require the System to 
publish annual and quarterly reports to investors; 
(2) delineate responsibilities relating to the preparation 
of the report; (3) reinforce internal controls over 
Systemwide financial disclosure; and (4) establish reporting 
standards for the report to ensure that relevant information 
concerning the combined financial condition and results of 
operations of the System is disclosed to investors and 
potential investors. The final rule will prevent any 
inconsistency between Systemwide disclosure to investors and 
FCA regulations governing accounting and reporting standards 
and individual System institution disclosure to 
shareholders. These new FCA regulations will apply to the 
information currently contained in the System's Information 
Statements and press releases that contain Systemwide 
financial information. The final rule also implements 
section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety 
and Soundness Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-552 (1992 Act), which 
requires adequate disclosure to investors of financial and 
conflict-of-interest information. 
The final regulations will ensure that timely and 
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
System institutions. This is consistent with the FCA 
Board's regulatory policy to ``Protect the public, the 
investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an 
effort to create an environment whereby 
customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of 
the System's strength and rely on its future viability with 
confidence.'' (

FCA Board Policy Statement on Regulatory 
Philosophy, 59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994) 
The FCA received six comment letters on the proposed 
regulations during the comment period, which expired on 
April 20, 1994. One letter was submitted by the Farm Credit 
Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership. The FCC comments 
were the product of input from a number of sources, 
including System banks, the System's Accounting Standards 
Work Group, and the Funding Corporation. The FCC recognized 
and concurred with the FCA's efforts to ensure that timely 
and accurate Systemwide financial information continues to 
be disclosed to investors and potential investors in FCS 
debt securities. Noting the System's general support for 
the proposed regulations, the FCC submitted comments on 
several provisions of the proposed regulations in the body 
of its letter and provided technical comments on other 
provisions in an attached appendix. 
The Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Bank of Texas 
(FCBT), and the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore (FCBB) each 
submitted a letter addressing specific issues. The Funding 
Corporation commented concerning its access to FCA 
Examination Reports of System banks and associations. The 
FCBT addressed the same issue in its letter. In addition, 
the FCBT urged that the FCA prohibit directors of System 
institutions from serving on the System Audit Committee. 
While endorsing the comments submitted by the FCC, the FCBB 
urged that the FCA clarify, for purposes of Systemwide 
disclosure, the treatment of the FCBB's wholly-owned 
subsidiary, the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto 
Rico. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(AICPA) and Price Waterhouse, the external auditor currently 
engaged to provide an opinion on the Systemwide combined 
financial statements, also commented on the proposed 
regulations. Both of these commenters suggested that the 
requirements for an accountant's opinion on supplemental 
information be clarified. The AICPA also commented on 
issues concerning the definition of ``material,'' the due 
dates of the reports to investors, and the requirement for 
filing a letter with the FCA explaining the preferability of 
an accounting change.

After the FCA published the proposed rule, the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report entitled ``Farm 
Credit System: Repayment of Federal Assistance and 
Competitive Position'' (GAO/GGD-94-39, dated March 10, 1994), 
which recommended that the FCA require the System to exclude 
the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) from the 
System's combined financial statements because of the GAO's 
view that exclusion is the most appropriate accounting 
treatment. On May 10, 1994, the FCA responded to the GAO's 
recommendation in a letter to Congressional committees which 
described the FCA's approach to Insurance Fund reporting as 
reflected in this rulemaking. The final regulations require 
that the System prepare the Systemwide combined financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP), provide supplemental financial statement 
data with and without the Insurance Fund, and give a 
thorough discussion and analysis of the fund in the report 
to investors. The FCA believes that these regulations, as 
adopted, will ensure that investors are provided with 
meaningful information regarding the Insurance Fund and the 
effect of the fund on the System's financial position. 
Provided below are a section-by-section analysis of 
changes to the proposed rule and FCA responses to the 
comments received. 


IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of Public Comments 


A. Section 630.2_Definitions 


1. Section 630.2(b) and (h)_Definitions of ``Combined 
Financial Statements'' and ``Systemwide Combined Financial 
Statements'' 


For preparation of the Systemwide combined financial 
statements, the final rule requires that each bank provide 
the Funding Corporation with bank-only financial data as 
well as with combined financial data of the bank and its 
related associations. The FCC and the FCBB commented that 
the proposed regulations should be clarified to address how 
the consolidated financial data of a bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be reported in the Systemwide

disclosure. 
To distinguish financial data prepared on a combined 
basis from that prepared on a consolidated basis, a new 
definition of ``combined financial statements'' has been added 
in  630.2(b) of the final rule. The definition is added to 
clarify that combined financial statements are prepared by a 
group of affiliated entities that share the same financial 
interest regardless of whether any of the entities has the 
ability to exercise control over another. In contrast, 
consolidated financial statements are prepared by a parent-entity to include the financial data of subsidiaries
that 
are under its ``control.'' 
To prevent this newly added definition of ``combined 
financial statements'' from being confused with the 
definition of ``Systemwide combined financial statements'' 
contained in  630.2(g) of the proposed rule, proposed 
 630.2(g) has been simplified to define ``Systemwide 
combined financial statements'' as the combined financial 
statements required by this part. Proposed  630.2(g) also 
is redesignated as  630.2(h). The proposed language 
specifying the purpose for which the Systemwide combined 
financial statements are prepared has been moved and 
combined with provisions pertinent to financial statements 
in  630.20(l). 


2. Proposed Definition of ``Material'' 


Section 630.2(f) of the proposed regulations provided a 
definition of ``material'' similar to that found in Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 405. The FCA received 
two comments on the proposed definition of ``material.'' The 
AICPA asserted that defining ``material'' other than as 
established in accounting literature would be confusing and 
inconsistent if audits of the Systemwide combined financial 
statements are required to be performed in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The AICPA 
recommended either deleting the proposed definition of 
``material'' or amending it to refer to the materiality 
definition in GAAS or in Financial Accounting Standards 
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2, 
Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information (FAC 
No. 2). 
The FCA notes that the definition of ``material'' in the 
proposed rule was intended to govern information presented 
outside the basic financial statements.

2

 Regardless of the 
proposed definition, the Systemwide combined financial 
statements required by this part are subject to materiality 
criteria established in GAAP. Specifically, pursuant to 
 630.3(c),

3

 the Systemwide combined financial statements 
must be prepared in accordance with the accounting and 
reporting standards set forth in part 621 of this chapter. 
Because  621.2(g) defines the term ``material'' in accordance 
with FAC No. 2, the GAAP definition of ``material'' contained 
in part 621 of this chapter will govern the System's 
preparation of Systemwide combined financial statements. 
Consequently, materiality judgments for preparation of the 
Systemwide combined financial statements must be made in 
accordance with GAAP.

<TEXT>
 

The FCC recommended that the proposed definition of 
``material'' be expanded to recognize the different levels of 
reporting and disclosure responsibilities of the System 
banks and the Funding Corporation. The FCC suggested two 
separate definitions of ``material.'' One of the suggested 
definitions would apply to the Banks' reporting 
responsibilities to the Funding Corporation and the second 
would apply to the Funding Corporation's disclosure 
responsibilities on a Systemwide basis as subject to 
antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. 
Under GAAP, individual materiality judgments are made 
on a case-by-case basis and materiality is measured at each 
reporting level in light of surrounding circumstances. The 
GAAP position is supported by FAC No. 2 and recognizes that 
no general standards of materiality could be formulated to 
take into account all the considerations that enter into an 
experienced human judgment. In line with this approach to 
the concept of materiality, the FCA believes that it is 
unnecessary to include, as suggested by the FCC, two 
separate definitions of ``material.'' 
Materiality judgments regarding information presented 
outside the financial statements, while not covered by the 
GAAP definition, are governed by current standards of 
materiality under the securities laws.
 The FCA believes 
that the case law standard of materiality provides 
sufficient guidance to the System in preparing information 
to be presented outside the financial statements. To avoid 
any confusion between the GAAP materiality standard which 
governs preparation of the financial statements, and the 
standard of materiality enunciated in the case law, which 
governs information presented outside of the financial 
statements, the proposed definition of ``material'' has been 
eliminated from the final rule. 





3. Section 630.2(g)_Definition of ``Report to Investors'' 


The FCC commented that, although the preamble clarifies 
that the term ``report to investors'' used throughout the 
proposed rule is intended to mean the Information Statement 
currently published by the Funding Corporation, confusion 
exists as to whether the term refers to the FCS Report or 
the Information Statement. Because the FCS Report currently 
prepared by the Funding Corporation contains certain 
information that is not part of the System Disclosure 
Program, and for which System banks are not responsible, the 
FCC suggested that all references to the ``report to 
investors'' in the regulation be replaced with the term 
``Information Statement.'' 
The FCA does not intend to regulate the name of the 
report required by this part. The term ``report to 
investors'' used in the proposed rule is merely a general 
reference to the disclosure document required by this part. 
However, in response to the FCC's comment, a new definition 
of ``report to investors'' has been added as  630.2(g) of the 
final rule to clarify that the term ``report to investors'' 
referred to in the regulations means ``a report that presents 
the Systemwide combined financial statements, supplemental 
financial statement information, and related financial and 
nonfinancial information pertaining to the System required 
by this part.'' Under this provision, a document containing 
only information that is not required by this part and that 
is clearly identified as separate from the required report 
will not be subject to this final rule.

B. Section 630.3_Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors



1. Section 630.3(a) 



The FCA received two comments on  630.3(a), which establishes the due dates for publishing the annual and quarterly
reports to investors. The FCC opined that the word ``publish'' in  630.3(a) is subject to interpretation, and
could mean printed, mailed, or received by the investors. The commenter suggested that the word ``publish'' be replaced
with the phrase ``make available.'' 

Section 630.3(a) requires not only that the System ``make available'' the report to investors by the dates specified
in  630.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) but that the System take affirmative steps to distribute the report to investors.
One such step, as noted in the rule proposal, is distribution of sufficient copies of the report to the selling group
dealers for subsequent distribution to interested investors. The FCA believes that the suggested substitution
of the phrase ``make available'' may discourage exploration of other report distribution techniques and, accordingly,
has retained the word ``publish'' in  630.3(a). 

The AICPA also commented on  630.3(a), suggesting that the FCA reconsider whether the due dates prescribed
in  630.3(a) provide sufficient time for preparation of the combined information from various entities within
the System. The FCA believes that the due dates established in  630.3(a) for publishing and filing an annual
report within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year and a quarterly report within 60 days after the end of each reporting
quarter are adequate. The 90-day requirement for publishing the annual report to investors is consistent with industry
practice. The 60-day requirement for publishing the quarterly report permits the Funding Corporation to publish
the report 15 days after the constituent System banks and associations have filed their quarterly reports with the
FCA pursuant to part 620 of this chapter. In addition, in the event the Funding Corporation is unable to prepare and
publish the report to investors because one or more banks fail to fulfill their responsibilities for providing information
to the Funding Corporation in accordance with  630.4(c),  630.4(a)(7) authorizes the Funding Corporation
to request the FCA to extend the due date for publishing the report to investors. Accordingly, the FCA has adopted the
due dates established in  630.3(a) as proposed. 



2. Section 630.3(f)_Banks' Joint and Several Liability for Consolidated Bank Debt Obligations 



Section 630.3(f) requires that each report to investors include a statement that Systemwide debt securities and
consolidated bank debt obligations are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The FCC questioned the
statutory basis for this required statement as regards individual bank joint and several liability for consolidated
bank debt obligations. The FCC requested that the FCA provide a legal analysis of the statutory basis and extend the
comment period for this provision. 

The FCA believes that no extensive analysis is required to justify the position that consolidated bank debt obligations
are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The basis for this disclosure is found in section 4.4 of the
1971 Act, which clearly establishes joint and several liability of all banks for consolidated and Systemwide debt
regardless of the title of the 1971 Act under which the bank operates. The FCA notes that the 75-day comment period on
these regulations included a 30-day extension of the original comment period and believes that another extension
of the comment period is unnecessary. The FCA has adopted  630.3(f) as proposed. 



C. Section 630.4_Responsibilities for Preparing the Report to Investors 



1. Section 630.4(a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9)_Report of Examination 



Proposed  630.4(a)(9) authorizes the Funding Corporation to make a request to the FCA regarding the content
of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks and related associations if the information is necessary for preparation
of the report to investors. Two System institutions_the Funding Corporation and the FCBT_commented on the proposed
provision.

The Funding Corporation suggested that the regulation be expanded so that, upon its request, each bank would be required
to provide the Funding Corporation with the Reports of Examination and related information for the bank and related
associations. The Funding Corporation is concerned that the regulation as proposed may be interpreted to implicitly
absolve a bank of its responsibility to report to the Funding Corporation any significant regulatory conditions
imposed or actions taken by the FCA against the bank or its related associations. 

Conversely, the FCBT supported proposed  630.4(a)(9) as written on the basis that it maintains an appropriate
balance between the confidentiality of examination reports required by  602.205 of this chapter and the need
to provide complete and accurate disclosure to investors required by the proposed rule. Section 630.4(c) sets forth
the responsibilities of each bank for preparation of the report to investors. Based on  630.4(c)(5)(i), which
requires that each bank certify to the Funding Corporation that the bank has submitted all information needed for
preparation of the report to investors in accordance with the instruction of the Funding Corporation, the FCBT concluded
that protection of the confidentiality of examination reports will not encourage banks to avoid their primary disclosure
responsibilities with respect to material matters that may be discussed in the examination report. 
While the FCBT supports  630.4(a)(9) as proposed, it commented that the phrase ``if necessary'' leaves doubt
as to whether the Funding Corporation should request the FCA to provide information contained in the examination
reports in all cases or simply in those cases where a bank does not provide information contained in the examination
report to the Funding Corporation. The FCBT requested that the FCA provide a definitive and unambiguous rule regarding
the obligation to furnish copies of these reports. 

In response to the comments received, the FCA has revised paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9) of  630.4
to clarify that the Funding Corporation is responsible for collecting from each disclosure entity information needed
for preparation of the report to investors, including any information that is material to a single disclosure entity.
Likewise, in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions, each bank is responsible for providing the
Funding Corporation with information that is material either to the bank or, on a combined basis, to the bank and its
related associations. If information necessary for preparation of a report to investors that is meaningful and not
misleading is not forthcoming from a bank in accordance with the provisions of  630.4(c), the Funding Corporation
may request the FCA to provide information regarding the content of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks
or related associations necessary to ensure that the information presented in the report to investors is meaningful
and not misleading. The FCA will then make a determination whether to provide the Funding Corporation with relevant
information contained in the Report of Examination or, if appropriate, the entire report. 

The FCA is cognizant of both the Funding Corporation's desire to have direct access to Reports of Examination and the
FCBT's concern with protection of the confidentiality of the Reports of Examination. The FCA does not believe that
 630.4(a)(9) would relieve a bank of its responsibility to report any significant regulatory conditions that
would have a material impact on the information being presented in the report to investors. It remains the primary
responsibility of each bank to provide accurate and complete information to the Funding Corporation for preparing
disclosure to investors. Each bank is required to certify to this effect to the Funding Corporation. 

Section 630.4(a)(9) is established to provide the Funding Corporation with a contingency source for obtaining information
needed to prepare accurate and comprehensive annual and quarterly reports to investors, while maintaining the confidentiality
of the Reports of Examination. However, such requests from the Funding Corporation to the FCA are expected to be rare.
Also, as the FCBT noted in its comment letter,  630.5 prohibits banks from making incomplete, inaccurate, or
misleading disclosures. Failure to disclose material information would violate these regulations and subject
a bank and its officers and directors to possible FCA enforcement action. 



2. Sections 630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)_Bank-Only Financial Data 



Section 630.4(c)(1) requires that each bank provide the Funding Corporation with information needed for preparation
of the report to investors. The FCC suggested that proposed  630.4(c)(1) be revised to clarify that, for Systemwide
disclosure, information to be provided by each bank to the Funding Corporation includes not only financial information,
but nonfinancial information as well, including information covering structural changes and regulatory enforcement
activity. Proposed  630.4(c)(1) has been clarified to refer to other nonfinancial information. 

The FCC also suggested that proposed   630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)(i) be revised to clarify that it
is appropriate to include any wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank in the bank-only information. The FCBB submitted
a separate comment in which it urged the FCA to include the FCC's suggestion in the final rule to address the treatment
of the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the FCBB.

<PARENT> FR940912-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To address the concerns raised by the commenters 
regarding a bank's reporting of consolidated financial data 
in Systemwide disclosure, the FCA has removed the wording 
``bank-only'' from  630.4(c)(1) and clarified that, if a bank 
is required to prepare consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, it is appropriate that the bank 
provide consolidated financial data of the bank and its 
consolidated subsidiaries to the Funding Corporation. 
Conforming changes were also made to  630.20(m)(3) and 
Appendix A of the final rule. 



3. Section 630.4(d)_Responsibilities of Associations 



Proposed  630.4(d) provides the banks with access to 
their related associations' auditors for preparation of the 
report to investors. The FCC commented that the banks 
sometimes may need to have access to others, such as legal 
counsel. To ensure that the banks have the ability to 
obtain any information necessary to accurately prepare their 
submission to the Funding Corporation, the FCC suggested 
that the regulation include a general statement that the 
banks may have access to any material association 
information. Under sections 2.2 and 2.12 of the 1971 Act, 
each association is subject to supervision by its related 
bank. Each Farm Credit Bank is responsible for preparing 
the combined financial statements of the bank and related 
associations for disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
620 of this chapter. Part 620 of this chapter does not, 
however, specify how the disclosure responsibilities between 
banks and related associations are shared. To clarify this 
issue for purposes of part 630, the FCA has expanded 
proposed  630.4(d) by adding a general statement in  
630.4(d)(1) of the final rule to require that each 
association provide its related bank with the information 
necessary to allow the bank to provide accurate and complete 
information to the Funding Corporation for preparation of 
the report to investors. The original text of proposed  
630.4(d) has been redesignated as  630.4(d)(2). 



D. Section 630.5_Prohibition Against Incomplete, 
Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure 



The FCC suggested that the FCA clarify that  630.5 
concerning prohibition against incomplete, inaccurate, or 
misleading disclosure would apply only when the defective 
disclosure is material. Since compliance with the 
disclosure standards of this part is generally subject to a 
materiality test in any event, the FCA finds it unnecessary 
to add the suggested materiality language to  630.5 and has 
adopted this section as proposed. 



E. Section 630.6_System Audit Committee and Bank Audit 
Committees 



1. Section 630.6(a)(2) 



Under  630.6(a)(2), officers or employees of a System 
institution are prohibited from serving on the System Audit 
Committee (SAC) because they are not independent of 
management. The FCBT urged the FCA to prohibit System 
directors from serving on the SAC due to potential conflicts 
of interest based on competition between System 
institutions. 

The FCA believes that the suggested prohibition would 
be disruptive to the existing SAC and force the Funding 
Corporation to recruit SAC members from outside the System. 
In addition, the FCA views the FCBT's argument as relating 
less to conflict of interest than to concern regarding 
preservation of the confidentiality of information reviewed 
by the SAC. Under section 4.9 of the 1971 Act, directors 
and management of System institutions are eligible to serve 
on the board of the Funding Corporation. As a practical 
matter, any information available to SAC members is equally 
available to the members of the board of the Funding 
Corporation. Thus, precluding System directors from serving 
on the SAC would not necessarily prevent confidential 
information from being exposed to directors of other System 
banks. In light of these considerations, the FCA is 
adopting the rule as proposed but will monitor SAC 
activities for apparent inappropriate use of information. 
Finally, the FCA notes that  630.6(a) does not prevent the 
Funding Corporation board from adopting a policy to 
disqualify System directors from serving on the SAC. 



2. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iii) 



The FCC commented that the word ``approve'' contained in 
 630.6(a)(4)(iii) of the proposed rule implies that the SAC 
has the authority to dictate individual bank accounting 
policies or that the Funding Corporation has the authority 
to require banks to uniformly and consistently adopt or 
change accounting policies. This was not the intent of the 
proposed rule. The primary duty of the SAC is to ensure the 
integrity of the report to investors jointly prepared by the 
Funding Corporation and System banks. The SAC is 
responsible for overseeing the reporting process and 
internal controls implemented by the Funding Corporation for 
preparation of the System's report to investors. To clarify 
that neither the SAC nor the Funding Corporation is charged 
with the responsibility for dictating individual banks' 
accounting polices, the FCA has substituted the word 
``review'' for the word ``approve'' as suggested. 



3. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iv) 



Under proposed  630.6(a)(4)(iv), the SAC is required 
to review each disclosure document containing Systemwide 
information prescribed in this part, including annual 
reports, quarterly reports, and press releases, prior to its 
release. The FCC commented that the SAC's responsibility 
should pertain only to financial information and disclosures 
contained in the annual information statements because the 
SAC generally would not have the expertise to review and 
evaluate nonfinancial information, such as is found in the 
description of business and description of debt securities. 
The FCC also suggested that, to facilitate timely issuance 
of quarterly information, the requirement for a review of 
each quarterly report or press release by the SAC prior to 
its release be eliminated.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940912-0-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To ensure the quality of the report to investors, the 
FCA believes that each annual or quarterly report should be 
reviewed by the SAC in its entirety. Under  630.6(a)(2), 
which provides that ``members shall be knowledgeable in 
public and corporate finance and financial reporting and 
disclosure,'' members selected to serve on the SAC should 
have the expertise to review the entire report to investors, 
including both financial and nonfinancial information. 
However, the FCA agrees that the essence of press releases 
is to provide timely release of interim information and has 
deleted the requirement for a review of press releases by 
the SAC from  630.6(a)(4)(iv). 



4. Section 630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) 



The FCC suggested that the word ``oversee'' contained in 
proposed  630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) regarding the 
responsibility of the SAC and the bank audit committee be 
replaced with the word ``review'' because the proposed wording 
implies that the audit committee would perform a management 
function in the System or the bank. The FCC also suggested 
other changes to proposed  630.6(a)(4)(v) to avoid this 
implication. 

The audit committee is commonly recognized as an entity 
established to perform an oversight function in the areas of 
financial reporting, internal control, and corporate 
governance. The word ``oversee'' contained in the proposed 
rule is consistent with the customary role of audit 
committees. The FCA has retained the word ``oversee'' in 
 630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii). The FCA notes that it is 
the responsibility of the board of each System institution 
to determine the steps the audit committee should perform to 
fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Thus, the boards of 
individual System institutions could charter their audit 
committee to review and direct management to take necessary 
corrective actions or merely to review and make corrective 
recommendations to the board. 



F. Subpart B_Annual Report to Investors 



1. Section 630.20(c)(2)_Description of Legal Proceedings 
and Enforcement Actions 



The FCC suggested that the proposed  630.20(c)(2) 
disclosure requirement for a summary of FCA enforcement 
actions against individual institutions be clarified and 
that any required discussion of the impact of the 
enforcement actions on the System's operations be linked to 
materiality. The FCA agrees with this suggestion and has 
revised the language of  630.20(c)(2) of the final rule 
accordingly. 



2. Section 630.20(d)_Description of Liabilities 



The FCC expressed the view that the information called 
for by  630.20(d)(1) regarding System debt obligations is 
too detailed and, thus, impractical. Section 
630.20(d)(1)(ii) is, in large part, based upon the 
disclosure currently furnished by the System in its 
Information Statements. Unless otherwise needed to provide 
readers of the report to investors with information needed 
to understand the characteristics of System debt, the FCA 
does not expect extensive detail regarding the 
characteristics of specific debt offerings. To clarify this 
position, the FCA has deleted the words ``terms and 
conditions'' and added prefatory language to 
 630.20(d)(1)(ii) requiring a description of debt 
obligations statutorily authorized to be issued and 
currently issued by the System, as well as other pertinent 
information. 

The FCC also requested that the regulation clearly set 
forth the option of incorporating by reference the annual 
and quarterly reports to investors into specific offering 
documents. The FCA notes that the focus of this regulation 
is on periodic reports of the System to investors. It does 
not govern offering circulars or specific offering 
documents. Nothing in this regulation precludes the System 
from incorporating by reference information contained in the 
annual or quarterly reports to investors into specific 
offering documents if otherwise appropriate. 



3. Section 630.20(g)(1)_Loan Portfolio 



Proposed  630.20(g)(1)(ii) required disclosure of the 
amount of loans outstanding that were used to finance the 
purchases of stock or other equities of System institutions. 

The FCC expressed concern regarding the System's ability to 
comply with this requirement and questioned its relevance to 
investors. The FCC opined that disclosures currently 
provided by the System in its annual Information Statement 
are sufficient. The System's 1993 annual Information 
Statement states that association borrowers do not typically 
purchase capital stock for cash, but instead add the 
aggregate par value of stock to the principal amount of the 
related loan obligation. The 1993 report also provided the 
amount of capital stock and participation certificates 
outstanding at December 31, 1993. The FCC indicated that 
System compliance with the proposed requirement could only 
be on a prospective basis because System banks do not have a 
system in place to track needed information. Further, the 
FCC argued that the costs involved in complying with this 
proposed requirement would outweigh the benefits derived 
from the disclosure.

The FCA supports the commenter's view that the cost involved in providing meaningful information to investors should
not outweigh the benefits derived. The FCA also notes that  630.20(e)(2), which requires the System to ``describe
the statutory requirement that a borrower purchase stock as a condition of obtaining a loan; how such stock is purchased,
transferred, and retired; and how earnings are distributed,'' will ensure that investors continue to receive information
that describes the nature of borrower stock of the System. As a result, proposed  630.20(g)(1)(ii) has been
deleted from the final rule and proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iii) and (iv) have been redesignated. 



4. Section 630.20(g)(1)(ii)_Risk Exposure



Proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion and analysis of the risk exposure of the loan portfolio.
The FCC suggested that the term ``nonperforming loans'' replace the term ``high-risk assets'' in this section of
the regulation because it is more widely used in the commercial banking industry. Use of the term ``high-risk assets''
in proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iii) is consistent with the recent amendment of the FCA's accounting and reporting
guidelines in part 621 of this chapter. See 58 FR 48780 (September 20, 1993). In the FCA's regulations, the term ``high-risk
assets'' is a generic reference to loans and loan-related assets that are to be categorized for loan performance and
valuation assessment purposes according to the criteria set forth in  621.6 of this chapter. Collectively,
the classifications identified in  621.6 of this chapter are consistent with the terminology used in the commercial
banking industry for nonperforming loans. There is no regulatory requirement to categorize the classification
as ``high-risk assets'' in the report to investors. Rather, proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion
of any risks that could adversely affect the loan portfolio and loan-related assets. Accordingly, the FCA has retained
the term ``high-risk assets'' and adopted  630.20(g)(1)(iii) essentially as proposed. Proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iii)
is redesignated as  630.20(g)(1)(ii). The FCA further notes that it expects to revisit the issue of accounting
for impaired loans in the future to assess the impact of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, issued by the Financial and Accounting Standards Board.



5. Section 630.20(g)(1)(iii)_Secondary Market Activities



The FCC commented that secondary market activities have never been and currently are not anticipated to be material
to the System's financial condition. The FCC suggested that proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iv) be modified to require
these activities to be described when they become material to the System's financial condition. The FCA agrees with
the commenter that the System's involvement in the secondary markets should be disclosed to investors when the effect
of such activities on the financial condition of the System is material and has revised proposed  630.20(g)(1)(iv)
to add materiality tests. This provision is redesignated as  630.20(g)(1)(iii) of the final rule.

The FCA believes that the System's statutory authority to participate in secondary markets should be disclosed to
investors in any event. A new paragraph has thus been added in  630.20(a)(1)(vi) of the final rule to require,
without regard to materiality, a description of the authority of System institutions to purchase and sell interests
in loans in secondary markets and the risk involved. 




6. Section 630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii)_Liquidity and Investment



Section  630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii) require that the System provide a brief description of the System's policies
regarding liquidity and investment. The FCC pointed out that each System bank adopts its own liquidity and investment
policies according to its business objectives. In the absence of universal policies regarding investment and liquidity
among System institutions, the commenter suggested that the proposed regulations be revised to require only a general
description of System banks' policies. The suggested change is consistent with the intent of the proposed regulations.
The FCA has clarified the proposed regulations by revising  630.20(g)(3)(ii)(A) and (g)(3)(iii) to require
a brief overview of liquidity and investment matters.

7. Section 630.20(g)(3)(iv)_Interest Rate Sensitivity 


Section 630.20(g)(3)(iv) requires a general description of the System's risk management practices, including
a brief discussion of derivative transactions. Due to the heightened interest of the public, financial institution
regulators, and Congress in this area, the FCA solicited comments on whether disclosure requirements regarding
derivative activities should be more detailed. The FCC suggested that, given the changing GAAP environment for derivative
transactions, the FCA consider the approach to derivatives activity regulation used by other bank regulators. This
approach requires regulated institutions to adopt policies in accordance with GAAP. The regulator provides any
clarification of GAAP or additional guidance through Call Report instructions or other mechanisms. 
The FCA adopts  630.20(g)(3)(iv) as proposed, with a clarification to provide for a ``brief overview'' of the
System's asset and liability management practices. The FCA believes that this approach to derivatives activities
disclosure is consistent with the FCC's suggestion. In addition, along with other financial institution regulators,
the FCA is monitoring the area of derivatives activities. The FCA will consider requiring more extensive disclosure
based on its assessment of the level and significance of System derivatives activities and as the need for regulatory
policy in this area becomes more clearly defined. 


8. Section 630.20(g)(5)_Insurance Fund


The FCC commented that  630.20(g)(5), which requires a discussion of the Insurance Fund in the Discussion and
Analysis (D&A) section of the report to investors, is unnecessary and would duplicate the disclosure contained
in the notes to the System's combined financial statements. Section 630.20(g)(5) requires a discussion of the purposes
of the Insurance Fund, a schedule itemizing Insurance Fund assets that have been identified for specific purposes,
and an explanation of how expenditures of Insurance Fund assets affect the assets and capital of the System.
The FCA does not believe that the requirement of  630.20(g)(5) will result in duplication of information in
the report. Section 630.3(e) provides that ``Information in any part of the report may be incorporated by reference
* * * to any other item of the report. Information * * * may be presented in any order deemed
suitable by the Funding Corporation.'' Accordingly, the Funding Corporation has the flexibility to determine where
the D&A regarding the Insurance Fund is to be presented. The FCA has adopted  630.20(g)(5) as proposed.
The FCA notes that the regulation does not require the D&A regarding the Insurance Fund to be audited. Pursuant
to  630.3(e), the System could opt to include the required D&A in the notes to the Systemwide combined financial
statements and incorporate the disclosure by reference into the D&A. In this situation, the required D&A
regarding the Insurance Fund would be covered in the independent accountant's report on the Systemwide combined
financial statements.


9. Section 630.20(g)(6)_Instructions for Discussion and Analysis


Proposed  630.20(g)(6)(ii) requires that discussions required by proposed  630.20(g) cover the 3-year
period covered by the financial statements. The FCC suggested that the words ``3-year'' be deleted. In recognition
that the reporting period for the balance sheet is only 2 comparative years, the FCA agrees with the commenter and has
amended  630.20(g)(6)(ii) of the final rule as suggested and revised the introductory paragraph of  630.20(g)
accordingly.


10. Section 630.20(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers 


Section 630.20(i) requires the annual report to state that information on the compensation of directors and senior
officers of System banks is contained in each bank's annual report to shareholders and that the annual report of each
bank is available to investors upon request pursuant to  630.3(f). The FCC commented that this requirement
provides no useful information to investors and is redundant.

<DOCNO> FR940912-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As stated in the rule proposal, the FCA is required by 
section 514 of the 1992 Act to ensure that the disclosure of 
financial and conflict-of-interest information by System 
personnel provides investors and potential investors with 
information necessary to assist them in making investment 
decisions regarding FCS debt obligations or institutions. 
The FCA believes that information on compensation of System 
directors and senior officers presented in individual System 
institutions' disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
620 of this chapter could provide useful information to 
investors in making investment decisions. Thus, to 
implement the requirement of section 514 of the 1992 Act, 
 630.20(i) requires that the report provide a statement 
informing investors of the availability of such information. 
The FCA adopts  630.20(i) of the final rule as proposed. 


11. Section 630.20(l) and (m)_Financial Statements and 
Supplemental Information 


Proposed  630.30(l) requires that the System prepare 
the combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP 
and instructions and other requirements of the FCA. 
Proposed  630.20(m) further requires that the System 
provide supplemental information in addition to the audited 
financial statements and that the supplemental information 
be examined by a qualified public accountant for compliance 
with FCA regulations and guidelines and an opinion expressed 
thereon. The FCA received comments on proposed  630.20(l) 
from the AICPA and the FCC and comments on proposed 
 630.20(m) from the AICPA and Price Waterhouse. 
With respect to proposed  630.20(l), both the FCC and 
the AICPA suggested, for different reasons, that the phrase 
``instructions and other requirements of the FCA'' be deleted 
from the proposed rule. The FCC was concerned that the 
proposed language indicates that regulatory accounting 
practices (RAP) may be utilized, causing investor confusion. 
On the other hand, the AICPA provided suggested language 
that would require both the basic financial statement and 
the supplemental information required by proposed 
 630.20(l) and (m) to be audited in accordance with GAAS. 
The AICPA asserted that the requirements of proposed 
 630.20(m) regarding supplemental information disclosure 
appear to comprise the ``instructions and other requirements 
of the FCA'' referred to in  630.20(l) and, further, that 
GAAS addresses auditors' reporting on information presented 
outside financial statements. 
Price Waterhouse, the external auditor of the System, 
also commented on proposed  630.20(m). Price Waterhouse 
asserted that the proposed language that ``supplemental 
information be examined by a qualified public accountant for 
compliance with FCA regulations and guidelines'' is too broad 
and would be interpreted as requiring the independent 
accountant to render a report on the System's compliance 
with all FCA regulations and guidelines. This would require 
significant work by the independent accountant. Price 
Waterhouse commented that the proposed regulatory language 
in  630.20(m) provides insufficient detail to enable the 
external auditor to determine the scope of additional work 
to be performed and the type of report to be issued by the 
auditor on the supplemental information. 
Proposed  630.20(l) was intended to preserve the FCA's 
ability to prescribe additional requirements for preparation 
and presentation of the Systemwide combined financial 
statements. However, after consideration of the comments 
received, the FCA adopts the AICPA's suggestion in the final 
rule to require that both the basic financial statements and 
the supplemental information required by  630.20(l) and (m) 
be examined in accordance with GAAS and an opinion expressed 
thereon by an independent accountant. This change will 
resolve the FCC concern regarding RAP financial statements 
and Price Waterhouse's concern regarding the scope of 
examination of supplemental information and reporting by the 
independent accountant. However, to preserve the 
flexibility to revise the format and content specified in 
Appendix A of the final rule, the FCA retains the 
requirement that supplemental information be prepared in 
accordance with any additional FCA guidance or instructions. 


12. Section 630.20(o)_Cross-Reference Sheet 


Proposed  630.20(o) called for a cross-reference sheet 
giving the location of information required by these 
regulations, in the order required, and identified by item 
numbers and captions. The FCC did not object to the 
preparation of a cross-reference sheet, but suggested that 
the cross-reference sheet would only be useful to the FCA 
and should only be required as an exhibit to copies of the 
report filed with the FCA. The FCA believes the cross 
reference to the content of the report provides useful 
information to readers of the report. To make this indexing 
requirement more useful to investors, the FCA has revised 
 630.20(o) to inform readers of the location in the report 
of the information required under the major disclosure 
captions of this part.

G. Subpart C_Quarterly Report to Investors 


Proposed  630.40(b)(5) requires that the System file a 
``preferability'' letter with the FCA disclosing any 
accounting changes made during the reporting period that are 
not required by new accounting pronouncements. The AICPA 
and the FCC commented that the requirement for filing a 
separate letter with the FCA explaining the reason for the 
preferable alternative accounting principle is unnecessary. 
They suggested that the requirement be deleted from 
 630.40(b)(5). 
The preferability letter was intended as a notice to 
inform the FCA of any accounting change made by the System 
during the interim period that is not required by existing 
accounting pronouncements. Because the quarterly report 
will be required to disclose such accounting changes, upon 
further consideration, the FCA has deleted the requirement 
of filing a preferability letter from  630.40(b)(5) of the 
final rule.

Responsibilities for preparing the report to investors. 


(a) 

Responsibilities of the Funding Corporation. 

The Funding Corporation shall:

(ii) Provide instructions to the disclosure entities regarding the information needed for preparation of the Systemwide
combined financial statements and disclosures required to be presented in the report to investors; 
(iii) Review the information submitted to it for preparation of the report to investors, and make reasonable inquiries
to ascertain whether the information is reliable, accurate, and complete; and 
(iv) Specify procedures for monitoring interim disclosures of System institutions and disclose, in a timely manner,
any material changes in information contained in the most recently published report to investors. 
(3) Collect from each disclosure entity financial data and related analyses and other information needed for preparation
of the report to investors, including any information that is material to the disclosure entity.

of this part because one or more banks have failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
A notification, signed by the officer(s) designated by the board of directors of the Funding Corporation to certify
the report to investors and by the chief executive officer, shall be made to the FCA as soon as the Funding Corporation
becomes aware of its inability to comply. The Funding Corporation shall explain the reasons for the notification
and may request that the FCA extend the due date for the report to investors.

and related associations, if such information is necessary for preparation of a report that is meaningful and not
misleading and is not forthcoming from a bank in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The request shall be
made to the Chief Examiner, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, Virginia 22102-5090.

and 

(B) The chief executive officer.

regarding the bank and its related associations to the Funding Corporation for preparation of the report. 

(2) Provide in the engagement letter with its external auditor that the external auditor of the association shall,
after notifying the association, respond to inquiries of the related bank pertaining to preparation of the combined
financial data of the association and its related bank. 



 630.5 



Prohibition against incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure. 



Neither the Funding Corporation, nor any institution supplying information to the Funding Corporation under this
part, nor any employee, officer, director, or nominee for director of the Funding Corporation or of such institutions,
shall make or cause to be made any disclosure to investors and the general public required by this part that is incomplete,
inaccurate, or misleading. When any such institution or person makes or causes to be made disclosure under this part
that, in the judgment of the FCA, is incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading, whether or not such disclosure is made
in published statements required by this part, such institution or person shall promptly furnish to the Funding Corporation,
and the Funding Corporation shall promptly publish, such additional or corrective disclosure as is necessary to
provide full and fair disclosure to investors and the general public. Nothing in this section shall prevent the FCA
from taking additional actions to enforce this section pursuant to its authority under title V, part C of the Act. 



 630.6 



Farm Credit System audit committee and bank audit committees. 



(a) 

Farm Credit System audit committee. 

(1) The board of the Funding Corporation shall establish and maintain a System Audit Committee and adopt a written
charter describing the committee's composition, authorities, and responsibilities. 

(2) The System Audit Committee shall consist of no fewer than three members. Members shall be independent of management

Subpart C_Quarterly Reports to Investors 


 630.40 


Contents of the quarterly report to investors. 


(a) 

General. 

The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material
information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.

(b) 

Rules for condensation. 

For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided
in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included
in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.

(1) 

Interim balance sheets. 

When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased
or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

(2) 

Interim statements of income. 

When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years
and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim
period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss
years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be
used for purposes of this test. 
(3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or
in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed
that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined
in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained
in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices)
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year may be omitted. 
(4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed
fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes
since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates
used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new
indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business
combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this paragraph, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided
even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred. 
(5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting
changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it. 
(6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall
be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included.
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the
initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made. 
(7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material
information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year. 
(8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material,
it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted. 
(c) 

Discussion and analysis of interim financial condition and results of operations. 

Discuss any material changes to the information disclosed to investors pursuant to  630.20(g) that have occurred
during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provide any additional information
needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the
periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

independent public accountant prior to filing. If, however, 
a review of the report is made in accordance with the 
established professional standards and procedures for such a

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD by amending this area's effective
hours to coincide with the associated control tower hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
in this area when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way
radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument
approach procedures when the control tower is closed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments on the Rule


Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. All comments should be submitted, in triplicate, to Mr. Frank Jordan at the address specified above. An informal
docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address specified above. This rule will become effective
on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that
further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule
or to amend the regulation.
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD, by amending this area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control
tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace in this area when the associated control
tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed
at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the
term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The
former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when
two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace
for instrument approach procedures when this control tower is closed.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify this Class D and establish this Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to public interest.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. it therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional Services 


<AGENCY>

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations by adopting final rules to implement, in part, those provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that provide for overtime and premium pay for Customs Officers performing
inspectional services. This document addresses the public comments submitted in response to the interim regulations
which initially implemented the pay reform provisions, and makes certain changes to those interim regulations in
response to the public comments and in order to add clarity and improve the readability of the final regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312) (the 1993 Act)
was signed into law. Part II of Subchapter D of Title XIII of the 1993 Act (107 Stat. 668)_popularly referred to as the
Customs Officer Pay Reform Amendments (COPRA)_amended section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911 (19 U.S.C. 261 and
267) to reform the overtime_and establish a premium_pay system by which Customs Officers who perform inspectional
services would be compensated. In general, while the COPRA retained the basic double-time compensation rate for
overtime services, its three sections (sections 13811-13813) made certain changes concerning how and when
such Customs Officers would be compensated. 
Section 13811 (codified, in part, at 19 U.S.C. 267) amended 19 U.S.C. 261, 267, and 1450 (and repealed 19 U.S.C. 1451a)
to create a new and exclusive overtime compensation and premium pay schedule for Customs Officers performing inspectional
services, and required the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to prevent certain abuses that developed
under the old pay system. Section 13812 amended 5 U.S.C. 8331(3) to provide additional benefits for Customs Officers;
it allows overtime compensation to be included in the calculation of Federal retirement annuities, up to an amount
equal to 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay limitation, and authorizes the payment of cash awards to Customs
Officers for foreign language proficiency. Section 13813 amended 19 U.S.C. 13031(f)(3) to make certain adjustments
concerning reimbursements from the Customs User Fee Account. 
On December 28, 1993, Customs published as T.D. 94-2 interim regulations in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68520) to implement the provisions of section 13811 of the 1993 Act. (The provisions of sections 13812 and 13813
of the 1993 Act were not dealt with in that document; the regulations implementing those aspects of the pay reform provisions
will be issued by the Office of Personnel Management and Customs at a later date.) The interim regulations amended
and revised certain sections in parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR parts 4, 24, 122, 123,
and 134) and solicited comments concerning these changes. 
Three parties submitted comments regarding one or more aspects of the interim regulations. The comments received,
and Customs responses to them, are set forth below. 


Discussion of Comments 


The comments received raised, in part, six areas of concern that will be responded to in this document: 
(1) Customs interpretation of the exclusivity clause (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)) regarding when and how shift differential
allowances would be paid (19 CFR 24.16(a)); 
(2) whether the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' precluded considerations of other,
alternative work schedules (19 CFR 24.16(b)(16)); 
(3) the propriety of defining ``work assignment priorities'' in agency regulations (19 CFR 24.16(d)); 
(4) the inclusion of workers compensation benefits in the listing of categories for which Customs Officers may receive
pay for work not performed (19 CFR 24.16(e)(2)(ii));

<PARENT> FR940912-0-00010 </PARENT>

(5) the payment of commute compensation when the overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly
scheduled assignment (19 CFR 24.16(f)(2)(v)), and; 
(6) the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from any applicable pay cap calculations (19 CFR 24.16(h)). 
Certain other issues raised by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU, one of the parties submitting comments)
are the subject of pending litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil
Action No. 94-0163, filed January 31, 1994). As it would be inappropriate for Customs to discuss those issues
at this time, those comments are not addressed in this 
document. We now address the identified areas of concern in turn. 



24.16(a)_Interpretation of exclusivity clause






Comment: 

Although the 1993 Act prohibits employees who are paid overtime under subsection (a) of the statute or premium pay
under subsection (b) of the statute from receiving ``* * * pay or other compensation for 

that work 

under any other provision of law'' (emphasis in original), the exclusivity clause contained in the 1993 Act does not
divest employees of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes for work performed during
periods for which no 1993 Act payments are received. For example, an employee may be assigned to a night shift for which
no night work differential is payable under the 1993 Act (11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). That employee should still be paid
night shift differential from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. under the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA) or other applicable
law. The interim regulations should be modified to reflect this entitlement. 


Customs Response: 

Customs disagrees. With enactment of the COPRA in the 1993 Act, Congress created a total pay and compensation system
unique to the inspectional duties performed by Customs Officers. The establishment of this new system effectively
removed those officers from coverage under any other statute for pay and compensation purposes. Accordingly, no
change to  24.16(a) is made. 
When the COPRA were promulgated, Congress reasoned that its purpose in requiring Customs Officers to work 40 hours
in a week or 8 hours in a day, without regard to the hour of the day or the day of the week, before they qualify for overtime
pay, was to encourage Customs to adjust its inspectional resources to meet actual trade patterns, rather than forcing
the trade community to adjust to a predetermined Customs workday. Also, Congress wanted Customs to measure workload
and trade patterns at each of its ports and then adjust work schedules to meet that demand while using as little overtime
as possible. See, ``Report of the Committee on the Budget House of Representatives on Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993'', Report 103-111 (May 25, 1993), p. 573. Since section 267(c)(2) clearly provides that a Customs
Officer who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) (19 U.S.C. 267(a)) or premium pay under subsection (b) (19
U.S.C. 267(b)) for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of
law, it is axiomatic that Congress' explanation in the context of overtime pay is equally applicable to the payment
of premium pay differentials, 

i.e

., night shift pay. And, as no allowance for night work differential premium pay is authorized under the Customs Officer
Pay Reform provisions where less than a majority of night work hours is worked during the specified time periods (19
U.S.C. 267(b)(1)-(3), 19 CFR 24.16(g)(3)(i)-(iii)), it is clear that the 1993 Act does divest Customs
Officers_but not other Customs employees_of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes
for work performed. Any other interpretation of section 267(c)(2) would render the express limitation meaningless.

In the scenario presented in the commenter's example, the payment of night differential premium pay is not authorized
because the Customs Officer, as defined at 19 U.S.C. 267(e)(1) and subject to the overtime and premium pay provisions
of 19 U.S.C. 267, does not work a majority of hours between any of the three time frames established by Congress for payment
of such premium pay. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(b)(1)(A) through (C). Although the Customs Officer is officially assigned
to work an 8-hour shift which goes past the, heretofore, traditional working day of 6:00 p.m., no night work differential
is authorized under the exclusivity of pay provision under the COPRA (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)); the terms of the exclusivity
provision expressly preclude dual pay/compensation entitlement considerations under other Federal pay statutes.

24.16(b)(16)_Definition of ``Regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' 





Comment:

 Regarding the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'', the following sentence should
be added, ``This section is not meant to prohibit consideration of alternative work schedules at a local level'' to
reflect the provisions of 5 CFR 610.121 and Article 21, Section 3A of the National Agreement between Customs and the
National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). 



Customs Response:

 The pay reform provisions of the 1993 Act do not affect or otherwise address the question of alternate work schedules
(AWS), which has a separate statutory basis. See, 5 U.S.C. 6120 

et seq.

 We believe that the addition of the requested sentence is unnecessary. Accordingly, no change to  24.16(b)(16)
is made. 



24.16(d)_``Work assignment priorities''/(annuity integrity) 




Comment:

 The NTEU objects to the inclusion of work assignment priorities provisions in the regulations ( 24.16(d)),
as these issues are negotiable under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. Especially objectionable is the inclusion
of the overtime earnings ``band'' in  24.16(d)(2). 



Response:

 Customs agrees that the inclusion of the equalization provision in the work assignment priorities may be overbroad
as written and could be subject to negotiations under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act; however, Customs believes
that the other two principles (alignment and least cost) are properly contained in the regulations, as they are in
accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(1), which require the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate
such regulations as will prevent the abuse of callback work assignments and commuting time compensation. Accordingly,
 24.16(d) is revised by deleting the equalization principle and replacing it with a more restricted ``annuity
integrity'' principle that is more in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2), which requires the Secretary
to promulgate such regulations as will prevent the disproportionately more frequent assignment of overtime work
to Customs Officers who are near to their retirement. 

Annuity integrity is based on the average yearly amount of overtime Customs Officers worked during their career with
Customs. Under annuity integrity the amount of overtime that can be worked by a Customs Officer who is within 3 years
of his/her statutory retirement eligibility, see, 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 or 84, is limited to the average yearly number
of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of
the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory
pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning
this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in
individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of Customs. Customs believes
that this principle of annuity integrity is in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2) and, as such,
properly belongs in the regulations. 



24.16(e)(2)(ii)_Including workers compensation benefits in list of payment categories for work not performed






Comment:

 The NTEU requests the inclusion of workers compensation benefits to the listing of categories for which Customs Officers
may receive payment for work that is not performed. 



Customs Response:

 Unlike the form of workers compensation enumerated in this section (continuation of pay under the workers compensation
law, which is paid by the employing agency), workers compensation benefits_in the form of compensation for lost wages_are
paid by the Department of Labor. See, 5 U.S.C. 8101 and 20 CFR part 10. As this latter form of workers compensation is
not within the direct control of the Secretary of the Treasury, its inclusion at  24.16(e)(2)(ii) would be inappropriate.
Accordingly, no change to  24.16(e)(2)(ii) is made.

24.16(f)(2)(v)_Payment of commute compensation





Comment:

 The commute compensation provisions include a section that a Customs Officer will not be paid for commute time if the
overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly scheduled assignment. This section makes it
extremely difficult for those inspectors that work Monday through Friday to serve the public on Saturdays and Sundays.



Customs Response:

 This eligibility condition for commute compensation is statutory. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Thus, Customs
cannot deviate from the statutory requirements, but does note that the additional compensation_a flat 3 hours at
the basic pay rate_is in addition to callback pay. Accordingly, no change to  24.16(f)(2)(v) is made.



24.16(h)_Excluding workers compensation benefits from list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations





Comment:

 The NTEU requests the exclusion of workers compensation benefits and back pay awards and settlements from the listing
of categories not subject to any applicable pay cap calculations.



Customs Response:

 Regarding the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from the list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations,
for the reasons given above at  24.16(e)(2)(ii), no change to  24.16(h) is made. Regarding the exclusion
of back pay awards and settlements, the current regulatory language provides that ``awards made in accordance with
back pay settlements'' shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations. This correctly conveys the fact
that such awards are exempt. Accordingly, no change to  24.16(h) is made concerning this point.



Additional Changes to the Regulations



In addition to the changes discussed above in connection with the analysis of comments, the regulatory texts as set
forth below incorporate certain editorial or other non-substantive changes to the interim regulations to add clarity
and improve the readability of the final regulations. The sections of the interim regulations affected by these changes
are indicated below.



24.16(b)_Definitions



As the definitions of ``commute compensation'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(5)), ``overtime pay'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(13)), and
``premium pay differential'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(15))_now denominated  24.16(b)(14), see next paragraph below
for explanation on redenomination_encompass similar elements pertaining to compensation, the wording of these
three sections is recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive
meanings.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940912-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because of the change to  24.16(d) discussed above under the Discussion of Comments, a definition for ``participating
group'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(14)) is no longer needed. Accordingly, in  24.16(b), paragraphs (15) and (16) are
redenominated paragraphs (14) and (15), respectively. 


24.16(c)_Application and bond 


Although the interim regulations did not make any changes to the provisions of  24.16(c), because this section
references Customs ``employees'' rather than Customs ``Officers'', the term ``employee'' in paragraphs (1) through
(3) is replaced with the term ``Officer'' to reflect the new restricted application of  24.16, as amended by
the COPRA provisions of the 1993 Act. This change is made to make the provisions of paragraph (c) more harmonious with
the rest of the provisions in  24.16. 


24.16(e)_Overtime pay 


In paragraph (2)(i) of  24.16(e), the second sentence regarding the rounding off of overtime work performed
in increments other than a full quarter hour is deleted because it seeks to address a problem that is subject to negotiations
under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. 
In paragraph (2)(ii) of  24.16(e), the last sentence is revised by deleting the words ``for the work assignment''
after ``reports'' and adding the words ``as assigned'' to make it clear that overtime pay is now restricted to hours
assigned and worked. 


24.16(f)_Commute Compensation 


In paragraph (3) of  24.16(f), the last sentence regarding the treatment of certain overtime work to prevent
the inappropriate payment of commute compensation is deleted because it represents a regulatory attempt to correct
a scheduling issue. The district director is responsible for and has discretion in scheduling appropriate overtime
assignments. 
In paragraph (4) of  24.16(f), a stylistic change is made in the first sentence (changing the reference from
``he'' to ``the officer'') and a modification is made in the second sentence (allowing less than all overtime assignments
to be treated as one continuous callback assignment) to give management more flexibility in the assignment of overtime
work. 


24.16(g)_Premium pay differentials 


For the reasons given above concerning recasting three provisions in  24.16(b) because the terms defined encompassed
similar elements pertaining to compensation, the three provisions in  24.16(g) pertaining to premium pay

_paragraphs(g)(1) (Holiday differential), (g)(2) (Sunday differential), and (g)(3) (Night work differential)_are
recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive meanings. 
In paragraph (1)(iv) of  24.16(g), the first sentence is revised and a second sentence is added to make it clear
that where only one assigned shift is worked and any of those hours occur during the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday,
the entire shift will be designated as a holiday and compensated at the holiday rate of pay. Also, a new paragraph (vi)
is added to clarify the compensation computation where only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday
shift is worked. 


134.55_Compensation of Customs Officers and employees 


In paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of  134.55, a grammatical change is made to clarify which regulatory provisions
(COPRA or FEPA) are applicable to provide compensation for which Customs personnel. The change provides that the
COPRA compensation provisions of  24.16 are applicable regarding overtime compensation and premium pay for
Customs Officers, and that the FEPA compensation provisions of  24.17 are applicable regarding overtime compensation
for other Customs employees. 


Conclusion 


In consideration of the comments received, Customs believes that the interim Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional
Services regulations, published as T.D. 94-2 in the 

Federal Register

 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68520), should be adopted as a final rule with certain changes thereto, as discussed above
and set forth below.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act, and 
Executive Order 12866 


Based on the supplementary information set forth above and because the amendments contained in this document reflect
existing statutory requirements or merely implement interpretations and policies that are already in effect under
interim regulations, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

., it is certified that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, the regulations are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O.
12866.

Annuity integrity.

 For Customs Officers within 3 years of their statutory retirement eligibility, the amount of overtime that can be
worked is limited to the average yearly number of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career
with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs
Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this
annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by

returns to the place of work provided that each assignment commences less than 16 hours after the officer's last regularly-scheduled
work assignment. However, in no case shall the compensation be greater than if some or all of the assignments were treated
as one continuous callback assignment.

(g) 

Premium pay differentials.

 * * * The order of precedence for the payment of premium pay differentials is holiday, Sunday, and night
work. 

(1) 

Holiday differential.

 A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled work on a holiday shall receive pay for that work at the officer's
hourly rate of base pay, which includes authorized locality pay, plus premium pay amounting to 100 percent of that
base rate.

Holiday differential premium pay will be paid only for time worked. Intermittent employees are not entitled to holiday
differentials. 



* * * * * 



(iv) If a Customs Officer is assigned to a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tour of duty which contains hours within
and outside the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday_for example, a tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on a Monday holiday following
a scheduled day off on Sunday and ending at 4 a.m. on Tuesday_the Customs Officer shall receive the holiday differential
(up to 8 hours) for work performed during that shift. If the Customs Officer is assigned more than one regularly-scheduled,
non-overtime, tour of duty which contains hours within and outside the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday_for example,
a tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on the Wednesday before a Thursday holiday and ending at 4 a.m. on Thursday with another
regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, tour of duty starting at 8 p.m. on the Thursday holiday and ending at 4 a.m. on
Friday_the management official in charge of assigning work shall designate one of the tours of duty as the officer's
holiday shift and the officer shall receive holiday differential (up to 8 hours) for work performed during the entire
period of the designated holiday shift. 
The Customs Officer shall not receive holiday differential for any of the work performed on the tour of duty which has
not been designated as the holiday shift but will be eligible for Sunday or night differential as appropriate. 



* * * * * 



(vi) A Customs Officer who works only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday shift will be paid
the holiday differential for the actual hours worked and the appropriate differential (Sunday or night) for the remaining
portion of the shift such officer was not required to work. The night differential premium pay shall be calculated
based on the rate applicable to the entire shift. 

(2) 

Sunday differential.

 A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled work on a Sunday that is not a Federal holiday shall receive
pay for that work at the officer's hourly rate of base pay, which includes authorized locality pay, plus premium pay
amounting to 50 percent of that base rate. Sunday differential premium pay will be paid only for time worked and is not
applicable to overtime work performed on a Sunday. A Customs Officer whose regularly-scheduled work occurs in part
on a Sunday, that is not a Federal holiday, and in part on the preceding or following day, will receive the Sunday differential
premium pay for the hours worked between 12:01 a.m. and 12 Midnight on Sunday. Intermittent employees are not entitled
to Sunday differentials.

(3) 

Night work differentials.

 A Customs Officer who performs any regularly-scheduled night work shall receive pay for that work at the officer's
hourly rate of base pay, including locality pay as authorized, plus the applicable premium pay differential, as specified
below, but shall not receive such night differential for work performed during overtime assignments. When all or
the majority of the hours of a Customs Officer's regularly-scheduled work occur between 3 p.m. and 8 a.m., the officer
shall receive a night differential premium for all the hours worked during that assignment. Intermittent employees
are not entitled to night differentials.

Schedules of Controlled Substances; Placement of Alpha-Ethyltryptamine Into Schedule I



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to place alpha-ethyltryptamine
(AET) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This action is based on findings made by the Deputy Administrator
of the DEA, after review and evaluation of the relevant data by both the DEA and the Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services, that AET meets the statutory criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the CSA.
Since this substance has been temporarily placed into Schedule I, the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal
sanctions of Schedule I continue to be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, importation and exportation
of AET.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 12, 1993, the Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 13533) amending  1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place AET into
Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which became
effective on the date of publication, was based on a finding by the Administrator that the temporary scheduling of
AET was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. The CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the
temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective date of the order. However, if
proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated and are pending, the temporary
scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision, the temporary scheduling of AET
which would have expired on March 12, 1994, was extended to September 12, 1994 by the Acting DEA Administrator (59 FR
10720).




On March 7, 1994 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 10718) and after a review of relevant data, the Acting DEA Administrator proposed to place AET into Schedule
I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). Prior to that time the Acting DEA Administrator submitted data which DEA gathered
regarding AET to the Assistant Secretary for Health, delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Acting DEA Administrator also requested a scientific and medical
evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for AET from the Assistant Secretary for Health.

By letter dated August 30, 1994, the Deputy Administrator for the DEA received the scientific and medical evaluation
and scheduling recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Assistant Secretary recommended that
AET be placed into Schedule I of the CSA based on a scientific and medical evaluation of the available data.

The notice of proposed rulemaking for AET provided the opportunity for interested parties to submit comments, objections
or requests for a hearing regarding the scheduling of AET. No comments, objections or requests for hearings were received
regarding the scheduling of AET.

Alpha-ethyltryptamine has been classified as a tryptamine hallucinogen. Chemically it is 

a

-ethyl-1H-indole-3-ethanamine or 3-(2-aminobutyl)indole. It is structurally similar to N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) and N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET) both of which are controlled in Schedule I of the CSA. Available data indicate
that AET produces some pharmacological effects qualitatively similar to those of other Schedule I hallucinogens.
Recent data suggests that AET may produce neurotoxicity similar to the neurotoxic effects produced by MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
and PCA (para-chloroamphetamine).

Alpha-ethyltryptamine acetate was marketed by the Upjohn Company in 1961 as an antidepressant under the trade name
of Monase. After less than one year of marketing, Upjohn withdrew its New Drug Application when it became apparent
that Monase administration was associated with the development of agranulocytosis. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under section 505 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for AET. A search of the scientific and medical literature revealed no indications of current
medical use of AET in the United States.

The DEA first encountered AET in 1986 at a clandestine laboratory in Nevada. Several exhibits of AET have been analyzed
by the DEA and state forensic laboratories since 1989. Individuals in Colorado and Arizona have purchased several
kilograms of this substance as the acetate salt from chemical supply companies and have distributed and sold quantities
to individuals for the purpose of human consumption. Touted as a MDMA-like substance, it has been trafficked as ``TRIP''
or ``ET''. Distribution has been primarily among high school and college-aged individuals. In Arizona, the death
of a nineteen year old female was attributed to acute AET toxicity. Illicit use of AET has been documented in both Germany
and Spain where at least two deaths have resulted from AET overdose.

Based upon the investigation and review conducted by DEA and upon the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation
of the Assistant Secretary for Health received in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator for
the DEA, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b), finds that:

(1) AET has a high potential for abuse;

(2) AET has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and,

(3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of AET under medical supervision.




These findings are consistent with the placement of AET into Schedule I of the CSA.



All regulations applicable to Schedule I substances continue to be in effect as of September 12, 1994 with respect
to AET. This substance has been in Schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h) since
March 12, 1993. The current applicable regulations are as follows:

1. 

Registration. 

Any person who manufactures, distributes, delivers, imports or exports AET or who engages in research or conducts
instructional activities with respect to AET, or who proposes to engage in such activities, must be registered to
conduct such activity in accordance with parts 1301 and 1311 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

2. 

Security. 

Alpha-ethyltryptamine must be manufactured, distributed and stored in accordance with   1301.71-1301.76
of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

3. 

Labeling and Packaging. 

All labels and labeling for commercial containers of AET must comply with   1302.03-1302.05, 1302.07
and 1302.08 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

4. 

Quotas. 

All persons required to obtain quotas for AET shall submit applications pursuant to   1303.12 and 1303.22
of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

5. 

Inventory. 

Every registrant required to keep records and who possesses any quantity of AET shall take an inventory of all stocks
of AET on hand pursuant to   1304.11-1304.19 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

6. 

Records. 

All registrants required to keep records pursuant to   1304.21-1304.27 of Title 21 of the Code of
Federal Regulations shall maintain such records on AET.

7. 

Reports. 

All registrants required to submit reports pursuant to   1304.34-1304.37 of Title 21 of the Code
of Federal Regulations shall do so regarding AET.

8. 

Order Forms. 

All registrants involved in the distribution of AET must comply with   1305.01-1305.16 of Title
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

9. 

Importation and Exportation. 

All importation and exportation of AET shall be in compliance with part 1312 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

10. 

Criminal Liability. 

Any activity with respect to AET not authorized by, or in violation of, the CSA or the Controlled Substances Import
and Export Act shall be unlawful.

The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the placement of AET into Schedule I of the CSA will have no
significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq. 

This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical use in the United States.

In accordance with the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(a), this scheduling action is a formal rulemaking. Such proceedings
are conducted pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and, as such, are exempt from review by the Office of
Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866, 3(d)(1).

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a
Federalism Assessment.

Fair Housing Complaint Processing: Technical Correction



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule: Technical correction.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955), HUD published a final rule that amended its Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations.
The purpose of this document is to correct an error that appeared in  103.400(a)(2)(i) and an error that appeared
in the amendatory instruction for item 4 that directs the changes to be made to  103.405.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Sections 812 (g) and (h) of the Fair Housing Act authorize the Secretary to make determinations of reasonable cause
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred. Section 810(c) authorizes the Secretary to refer
to the Attorney General matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements by respondents for enforcement.
Regulations found at 24 CFR parts 103 and 104 govern the conduct of investigations under the Act by the Assistant Secretary
and the taking of enforcement action in a number of situations.



On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955), HUD published a final rule that amended its Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations,
which are codified in 24 CFR part 103. The purpose of the August 5, 1994 final rule was to advise the public that the Assistant
Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement),
rather than the General Counsel, is authorized (1) to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred and direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations,
and (2) to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
This authority was previously delegated to HUD's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel by the Secretary. Through
the August 5, 1994 final rule, the Secretary transferred the delegation of this authority from the General Counsel
and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement. In transferring this delegation, however, the Secretary intended
for the General Counsel to be consulted and to concur in a determination of reasonable cause before the Assistant Secretary
for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity directs the issuance of such a charge. The language requiring concurrence
of the General Counsel in reasonable cause determinations was inadvertently omitted from the August 5, 1994 final
rule, and therefore does not correctly reflect the Secretary's intended delegation of authority on this matter.
The purpose of this document is to correct this error.

Accordingly, FR Doc. 94-19178, a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955) is corrected to read as follows:
1. In the preamble, on page 39955, in the second column, under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' the second
and third paragraphs under this heading are corrected to read as follows:




This rule amends portions of 24 CFR part 103 to advise that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
(and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement) is authorized, with the concurrence of
the General Counsel, to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred and to direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations. The Assistant Secretary
also is authorized to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
This authority was previously delegated to the General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel of the Department by the
Secretary. Through this final rule, the Secretary has now transferred the delegation of this authority from the General
Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary. However, before determining that reasonable
cause exists to believe that discriminatory housing practice has occurred, and directing the issuance of a charge
based on that determination, the Assistant Secretary must receive the concurrence of the General Counsel.




2. On page 39956, in  103.400, in column one, correct paragraph (a)(2)(i) to read:



 103.400 

Reasonable cause determination.



(a) * * *

(2) * * *
(i) If the Assistant Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary, upon receipt of
concurrence of the General Counsel, will issue such determination and direct the issuance of a charge under  103.405
on behalf of the aggrieved person, and shall notify the complainant and the respondent of this determination by certified
mail or personal service.



* * * * *



3. On page 39956, in the second column, correct the amendatory instruction in item 

#

4, and remove the new sentence at the beginning of paragraph (b) in  103.405 as follows:

4. In  103.405, paragraph (a)(1) is amended by removing the words ``General Counsel'' and inserting in their
place the words ``Assistant Secretary.''

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule sets forth amended regulations pertaining to the Department of the Navy's Freedom of Information Act Program.
The rule reflects changes in the Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.45 from which it is derived, and also incorporates
changes from governing Department of Defense regulations. The sections contained in this rule have been renumbered
to avoid confusion with 32 CFR Part 701 subpart D. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority cited below, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, derived from the
Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.45, which implements within the Department of the Navy the provisions of Department
of Defense Directives 5400.7 and 5400.7-R series, Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program
(32 CFR Part 286), and Department of Defense Directive 5400.9, Publications of Proposed and Adopted Regulations
Affecting the Public (32 CFR Part 336). This rule is being published by the Department of the Navy for guidance and interest
of the public in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1). It has been determined that invitation of public comment on these
changes to the Department of the Navy's implementing instruction prior to adoption would be impracticable and unnecessary,
and it is therefore not required under the public rulemaking provisions of 32 CFR Parts 336 and 701, subpart E. Interested
persons, however, are invited to comment in writing on this amendment. All written comments received will be considered
in making subsequent amendments or revisions to 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, or the instruction upon which it is based.
Changes may be initiated on the basis of comments received. Written comments should be addressed to Lieutenant Sulik,
Office of the Judge Advocate General (Administrative Law Division), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332-2400.
It has been determined that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' within the criteria specified in section 1(b) of
Executive Order 12291 and does not have substantial impact on the public.

 Purpose. 



This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (2) and provisions of Department of Defense Directive 5400.7, May
13, 1988 (32 CFR part 286, 55 FR 53104); Department of Defense Directive 5400.9, December 23, 1974 (32 CFR part 336,
40 FR 4911); and the Regulations of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (1 CFR chaps. I and II) by delineating
responsibilities and prescribing requirements, policies, criteria, and procedures applicable to: 

(a) Publishing the following Department of the Navy documents in the 

Federal Register

: 
 
(1) Certain classes of regulatory, organizational, policy, substantive, and procedural documents required to
be published for the guidance of the public; 
 
(2) Certain classes of proposed regulatory documents required to be published for public comment prior to issuance;
and 
 
(3) Certain public notices required by law or regulation to be published; 

(b) Making available, for public inspection and copying, certain classes of documents having precedential effect
on decisions concerning members of the public;

 for official use within the Department of the Navy. 


 701.62 

Scope and applicability. 


This subpart prescribes actions to be executed by, or at the direction of, Navy Department [as defined in  700.104(c)
of this chapter] components and specified headquarters activities for apprising members of the public of Department
of the Navy regulations, policies, substantive and procedural rules, and decisions which may affect them, and for
enabling members of the public to participate in Department of the Navy rulemaking processes in matters of substantial
and direct concern to the public. This subpart complements subpart A, which implements Navy-wide requirements for
furnishing documents to members of the public upon request. That a document may be published or indexed and made available
for public inspection and copying under this instruction does not affect the possible requirement under subpart
A for producing it for examination, or furnishing a copy, in response to a request made under that subpart. 


 701.63 

Policy. 


In accordance with the spirit and intent of 5 U.S.C. 552, the public has the right to the maximum information concerning
the organization and functions of the Department of the Navy. This includes information on the policies and the substantive
and procedural rules used by the Department of the Navy in its dealings with the public. In accordance with Department
of Defense policy described in 32 CFR part 336, 40 FR 4911, moreover, the public is encouraged to participate in Department
of the Navy rulemaking when the proposed rule would substantially and directly affect the public. 


 701.64 

Publication of adopted regulatory documents for the guidance of the public. 


(a) 

Classes of documents to be published. 

Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) which exempt specified matters from requirements for release to the public
[see subpart B of this part], the classes of Department of the Navy documents required to be published on a current basis
in the 

Federal Register

 are listed below. 
(1) 

Naval organization and points of contact

_descriptions of the central and field organization of the Department of the Navy and the locations at which, the members
or employees from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests,
or obtain decisions; 
(2) 

Methods and procedures for business with the public

_statements of the general course and methods by which Department of the Navy functions affecting members of the public
are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;

(3) 

Procedural rules and forms

_rules of procedure for functions affecting members of the public, descriptions of forms available or the places
at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations
required to be submitted under such rules of procedures; and 
(4) 

Substantive rules and policies

_substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations
of general applicability formulated and adopted by the Department of the Navy. Such rules are commonly contained
in directives, manuals, and memorandums. 
(i) 

``General applicability'' defined. 

The definition prescribed in 1 CFR 1.1 pertains to the classes of documents 
contemplated in  701.64(b)(4). 
(ii) 

Internal personnel rules and internal practices. 

In addition to the other exemptions listed in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and subpart B of this part, particular attention is directed
to the exemption pertaining to internal personnel rules and internal practices. 
(iii) 

Local regulations. 

It is unnecessary to publish in the 

Federal Register

 a regulation which is essentially local in scope or application, such as a directive issued by a base commander in the
implementation of his responsiblity and authority under subpart G of part 700 of this title for guarding the security
of the installation or controlling the access and conduct of visitors or tradesmen. However, such publication may
be authorized under extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Chief of Naval Operations or the Commandant
of the Marine Corps, as appropriate, with the concurrence of the Judge Advocate General.

(iv) 

Incorporation by reference. 

With the approval of the Director of the Federal Register given in the limited instances authorized in 1 CFR Part 51
and 32 CFR 336.5(c), the requirement for publication in the 

Federal Register

 may be satisfied by reference in the 

Federal Register

 to other publications containing the information which must otherwise be published in the 

Federal Register

. In general, matters eligible for incorporation by reference are restricted to materials in the nature of published
data, criteria, standards, specifications, techniques, illustrations, or other published information which
are reasonably available to members of the class affected. 
(b) 

Public inspection. 

When feasible, Department of the Navy and Department of Defense documents published in the 

Federal Register

 should be made available for inspection and copying, along with available indexes of such documents, in the same locations
used for public inspection and copying of the documents contemplated in  701.65. 


 701.65 

Availability, public inspection, and indexing of other documents affecting the public. 


(a) 

Discussion. 

Section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code, requires the Department of the Navy to make available for public inspection
and copying documents which have precedential significance on those Department of the Navy decisions which affect
the public. These documents must be kept readily available for public inspection and copying at designated locations,
unless they are promptly published and copies are offered for sale. Additionally, documents issued after July 4,
1967, are required to be indexed on a current basis. These indexes, or supplements thereto, must be published at least
quarterly in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. In determining whether a particular document is subject
to the requirements of this paragraph, consideration should be given to the statutory purposes and legal effect of
the provisions. 
(1) 

Statutory purposes. 

In general, the purpose of the requirement to provide members of the public with essential information is to enable
them to deal effectively and knowledgeably with Federal agencies; to apprise members of the public of the existence
and contents of documents which have potential legal consequences as precedents in administrative determinations
which may affect them; and to permit public examination of the basis for administrative actions which affect the public.

(2) 

Legal effect. 

If a document is required to be indexed and made available under this paragraph, it may not be used or asserted as a precedent
against a member of the public unless it was so indexed and made available, or unless the person against whom it is asserted
had actual and timely notice of its contents. 
(b) 

Classes of documents affected. 

(1) Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) which exempt specified matters from the requirements of public disclosure,
the following classes of Department of the Navy documents are included in the requirements of this paragraph: 
(i) 

Final adjudicative opinions and orders

_opinions (including concurring and dissenting opinions) and orders which are issued as part of the final disposition
of adjudication proceedings (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) and which may have precedential effect in the disposition
of other cases affecting members of the public; 
(ii) 

Policy statements and interpretations

_statements of policy and interpretations of less than general applicability (i. e., applicable only to specific
cases; organizations, or persons), which are not required to be published in the 

Federal Register

, but which may have precedential effect in the disposition of other cases affecting members of the public; 
(iii) 

Manuals and instructions

_administrative staff manuals, directives, and instructions to staff, or portions thereof, which establish Department
of the Navy policy or interpretations of policy that serve as a basis for determining the rights of members of the public
with regard to Department of the Navy functions. In general, manuals and instructions relating only to internal management
aspects of property or fiscal accounting, personnel administration, and most other ``proprietary'' functions
of the department are not within the scope of this provision. This provision also does not apply to instructions for
employees on methods, techniques, and tactics to be used in performing their duties; for example: 
(A) Instructions or manuals issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes; 
(B) Those which prescribe operational tactics; standards of performance; criteria for defense, prosecution, or
settlement of cases; or negotiating or bargaining techniques, limitations, or positions; and 
(C) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information concerning munitions, equipment, and systems,
and foreign intelligence operations. 
(2) In determining whether a document has precedential effect, the primary test is whether it is intended as guidance
to be followed either in decisions or evaluations by the issuing authority's subordinates, or by the issuing authority
itself in the adjudication or determination of future cases involving similar facts or issues. The kinds of orders
or opinions which clearly would have precedential effect are those that are intended to operate both as final dispositions
of the questions involved in the individual cases presented, and as rules of decision to be followed by the issuing
authority or its subordinates in future cases involving similar questions. By contrast, many adjudicative orders
and opinions issued within the Department of the Navy operate only as case-by-case applications of policies or interpretations
established in provisions of manuals or directives and are not themselves used, cited, or relied on as rules of decision
in future cases. In these instances, the underlying manual or directive provisions obviously would have precedential
effect, but the orders and opinions themselves would not have. A recommendation by an official who is not authorized
to adjudicate, or to issue a binding statement of policy or interpretation in a particular matter would not have precedential
effect, though an order, opinion, statement of policy, or interpretation issued by an authorized official pursuant
to such recommendation might have that effect. 
(c) 

Deletion of identifying details. 

(1) Although the exemptions from public disclosure described in 5 U.S.C. 552 and subpart B of this part are applicable
to documents which are required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under this paragraph,
there is no general requirement that any segregable portions of partially exempt documents be so indexed and made
available for public inspection and copying. As a general rule, a record may therefore be held exempt in its entirety
from the requirements of this paragraph if it is determined that it contains exempt matter and that it is reasonably
foreseeable that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption. An exception to this general
rule does exist with regard to a record which would be exempt only because it contains information which, if disclosed,
would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.

(2) Where necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of a person's privacy, identifying details should
be deleted from a record which is required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under
this paragraph. In every such case, the justification for the deletion must be fully stated in writing in a manner which
avoids creating inferences that could be injurious to the person whose privacy is involved. Usual reasons for deletion
of identifying details include protection of privacy in a person's business affairs, medical matters, or private
family matters; humanitarian considerations; and avoidance of embarrassment to a person. 
(d) 

Publication of indexes_

(1) 

Form of indexes.

 Each index should be arranged topically or by descriptive words, so that members of the public may be able to locate
the pertinent documents by subject, rather than by case name or by a numbering system. 
(2) 

Time of publication.

 Each component having cognizance of records required under this paragraph to be indexed shall compile and maintain
an index of such records on a continually current basis. Each such index was required to initially be published by July
1, 1975. An updated version of each such index, or a current supplement thereto, shall be published by an authorized
method at least annually thereafter. 
(3) 

Methods of publication.

 The methods authorized for publication of the indexes contemplated in this paragraph are: 
(i) Publication in the 

Federal Register

; 
(ii) Commercial publication, provided that such commercial publication is readily available to members of the public,
or will be made available upon request and payment of costs (if this method is utilized, information on the cost of copies
and the address from which they may be obtained shall be published in the 

Federal Register

); or 
(iii) Furnishing internally reproduced copies upon request, at cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication
in accordance with subpart D of this part, provided that it is determined, by an order published in the 

Federal Register

, that the publication of the index by methods  701.65(d)(3) (i) or (ii) would be unnecessary or impracticable.
Such order shall state the cost of copies and the address from which they may be obtained. The Chief of Naval Operations
(N09B30) is authorized to issue such an order in a proper case. 
(4) 

Public inspection of indexes.

 In addition to publication by one of the foregoing methods, each index will be made available for public inspection
and copying in accordance with  701.65(e) at the locations where Department of the Navy records are available
for public inspection. 
e. 

Where records may be inspected.

 Locations and times at which Department of the Navy records, and indexes thereof, are available for public inspection
and copying are shown in  701.32.

(f) 

Cost.

 Fees for copying services, if any, furnished at locations shown in  701.32 shall be determined in accordance
with subpart D of this part. 
(g) 

Records of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review.

 The United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review is deemed to be a ``court of the United States'' within
the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 551 and is therefore excluded from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552. Nevertheless, unpublished
decisions of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review, although not indexed, are available for
public inspection at the location shown in  701.32(c). 


 701.66 Publication of proposed regulations for public comment



(a) 

Discussion.

 The requirements of this section are not imposed by statute, but are the implementation of policies and procedures
created administratively in 32 CFR part 336. In effect, the pertinent provisions of 32 CFR part 336 establish, within
the Department of Defense and its components, procedures that are analogous to the public rulemaking procedures
applicable to some functions of other Federal agencies under 5 U.S.C. 553. While the administrative policy of encouraging
the maximum practicable public participation in the Department of the Navy rulemaking shall be diligently followed,
determinations by the Department of the Navy as to whether a proposed regulatory requirement originated by it comes
within the purview of this paragraph and the corresponding provisions of 32 CFR part 336, and as to whether inviting
public comment is warranted, shall be conclusive and final. 
(b) 

Classes of documents affected.

 Each proposed regulation or other document of a class described in  701.64(a) (or a proposed revision of an adopted
document of any of those classes) which would ``originate'' within the Department of the Navy a requirement of general
applicability and future effect for implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law or policy, or practice and procedure
requirements constituting authority for prospective actions having substantial and direct impact on the public,
or a significant portion of the public, must be evaluated to determine whether inviting public comment prior to issuance
is warranted. Documents that merely implement regulations previously issued by higher naval authorities or by the
Department of Defense will not be deemed to ``originate'' requirements within the purview of this section. If a proposed
document is within the purview of this section, publication to invite public comment will be warranted unless, upon
evaluation, it is affirmatively determined both that a significant and legitimate interest of the Department of
the Navy or the public will be served by omitting such publication for public comment, and that the document is subject
to one or more of the following exceptions: 
(1) It pertains to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States which has been determined under the criteria
of an Executive Order or statute to require a security classification in the interests of national defense or foreign
policy; 
(2) It relates to naval management, naval military or civilian personnel, or public contracts (e.g., Navy Procurement
Directives), including nonappropriated fund contracts; 
(3) It involves interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure,
or practice; or 
(4) It is determined with regard to the document, for good cause, that inviting public comment is impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest. 
(c) 

Procedures_

(1) 

Normal case.

 Unless the official having cognizance of a proposed regulatory document determines under the criteria of  701.66(b)
that inviting public comment is not warranted, he or she shall cause it to be published in the 

Federal Register

 with an invitation for the public to submit comments in the form of written data, views, or arguments during a specified
period of not less than 30 days following the date of publication. An opportunity for oral presentation normally will
not be provided, but may be provided at the sole discretion of the official having cognizance of the proposed directive
if he or she deems it to be in the best interest of the Department of the Navy or the public to do so. After careful consideration
of all relevant matters presented within the period specified for public comment, the proposed document may be issued
in final form. After issuance, the adopted document, and a preamble explaining the relationship of the adopted document
to the proposed document and the nature and effect of public comments, shall be published in the 

Federal Register

 for the guidance of the public. 
(2) 

Where public comment is not warranted.

 The official having cognizance of a proposed document within the purview of this paragraph shall, if he or she determines
that inviting public comment concerning the document is not warranted under the criteria of  701.66(b), incorporate
that determination, and the basis therefor, in the document when it is issued or submitted to a higher authority for
issuance. After issuance, such document shall be published in the 

Federal Register

 for the guidance of the public, if required under  701.64(b). 


 701.67 Petitions for issuance, revision, or cancellation of regulations affecting the public 


In accordance with the provisions of 32 CFR part 336, the Department of the Navy shall accord any interested person
the right to petition, in writing, for the issuance, revision, or cancellation of regulatory document that originates,
or would originate, for the Department of the Navy, a policy, requirement, or procedure which is, or would be, within
the purview of  701.66. The official having cognizance of the particular regulatory document involved, or
having cognizance of the subject matter of a proposed document, shall give full and prompt consideration to any such
petition. Such official may, at his or her absolute discretion, grant the petitioner an opportunity to appear, at
his or her own expense, for the purpose of supporting the petition, if this is deemed to be compatible with orderly conduct
of public business. The petitioner shall be advised in writing of the disposition, and the reasons for the disposition,
of any petition within the purview of this section.

Approval and Promulgation of Emission Statement Implementation Plan; Washington State


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State
of Washington for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Vancouver
Air Quality Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound Ozone Nonattainment Area. The implementation plan was submitted
by the State to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Washington
State.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act'').
EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within
the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620
(November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO

x

 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992 establishing
this emission statement program.
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data
accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and
typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements
data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that
have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual
and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule-effectiveness
(RE). States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission
statement and that emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC or 2500 tpy or more of NO

x

. This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year.
Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. 



II. Analysis of State Submission


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.


A. Procedural Background


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Sections 110(a)(l) and 110(a)(2) of the Act provide that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 
The State of Washington held a public hearing on January 5, 1993 in Vancouver, and January 6, 1993 in SeaTac to solicit
public comment on the implementation plan for the Vancouver Air Quality Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound
Ozone Nonattainment Areas, respectively. Following the public hearing, the plan was signed by the Director of the
Washington State Department of Ecology (the Governor's designee) on January 22, 1993. EPA received an official revision
to the SIP on January 28, 1993 which supersedes the SIP submittal of November 16, 1992. Additionally, replacement
pages were submitted July 5, 1994 to clarify which sources are subject to the emission statement program.
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness the criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). A
letter dated April 8, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next
steps to be taken in the review process. In today's action, EPA approves Washington's emission statement program
SIP submittal and invites public comment on the action.


B. Components of Emission Statement Program


1. Program Elements 


Washington's emission statement program includes provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions
for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific
reporting requirements for sources. Under Washington State law, the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) sections 70.94.141
and 70.94.331 authorize Ecology and local authorities to ``require access to records, books, files, and other information
specific to the control, recovery, or release of air contaminants into the atmosphere.'' The Washington Administrative
Code (WAC) 173-400-105 states that ``the owner or operator of a source shall upon notification by the director
of Ecology, maintain records ... deemed necessary to determine whether the source is in compliance with applicable
emission limitations and control measures.''


2. Reporting Requirements for Sources 


In accordance with the Act, Washington's emission statement program requires sources to submit certification that
the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification
information, operating information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information.



3. Reporting Requirements for State 


Washington's emission statement program includes a provision for the State to provide the identifying information
for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness utilized by the State
in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission statement status reports.
The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission statements program
requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Washington has submitted quarterly
emissions statement status reports since July 1, 1993. The emissions statement status reports contain all required
data elements. Ecology and the local air pollution control authorities require emission statement data for the annual
emission inventory update. 


4. Sources Covered


Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone (O

3

) require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NOx



) in the nonattainment areas. Washington's Emission Statement Program applies the source reporting requirements
as outlined in EPA's ``Draft Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program.'' Sources subject
to this requirement are: (1) Sources in O3 nonattainment areas that emit 25 (tpy) or more of NOx; and (2) sources in O3
nonattainment areas that emit 25 tpy or more of VOC. Additionally, if a source emits at least the minimum established
reporting level of VOC or NOx (for example, 25 tpy or more in an O3 nonattainment area), and the other pollutant is emitted
at less than 25 tpy, then the other pollutant should also be included in the emission statement. 


5. Enforceability Issues


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J.
Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also contain
a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)
of the Act). 
The State of Washington has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of sections 182(a)(3)(B), 182(f),
and 184(b)(2) of the Act for emission statement measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. Submission
of emission statement data is enforced through the Southwest Air Pollution Control Authority (SWAPCA) and the Puget
Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA). PSAPCA requires submission by April 15 of each year, and SWAPCA requires
submission by March 15 of each year. EPA expects that the state's existing air enforcement program will be adequate.



III. Final Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
In this action, EPA is granting approval of the emission statement plan revision submitted to EPA on January 28, 1993
because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA. 



IV. Administrative Review


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

 , 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will become effective on November 14, 1994 unless, by October 12, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be
challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action approves a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete 
El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the
purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. This Federal Register
(FR) action approves some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, including the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory
and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP have been or will be acted upon
in separate FR actions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below

12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under 
sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991), 57 FR 13498, and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and
three of part D, title I of the CAA. 




The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment
area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). 
Moderate CO nonattainment areas less than 12.7 ppm., 
such as El Paso, were required to submit SIPs to the EPA by 
November 15, 1992, containing specifically: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions
from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the CAA); (2) no later than September
30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until the area is redesignated to attainment,
a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA; (3) a permit program
to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for the construction and operation
of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency measures due November 15,
1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the primary standards by the
applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program and submit a SIP revision
for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels program 
(section 211(m)).

Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (58 FR 15683-15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In this FR action,
the EPA is approving two of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP will be acted upon
in separate FR actions. 


Response to Comments 


As stated previously, the EPA proposed approval of the 
El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels 
regulations on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683-15686), and no comments were received regarding the proposed approval.



Final Action 


Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The EPA in this action is approving the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. These two elements meet all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.
The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP that were submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1992, or by November
15, 1993, will be or have been acted upon in separate FR actions. 
On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP narrative revision for CO concerning El Paso, which
included the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed
emissions inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing 


I/M program on November 15, 1992. 


The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683-15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In that rulemaking
action, the EPA described in detail its interpretation of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve these
elements of the El Paso CO SIP after taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. It is important
to note that the El Paso CO 1990 base year inventory consists of the following list of the CO peak season daily emissions
estimates in tons per day (t/d): Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources, 291 t/d;
Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d. 
This final action on the El Paso CO SIP is unchanged from the April 4, 1994, proposed approval action. The EPA prepared
a detailed analysis in its Technical Support Document as a part of its proposed approval and which is available for
review along with the current FR document at the locations referenced in the beginning of this FR document. The discussion
herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the April 4, 1994, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the EPA is now finalizing.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15683 (April 4, 1994). As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA
received no public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from table two to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989,
and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional Administrators
dated October 4, 1993. 
The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is approving the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated
fuels regulations in this action. Other elements described above will be or have been addressed in separate FR documents.

(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 
427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S. Ct. 1976)); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Benomyl and Trifluralin; Reinstatement of Food Additive Regulations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; Reinstatement of Food Additive Regulations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1994, EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food additive regulations for benomyl
(processed tomato products and raisins) and trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint oil). The Circuit Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit ordered EPA on August 24, 1994, to stay the effectiveness of those revocations. By this document,
EPA is implementing the Court's order by reinstating the food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin pending
judicial review of EPA's June 1994 Order by that Court.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33684) (``June 1994 Order''), EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food
additive regulations for benomyl (processed tomato products and raisins), trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint
oil), mancozeb (bran of wheat), and phosmet (cottonseed oil). On July 14, 1994, the registrants for benomyl and trifluralin
filed a petition for review of EPA's June 1994 Order with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition,
DuPont and DowElanco filed with the Court a ``Motion for Summary Reversal, or in the Alternative, Stay Pending Review.''
On August 24, 1994, the Court denied Petitioners' Motion for a Summary Reversal, but granted the Motion for a Stay Pending
Judicial Review. 


By this document, EPA is implementing the Court's Order granting a stay by reinstating the benomyl (processed tomato
products and raisins) and trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint oil) food additive regulations pending judicial
review of EPA's decision. These regulations, therefore, will remain in place until the stay is terminated, EPA is
otherwise ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or another court, or EPA takes further administrative action.
EPA is not reinstating the food additive regulations for mancozeb (bran of wheat) and phosmet (cottonseed oil) because
they were not the subject of the Court's August 24, 1994 decision. Therefore, those regulations continue to be revoked.
Until otherwise acted upon by EPA, the Code of Federal Regulations text will continue to include the full text of the
food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin (40 CFR 185.350 and 185.5900).

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission adopted this Order on Reconsideration to rule on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order

Act (TDDRA). The Commission affirmed these rules with minor modifications, consistent with the TDDRA. The rules
are intended to maximize telephone subscribers' protection against fraudulent and abusive practices without unduly
burdening common carriers and providers of legitimate pay-per-call services.

Summary of Order on Reconsideration




1. On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket No 93-22 (released August
31, 1994; FCC 94-200) (Order) ruling on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order, 58 FR 44769 (Aug.
25, 1993), which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute
Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). As explained below, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications,
regulations governing interstate pay-per-call and similar information services.

2. The Commission modified  64.1506 to clarify that services specifically exempted from the TDDRA's definition
of ``pay-per-call'' need not be offered exclusively through 900 numbers. The Commission stated that it had not intended
to negate the express exclusions from pay-per-call status enacted by Congress in the TDDRA, and, accordingly, amended
 64.1506 to require that any interstate services possessing the basic pay-per-call attributes set forth in
the statute and  64.1501(a)(1)-(2), and not subject to the exclusions stated in that section, must be
offered only through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code.

3. The Commission affirmed  64.1508(c) which requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to file federal tariffs
for services that offer subscribers the option of blocking access to 900 numbers and al
