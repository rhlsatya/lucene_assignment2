Extend Coverage To Include Fresh and Frozen Fruits and Vegetables That Are Oil-Blanched, Including Frozen French
Fried Potato Products; Reopening of Comment Period on Proposed Rule Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA)




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Reopening of Comment Period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document reopens the period for filing written comments on a proposed rule published on July 12, 1994, that would
extend PACA coverage to include fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, including frozen french
fried potato products. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rule was published in the July 12, 1994 issue of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 35487). The proposed rule would amend the definition of fresh fruit and vegetables set forth in 7 CFR 46.2(u)
of the Regulations issued pursuant to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499o). This document
extends PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially frozen french fried
potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable financial
losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. Reopening the comment period grants dealers in
frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched. 



On August 10, 1994, the Agency received a request from the Food Marketing Institute, International Foodservice Distributors
Association, National-American Wholesale Grocers Association, National Council of Chain Restaurants, National
Grocers Association, and the National Restaurant Association requesting a 90-day extension of the comment period.
The request stated they needed additional time to develop their comments. 

The Department has determined that a 30-day extension of the comment period will provide adequate time for interested
persons to respond to this proposed rule. Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to October 12, 1994.

Special Conditions: Learjet Inc., Model 45 Airplane, Lightning and High-Intensity Radiated Fields


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final special conditions.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued for the Learjet Inc. (Lear) Model 45 airplane. This new airplane utilizes new
avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The applicable regulations do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of lightning and high-intensity
radiated fields. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers
necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background


On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc. (Lear), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209-2942, P.O. Box 7707, Wichita,
KS 67277-7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane.
The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731-20 turbofan
engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine is capable of delivering 3,500 lbs. thrust
(3,650 lbs. thrust with auto performance reserve). The airplane is capable of operating with two flight crewmembers
and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers).


Type Certification Basis


Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in  25.2, that the Model
45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through
25-75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September
10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended
by Amendments 36-1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions form
an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special
conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions.
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).


Novel or Unusual Design Features


The Model 45 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays, an electronically
controlled braking system, digital electronic engine controls, an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS),
multifunction display, and a digital autopilot/flight director system. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane.


Discussion


The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general ( 25.581), and the other for fuel system protection
( 25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protecton of electrical and electronic
systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe
flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane.
There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems
from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the Lear Model 45, which require that new technology electrical and electronic
systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct
and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.


Lightning


To provide a means of compliance with these special conditions, clarification of the threat definition of lightning
is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20-136, Protection of Aircraft
Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed as a basis
to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception of the multiple
burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.
The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20-53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the
airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding,
airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, tests (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation)
and/or verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems.
The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility
to upset and/or malfunction.
To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required:
1. 

First Return Stroke:

 (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant
internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment
``hardness'' level.

2. 

Multiple Stroke Flash: 

(1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple
strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary
factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of
time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets
over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing
and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system
response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described
as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of
50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints:
(1) the minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms.
An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system
under evaluation.
3. 

Multiple Burst: 

(Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise,
short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in
these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset
to some digital processing systems.
The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak
rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight
data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of
the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order
to be used. This ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component
H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds,
the maximum is 1,000 microseconds. The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum
period between bursts in 30ms, and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst''
Component H waveform is defined below.
The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple
Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H).
These components are defined by the following double exponential equation:




i(t)=I

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) 



With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established. 

It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special
condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 

1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. 

a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding. 

b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 

2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. 



 


The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions
in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised
envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S. 

As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to the Learjet Model 45. Should Learjet apply at a later
date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature,
these special conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1). 



Discussion of Comments 



Notice of proposed special conditions No. SC-94-2-NM for the Learjet Model 45 airplane was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22766). No comments were received, and the special conditions are adopted as proposed. 



Conclusion 



This action affects only certain design features on the Learjet Model 45 airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability
and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

Background



On March 29, 1994, the FAA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14571) proposed special conditions for the Cessna Model 750 (Citation X). These special conditions are proposed
requirements to protect the airplane systems from the effects of lightning and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF).
Cessna, commenting to the docket by letter, noted that there were differences in the preamble language from the language
used in issue papers that discussed the proposed method of compliance with these special conditions. The FAA agrees.
Although the special conditions proposed herein have not changed from the original notice, the methods of compliance
discussed in the issue papers that preceded the original notice were in fact different in certain respects than the
methods of compliance discussed in the original notice. The FAA inadvertently left out Cessna's proposed alternate
methods of complying with the proposed special conditions. As the methods of compliance proposed by Cessna deviate
in certain respects from previous methods of compliance with the proposed special conditions, the FAA agrees these
methods should also be made available for the public record and comment as well.
On October 15, 1991, Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna), 6030 Cessna Blvd., P.O. Box 7704, Wichita, KS 67277-7704,
applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 750 (Citation X) airplane. The
Cessna Model 750 is a T-tail, low swept wing, medium-sized business jet powered by two GMA-3007C turbofan engines
mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 6,000 pounds thrust.
The flight controls will be powered and capable of manual reversion. The airplane has a seating capacity of up to twelve
passengers, and a maximum takeoff weight of 31,000 pounds.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Cessna must show, except as provided in  25.2, that the Model
750 (Citation X) meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1
through 25-74. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 750 includes part 34, effective
September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1,
1969, as amended by Amendment 36-1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. No exemptions
are anticipated. The special conditions that may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part
of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that
are not relevant to these proposed special conditions.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Cessna Model 750 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).



Novel or Unusual Design Features



The Model 750 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including a digital Electronic Flight Instrument
System (EFIS), Air Data System, Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), Navigation and Communication System,
Autopilot System, and a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system that controls critical engine parameters.
These systems may be vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane.



Discussion



The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general ( 25.581), and the other for fuel system protection

To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are proposed for the Cessna Model 750, which would require that new technology electrical and
electronic systems, such as the EFIS, FADEC, AHRS, etc., be designed and installed to preclude component damage and
interruption of function due to both the direct and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.

To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition
of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20-136, Protection

as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception
of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.

The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20-53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the

It is Cessna's position that only damage tolerance testing of equipment that performs essential functions should
be required using the procedures and conditions specified in DO-160C, Section 22 (change 2). Pin injection
or cable bundle testing would be required, but there should be no multi-strike or multi-burst requirement. Cessna
proposes that to evaluate the induced effects of lightning to the systems under consideration, the following must
be considered:



Essential Functions: First Return Stroke
Critical Functions: First Return Stroke; Multi-Stroke; Multi-Burst


High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)


With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established.
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, the FAA has used criteria for compliance with the HIRF protection special condition shown
in paragraphs 1 or 2 below:
1. A mininum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

Cessna's market for the Model 750 Citation X includes, at the present time, two European JAA member countries. Consequently,
Cessna intends to pursue certification to meet the European JAA requirements as well as the FAA requirements. To reduce
the testing required, Cessna proposes to test to an environment that combines a proposed FAA certification environment
(from the SAE AE4R Subcommittee) and a proposed JAA certification environment (from EUROCAE WG-33) to form
a ``worst case'' certification environment. This environment will consist of the following:
Where the combined proposed certification environment is less than 100 volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed
certification environment (JAA or FAA, whichever is higher). Where the combined environment is greater than 100
volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed JAA environment (less aircraft attenuation above 200 MHz). The aircraft
attenuation will be established by the results of full vehicle tests conducted by Cessna on Model 650, Citation III,
and Citation VII aircraft. Cessna's proposed Model 750 HIRF certification environment is as follows:






Conclusion



This action affects only certain design features on the Cessna Model 750 (Citation X) airplane. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Washington



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for
the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Vancouver Air Quality
Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound Ozone Nonattainment Area. The SIP revision was submitted by the State
to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Washington
State. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emissions From the Synthetic
Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Wastewater 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes standards of performance for wastewater sources in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing
Industry (SOCMI). These standards implement section 111 of the Clean Air Act (the ACT) and are based on the Administrator's
determination that VOC emissions from SOCMI cause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution that may reasonably
be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The intended effect of these standards is to require all new,
modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units to control wastewater emissions to the level achievable by the best
demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction, considering costs, nonair quality health, environmental,
and energy impacts, not just with end-of-pipe and add-on controls, but also by eliminating or reducing the formation
of these pollutants. The proposed regulation would achieve an estimated reduction of 16,200 megagrams (Mg) of VOC
in the fifth year following promulgation.

I. Introduction 


A. New Source Performance Standards_General 


New source performance standards (NSPS) implement 
section 111 of the Act. The NSPS are issued for categories 
of sources that cause, or contribute significantly to, air 
pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
public health or welfare. They apply to new stationary 
sources of emissions, i.e., sources whose construction, 
reconstruction, or modification begins after a standard for 
them is proposed. 
An NSPS requires these sources to control emissions to 
the level achievable by ``best demonstrated technology,'' or 
``BDT.'' 


B. NSPS Decision Scheme 


An NSPS is the product of a series of decisions made 
during development of the regulation. Elements in this 
``decision scheme'' include the following: 
1. Source category to be regulated: usually an entire 
industry, but can be a process or group of processes within 
an industry. 
2. Pollutant(s) to be regulated: the particular 
substance(s) emitted by the source that the standard will 
control. 
3. Best demonstrated technology: the technology on 
which the Agency will base the standards, as defined in 
section 111(a)(1) of the Act. 
4. Affected facility: the pieces or groups of 
equipment that comprise the sources to which the standards 
will apply. 
5. Emission points to be regulated: within the 
affected facility, the specific physical location emitting 
pollutants (e.g., vents, equipment leaks, and wastewater 
streams). 
6. Format for the standards: the form in which the 
standards are expressed, i.e., as a percent reduction in 
emissions, as pollutant concentration, or as equipment 
standards. 
7. Standards: based on what BDT can achieve, the 
maximum permissible emissions, or design, equipment, work 
practice, or operational requirements if emission limits are 
infeasible. 
8. Other considerations: in addition, NSPS usually 
include modification/reconstruction considerations, 
monitoring requirements, performance test methods, and 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 


II. Summary of the Proposed NSPS 


A. Source Category To Be Regulated 


Volatile organic compound emissions from SOCMI 
wastewater (also referred to as ``secondary sources'') are 
being regulated under section 111 of the Act. The proposed 
standards would regulate VOC emissions from wastewater 
generated by SOCMI process units and are limited to emission 
points in the associated process unit's wastewater 
collection and treatment systems. Specific emission points 
are discussed in section II.E. 
Wastewater is water that comes in contact with process 
fluids during manufacturing, processing, or maintenance 
operations within a process unit at a SOCMI facility. Most 
wastewaters contain relatively low concentrations of 
contaminants (e.g., less than 2 percent or 20,000 parts per 
million (ppm)) and are managed in wastewater collection and 
treatment systems. Wastewater collection and treatment 
systems typically include individual drain systems, oil- 
water separators, air flotation units, equalization tanks, 
and biological treatments units. Volatile organic compounds 
are emitted from the wastewater during collection and 
treatment. 
Regulations targeting emissions from SOCMI wastewater 
have been developed previously. National emission standards 
for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for benzene waste 
operations (40 CFR part 61, subpart FF) regulate benzene 
emissions from SOCMI waste streams that contain benzene at 
concentrations of 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw) or 
more at facilities that handle at least 10 Mg/yr of benzene 
in certain wastes. A second regulation, the hazardous 
organic NESHAP (``the HON'') in subpart G of 40 CFR part 63, 
is broader in scope, regulating emissions of many organic 
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from SOCMI wastewater. The 
HON imposes standards on SOCMI process wastewater streams 
from process units that produce any of a selected group of 
products at facilities that are major sources under the Act. 
The rule covers individual waste streams that contain one or 
more of the HAP identified in section 112(b) of the Act at 
concentrations above specified levels. Generally, a SOCMI 
source subject to the benzene waste NESHAP would also be 
subject to the HON.

A third regulation that may affect the chemical 
industry is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA) air emission standards for hazardous waste treatment, 
storage, and disposal facilities. That rule will establish 
standards for controlling emissions from wastes that are 
identified as hazardous under RCRA at facilities subject to 
subtitle C permitting requirements. Under that rule, 
hazardous wastes would have to be managed in controlled 
units until the waste is treated to remove or destroy 
certain hazardous components. The rule only applies to 
units and facilities that are permitted under RCRA 
subtitle C. However, under RCRA, wastewater treatment units 
are not subject to subtitle C hazardous waste management 
standards provided the unit is part of a wastewater 
treatment facility that is subject to regulation under 
either section 402 or 307(b) of the Clean Water Act. Thus, 
hazardous waste tank systems that are used to store or treat 
wastewater that is managed at an on-site wastewater 
treatment facility with a National Pollution Discharge 
Elimination System permit or that discharges to a publicly- 
owned treatment works would generally be exempt from the 
RCRA regulations. 
In addition to the HON, the benzene waste NESHAP, and 
the RCRA air standards, section 182(b)(2) of the Act 
requires that State implementation plans (SIP's) for certain 
ozone nonattainment areas be revised to require the 
implementation of reasonably available control technology 
(RACT) for control of VOC emissions. The EPA has defined 
RACT generally as the lowest emission limitation that a 
particular source is capable of meeting by the application 
of control technology that is reasonably available, 
considering technological and economic feasibility. In some 
cases, the EPA has, or will, issue guidance relative to RACT 
in the form of a control techniques guidelines (CTG) 
document. A draft of the Industrial Wastewater (IWW) CTG 
was released for public comment on December 29, 1993. The 
SOCMI is a subset of the industry group which is covered by 
the IWW CTG. The CTG is intended to provide State and local 
air pollution authorities with an information base for 
proceeding with their own analysis of RACT to meet statutory 
requirements. Due to time and budget constraints, the IWW 
CTG has not been finalized. An alternative control 
technology (ACT) document has been prepared and provided to 
the States as interim guidance to aid in development of 
rules in the absence of the final IWW CTG. 
In spite of the guidance and the three separate rules 
to regulate emissions from wastewater streams at SOCMI 
facilities, there are substantial gaps in the extent to 
which these rules control emissions from SOCMI wastewater 
streams with the potential to emit VOC. The HON applies to 
only a segment of the industry that produces a specified set 
of products, which does not include all SOCMI installations. 
In addition, the HON only regulates streams that contain HAP 
at concentrations above a trigger level. Consequently, the 
HON does not regulate wastewater streams that emit VOC that 
are not HAP. The benzene waste NESHAP applies to all SOCMI 
installations but is very limited in scope regarding the 
waste streams regulated, i.e., only those streams that 
contain benzene are subject to the rule. Many of the 
wastewater streams at SOCMI plants do not contain benzene 
but do contain other VOC that are emitted to the atmosphere 
if left uncontrolled. The RCRA air standards for hazardous 
waste toxic storage and disposal facilities are not expected 
to impact a significant number of wastewater streams at 
SOCMI plants because of the wastewater exemption under RCRA 
that was discussed above. 
The EPA analysis of SOCMI wastewater data submitted by 
industry shows a significant number of wastewater streams 
generated by SOCMI process units will not be regulated by 
the HON or other wastewater related rules. This is in large 
part a result of the fact that the source category coverage 
for the SOCMI Wastewater NSPS is considerably broader than 
that of the HON. For example, the chemical list defining 
the affected SOCMI process units is nearly twice as large 
for the NSPS as for the HON. For many of the SOCMI 
industries, VOC-containing wastewater streams do not contain 
HAP and therefore controlling only HAP-containing streams, 
as is required under the HON, would not substantially reduce 
VOC emissions. It is estimated that 68 percent of all new 
SOCMI chemical production process units will have wastewater 
streams that would require control under the proposed NSPS 
but will not require control under the HON. 
This NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources is needed to 
fill the gaps in the coverage of VOC emissions from 
wastewater streams left uncovered by other regulations. In 
addition, the benzene waste NESHAP and the RCRA air 
standards are risk-based standards. Risk-based standards 
are designed to reduce emissions to a level that will 
protect human health and the environment with an ample 
margin of safety. The goal of an NSPS, on the other hand, 
is to improve ambient air quality over time by application 
of best demonstrated technology (BDT) on all new, modified, 
or reconstructed sources. The goal of the CTG is to provide 
guidance to States in revising their SIP's and to help bring 
their nonattainment areas into compliance with the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards. The SIP rules do not apply 
at facilities that are in ozone attainment areas. 
Furthermore, NSPS require installation of BDT rather than 
RACT, which in some cases may achieve a higher level of 
emission reduction. The NSPS would impose consistent, 
nationwide regulatory requirements, which would ensure that 
waste streams and wastewater streams at all new, modified, 
and reconstructed SOCMI process units are controlled in a 
consistent manner using the best emission controls. 
In summary, although a portion of waste streams and 
wastewater streams at SOCMI sites are already controlled as 
a result of existing and planned regulations, none of these 
regulations cover all SOCMI waste streams with the potential 
to emit VOC. These other regulations are limited in scope 
and leave some wastewater streams uncontrolled for air 
emissions. These uncontrolled wastewater streams are the 
subject of the NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources. 
It is possible that there may be some overlap among 
those regulations affecting wastes and wastewater at SOCMI 
facilities, leading to possibly duplicative requirements. 
In order to avoid the burden of such duplication, the EPA is 
proposing in the SOCMI NSPS that the owner or operator of 
waste management units, treatment processes, or control 
devices affected by the proposed rule may comply with the 
control requirements of the proposed rule by demonstrating 
compliance with the benzene waste operations NESHAP, the 
HON, or the RCRA air emission standards for hazardous waste 
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. The owner or 
operator would also be required to maintain records 
documenting which regulation is being used to demonstrate 
compliance with the proposed NSPS. An owner or operator who 
chooses to demonstrate compliance in this manner would be 
exempted from the inspection, monitoring, reporting, and 
recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule that relate 
to the affected waste management unit, treatment process, or 
control device. The Agency is soliciting comments on the 
proposed approach to reducing the regulatory burden for 
these sources. In addition, the Agency is interested in 
receiving information on the level of burden that would be 
imposed by the possible duplication of requirements.

B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 


The air pollutant to be regulated by these standards is 
VOC. The primary air pollutant from SOCMI wastewater 
facilities is VOC, which is a precursor to the formation of 
ozone and oxygenated organic aerosols. 


C. Best Demonstrated Technology 


Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect 
the degree of emission limitation and the percentage 
reduction achievable through application of the best 
technological system of continuous emission reduction which 
(taking into consideration the cost of achieving such 
emission reduction, any nonair quality health and 
environmental impact and energy requirements) the 
Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.'' 
The technology basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is 
referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the 
standards development process for NSPS, BDT should be 
identified, the performance of BDT established, and a 
regulatory alternative selected that will require the use of 
BDT or an equivalent technology. 
Volatile organic compound emissions from wastewater can 
be effectively reduced with the following control approach: 
(1) Identify wastewater streams with significant VOC 
emission potential; (2) recycle or treat those wastewater 
streams to remove their potential for emissions; (3) prior 
to treatment or recycling, manage those waste streams in 
units equipped with air emission controls; (4) recycle any 
treatment residuals or treat any residuals to destroy the 
VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by treatment 
processes. 
The treatment technology that is the basis for the 
proposed standards for wastewater is steam stripping, a 
proven treatment technology for wastewaters generated within 
the targeted industry. It is generally applicable to 
wastewater streams with the potential to emit VOC and, in 
general, achieves the highest VOC emission reduction among 
demonstrated VOC control technologies. Facilities can 
comply by installing the design steam stripper or by installing a stripper or other treatment device that 
achieves an equivalent VOC emission reduction. Control of 
air emissions from the stripper and from treatment residuals 
is also required. Although standards for wastewater are 
based on the performance of steam stripping, other treatment 
technologies such as biodegradation have also been 
demonstrated to be effective. To be considered equivalent 
to steam stripping, a properly operated biological treatment 
unit must achieve a 95-percent VOC reduction or meet the 
required mass removal while controlling air emissions. 
Biodegradation may also be used as one of a series of 
treatment processes (e.g., a steam stripper followed by a 
biological treatment unit) where the combination achieves a 
reduction of 99 percent or more in volatile organic 
concentration. Alternative treatment technologies other 
than biodegradation are permitted if their performance 
equals or exceeds that of steam stripping, i.e., a 
99-percent VOC reduction. 


D. Affected Facility 


For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the affected facility 
will be each new process unit (and the wastewater streams it 
generates) at a SOCMI plant. A SOCMI process unit will be 
defined as one producing one or more of the chemicals listed 
in the regulation. A process unit at a SOCMI plant will be 
considered to be new if construction, modification, or 
reconstruction of the unit commences after the date the NSPS 
is proposed in the 

Federal Register

. 


E. Emission Points to be Regulated 


The air emission points selected for the proposed 
regulations include all significant points in SOCMI process 
unit wastewater collection and treatment systems that manage 
process or maintenance wastewater streams or residuals 
generated from SOCMI process units that produce any of the 
listed chemicals. The air emission release points in the 
process unit wastewater collection and treatment system 
include individual drain systems, which are comprised of 
equipment such as open trenches, drains, manholes, junction 
boxes, lift stations, and weirs; surface impoundments; 
wastewater storage and treatment tanks; oil-water 
separators; containers; clarifiers; and biological treatment 
units. At these release points, VOC can be transferred from 
the process unit wastewater stream to the air.

F. Format for the Standards 


As authorized under section 111 of the Act, the 
proposed standards consist of a combination of emission 
standards and equipment, design, and work practice 
standards. Emission standards are used whenever feasible; 
however, such standards are not feasible in all 
circumstances. In some cases, alternative emission 
standards are also proposed. Separate standards for tanks, 
surface impoundments, containers, individual drain systems, 
oil-water separators, treatment processes, and control 
devices are proposed. 


G. Proposed Standards 


Under the proposed standards, SOCMI process unit 
wastewater streams with a volatile organic concentration 
(measured using Reference Method 25D, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A) greater than or equal to 500 ppmw and flow rates 
greater than or equal to 1.0 liter per minute (Lpm) are 
required to be controlled. In addition, any wastewater 
stream with a volatile organic concentration greater than 
10,000 ppmw would be controlled under the regulation, 
regardless of flow rate. Process units that generate 
wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass of less 
than 1 Mg are exempt from the wastewater control 
requirements of the proposed rule. 
The proposed wastewater treatment standard involves the 
application of a controlled collection and treatment system 
to individual wastewater streams that fail the cut off 
criteria. The treatment requirements are designed to reduce 
the VOC content in the wastewater prior to placement in 
units without air emission controls. The proposal includes 
a variety of compliance options in order to meet the 
treatment process standard. These include a recycling 
option involving recycling of the wastewater to a process 
unit, an equipment design and operation standard, a 
numerical emission standard formatted as an effluent 
concentration limit, and a numerical emission standard 
format in terms a mass removal requirement. 
Prior to treatment, the wastewater must be managed in 
units equipped with air emission controls, and wastewater 
collection and treatment systems must be designed and 
operated without leaks, as defined in the standards. 
Following is a summary of the specific standards for each of 
the individual types of SOCMI wastewater units. 


1. Standards for Tanks 


Under the proposed standards, owners and operators 
would be required, with two exceptions, to place wastewater 
streams in one of the following types of tanks depending on 
the tank capacity and vapor pressure of the stored material: 
(1) A tank equipped with a cover (e.g., a fixed roof) and a 
closed vent system and control device that meets certain 
design, inspection, and measurement specifications specified 
in the rules; (2) a tank equipped with a fixed roof and 
internal floating roof that meets the design requirements 
specified under the existing volatile organic liquid (VOL) 
storage NSPS (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb); (3) a tank 
equipped with an external floating roof that meets the 
design, inspection, and measurement requirements specified 
under the existing VOL storage NSPS; or (4) a pressure tank 
that is designed and operated with no pressure releases 
during normal operations including waste loading and 
unloading. 
The proposed rules would provide two exceptions to the 
tank control requirements described above. First, when an 
affected stream (i.e., one in which the wastewater has a 
mass-weighted average volatile organic concentration equal 
to or greater than 500 ppmw) is managed in certain size 
tanks and possesses certain vapor pressure characteristics, 
an owner or operator would be allowed to place the waste in 
a tank equipped with a fixed roof. Second, when the waste 
is placed in a biological treatment tank that meets the 
biological organic degradation performance requirements 
(i.e., 95-percent destruction efficiency), no additional air 
emission controls would be required. 
Each cover opening not vented to a control device would 
be required to be maintained in a closed, sealed position 
except at those times when a specific opening is used to 
add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the tank or to 
inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located 
underneath the cover. Safety devices that vent directly to 
the atmosphere could be used on the cover or closedvent 
system with control device provided that the safety device 
is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors 
and the safety device remains in a closed, sealed position 
at all times except when an unplanned event requires the 
opening of the device. 


2. Standards for Surface Impoundments 


The owner or operator of an affected surface 
impoundment is required to install and use emission control 
equipment. The proposed rules would require owners or 
operators to place waste in a surface impoundment equipped 
with a cover (e.g., air-supported structure) and a closed- 
vent system with control device or, when applicable, a 
surface impoundment equipped with a floating membrane cover 
as the air emission control. If the surface impoundment is 
used for biological treatment that meets the same organic 
biodegradation performance requirements described above for 
tanks, no additional air emission controls would be required 
to be used on the surface impoundment. The proposed 
operating and venting requirements for surface impoundment 
air emission control equipment are consistent with the rule 
requirements for tanks. 


3. Standards for Containers 


The proposed standards would not apply to a container 
that has a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 cubic 
meter (m

3

) (26.4 gallons (gal)). The owner or operator of 
an affected container would be required to place the waste 
material either into a container equipped with a cover that 
operates with no detectable organic emissions when all 
openings are secured in a closed, sealed position or to meet 
the alternative requirements discussed below. 
Alternative requirements under the proposed standards 
for a drum with a design capacity less than or equal to 
0.42 m

3

 (110 gal) would allow an owner or operator to place 
the waste in a drum meeting the Department of Transportation 
(DOT) specifications and testing requirements under 
49 CFR part 178. For a drum meeting these DOT regulations, 
neither Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, leak 
monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation 
is required under the proposed standards. 
Another alternative for containers under the proposed 
standards would require the owner or operator of any 
container that attaches to or forms a part of any truck, 
trailer, or rail car to show that the container has been 
tested for organic vapor tightness within the preceding 
12 months in accordance with the requirements of Method 27 
of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 27 is a pressure test 
procedure originally developed by the EPA for determining 
the vapor-leak tightness of a tank truck into which gasoline 
is placed. The EPA also considers the use of Method 27 to 
be appropriate for determining vapor-leak tightness of 
trucks, trailers, and rail cars into which wastes containing 
volatile organics are placed. Neither Method 21, leak 
monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation 
is required for trucks, trailers, or rail cars complying 
with this provision of the rules.

If a waste is loaded into a container by pumping, the proposed standards would require submerged fill of waste only
into those containers with a capacity equal to or greater than 0.42 m

3

 (110 gal). Accordingly, drums with design capacities up to and including 0.42 m

3

 (110 gal) are not required to be loaded by submerged fill.

When it is necessary for a container to be open during certain treatment processes, the proposed standards would require
the container to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with control device. The enclosure would
be required to be designed to operate with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture all organic vapors vented
from the container and route the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. The enclosure could
have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access, passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor
or other mechanical means, or entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment, or to direct airflow into the
enclosure.



4. Standards for Individual Drain Systems



The proposed rule would require individual drain systems to meet one of two standards. In the first case, the owner
or operator would comply by operating and maintaining on each opening in the individual drain system a cover and closed-vent
system. The covers and all openings and the closed-vent system would meet the leak detection requirements, unless
the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. The cover and all openings would be maintained in a
closed, sealed position at all times when affected wastewater or residual is in the system except when it is necessary
to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair. Each individual
drain system would be subject to initial and semi-annual inspections for improper work practices and control equipment
failures.

Alternatively, individual drain system components would be required to comply with equipment standards. Each drain
would be equipped with water seal controls or a tightly sealed cap or plug to eliminate air flow through the system.
Each junction box would be equipped with a cover and emission controls. Each sewer line would be covered or enclosed
in a manner so as to have no visible gaps or crack in joints, seals, or other emission interfaces. This equipment would
be subject to regular inspection requirements.



5. Standards for Oil-Water Separators



The proposed standards would require owners or operators to operate and maintain either a fixed roof and closed-vent
system that routes the VOC vapors from the oil-water separator to a control device or a floating roof. The fixed roof
and all openings and the closed-vent system would be maintained in accordance with the leak detection requirements
of the proposed rule, unless the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. As with standards for
other waste management units, each opening would be maintained in a closed, sealed position except when it is necessary
to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

Except in cases where it is impossible to operate a floating roof, such as over the weir mechanisms, the owner or operator
would have the option of using a floating roof that meets the requirements of subpart QQQ of 40 CFR part 60. The owner
or operator would measure primary and secondary seal gaps on a periodic basis as well as inspect the oil-water separator
for improper work practices and control equipment failures.



6. Standards for Treatment Processes



The owner or operator would be required to treat each affected wastewater or residual stream by one of the following
methods:

(1) Recycle or return to a production process such that the wastewater stream or residual is not exposed to the atmosphere
and ensure that intervening waste management units meet the applicable requirements of the standards;

(2) Treat using a waste management unit that either is a design steam stripper, reduces by 99 percent or more the total
volatile organic mass flow rate, reduces the average volatile organic concentration to less than 50 ppmw and reduces
the total volatile organic mass by 95 percent, or achieves a required volatile organic mass removal rate for combined
or mixed streams; or

(3) Treat wastewater streams generated by an affected process unit with a biological treatment unit that achieves
95 percent total volatile organic mass removal.

If the treatment process or waste management unit is a properly operated biological treatment unit that meets the
mass removal (i.e., biodegradation) requirements, the biological treatment unit need not be covered and vented
to a control device. However, the owner or operator of any other treatment process or waste management unit subject
to the applicable standards (for example, if the treatment process is a steam stripper, air stripper, or thin-film
evaporation unit) would be required to cover and vent the unit through a closed-vent system to a control device and
meet the leak detection requirements, unless the cover and vent are operated and maintained under negative pressure.
In addition, any openings must be kept closed at all times that an affected wastewater stream or treatment residual
is in the process or unit, except during inspection and maintenance and unless the unit is a properly operated biological
treatment unit as defined by the standards.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940912-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each treatment process or waste management unit used to comply with the treatment processes standards would be required
to provide a design analysis and supporting documentation of the operating characteristics of the treatment process
or waste management unit that is based on operation at a representative wastewater stream flow rate and volatile organic
concentration under which it would be most difficult to demonstrate compliance (i.e., when air emissions are expected
to be highest). Alternatively, the owner or operator may conduct performance tests using the test methods and procedures
specified in the proposed rules to demonstrate compliance. In addition, all openings are subject to periodic inspection
and repair schedules and monitoring requirements.

The proposed rule provides several exceptions to the standards for treatment processes. The owner or operator is
considered to be in compliance with the treatment requirements and is exempt from the demonstration that the treatment
process achieves the required conditions if the treatment process is one of the following: (1) A hazardous waste incinerator
for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 70 and 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or (2)
an industrial furnace or boiler burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit
under 40 CFR part 270 and 40 CFR part 266, subpart H or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements
of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H. In addition, if the affected wastewater stream or residual is discharged to an underground
injection well for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 40 CFR part 122,
the owner is considered in compliance with the treatment provisions.



7. Standards for Control Devices



The proposed standards would require that each control device achieve at least a 95-percent reduction in the total
organic content of the vapor stream vented to the device or, in the case of an enclosed combustion device, a reduction
of the total organic content of the vapor stream to a level less than or equal to 20 ppmw on a dry basis, corrected to 3 percent
oxygen, or provide a minimum residence time and temperature as specified in the proposed standards. Flares would
be required to comply with the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart A. With certain exceptions (e.g., some boilers
and process heaters and flares), compliance would either be demonstrated through a design analysis that addresses
vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters or performance tests would be conducted using
the methods and procedures specified in the proposed rules. In addition, each control device is subject to the enhanced
monitoring and continued compliance requirements of section 114(a) of the CAAA, as well as to periodic inspection
and specified repair periods.

The standards would not require the use of any specific type of equipment or add-on control device. An owner or operator
would be allowed the flexibility of choosing the control device that can achieve the performance requirements and
is best suited for a control application based on the types and characteristics of the particular organic vapor stream.
Furthermore, the standards would not require that each affected waste management unit be vented to a separate control
device dedicated to that particular unit. Vent streams from several units can be combined and discharged to a single
control device that achieves the required level of performance.



H. Modification and Reconstruction



Provisions of the proposed standards would apply to existing facilities that are modified or reconstructed after
the date of proposal. It is possible that at some facilities, feedstock, catalyst, or reactant substitutions; process
equipment changes; or combinations of these two classes of changes above could trigger the part 60 General Provisions
related to modification or reconstruction of facilities. Changes of this nature are likely to require both equipment
and process changes as well as significant capital expenditures. See section IV.H for a more detailed discussion
of these considerations.



I. Compliance Testing



Test methods and procedures would be required to ensure compliance with the standards proposed for SOCMI wastewater
sources. The proposed standards include requirements for demonstrating that an emission point or wastewater stream
is being controlled in compliance with control requirements or would not be required to be controlled. Also included
are provisions for an initial test for no detectable emissions (i.e., leaks as defined in the standards) from tanks,
containers, surface impoundments, closed-vent systems, and process wastewater collection and treatment systems.

<TEXT>
 

Test methods are provided for use by the owner or 
operator in determining applicability of the standards to a 
given wastewater stream. The three variables of concern, 
annual wastewater quantity, average total volatile organic 
concentration, and annual average wastewater flow rate, may 
be determined using a variety of methods. For example, the 
proposed standards include provisions that would allow a 
SOCMI process unit owner or operator to use either direct 
measurement or knowledge of the wastewater to determine the 
volatile organic concentration of the wastewater. Direct 
measurements would be conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of Method 25D in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. 
Knowledge of the wastewater can be demonstrated by material 
balances, records of chemical purchases, process 
stoichiometry, or previous test results. 
A determination of the volatile organic concentration 
or average annual flow rate of a wastewater would be 
required by the proposed standards only when a wastewater 
subject to the standards is placed in a waste management 
unit that is not equipped with air emission controls in 
accordance with the rules. The SOCMI process unit owner or 
operator would not be required to determine the volatile 
organic concentration or average annual flow rate of wastewater streams that are managed only in units equipped with

air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the 
proposed standard up to the point of ultimate recycle, disposal, 
or discharge. 


J. Monitoring Requirements 


To ensure that emission control equipment is properly 
operated and maintained, the proposed standards would require 
the owner or operator to inspect and monitor certain air 
emission control equipment used to comply with the rules. 
Enhanced monitoring of control device operation is required 
under the proposed standards to demonstrate compliance with the 
standards. This involves the use of automated instrumentation 
to measure critical operating parameters that indicate whether 
the control device is operating correctly or is malfunctioning. 
Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored 
parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission 
limits of the standard. 
In addition to the enhanced monitoring requirements, an 
initial leak detection test using Method 21 under appendix A of 
40 CFR part 60 is required for certain cover components to 
ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight.
The 
Method 21 test would be supplemented by annual visual 
inspections for leaking components as well as periodic 
inspection and measurement of other monitoring parameters. 
Special inspection and monitoring provisions are included 
in the proposed standards for cover fittings that 
monitor. Leak monitoring using Method 21 is not required 
for the following: (1) Drums that meet applicable DOT 
regulations specified in the rules; (2) trucks, trailers, 
and rail cars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor 
tight by Method 27 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; and 
(3) closed-vent systems operated under vacuum conditions. 


K. Reporting and Recordkeeping 


The proposed standards require the owner or operator to 
record certain information in the on-site facility operating 
logs or files. The information to be collected and recorded 
includes: the results of all waste determinations such as 
volatile organic concentration at the point of waste 
generation and organic vapor pressure; design specifications 
for closed-vent systems and control devices and control 
equipment; emission control equipment inspection and 
monitoring results; Method 21 and Method 27 test results; 
control device monitoring results; leak repairs; 
identification of incinerators, boilers, or industrial 
furnaces in which wastewater is treated in accordance with 
the general requirements of the rule; documentation for 
biological wastewater treatment units complying with the 
rule; and identification of equipment designated as unsafe 
or difficult to monitor or inspect. This information is to 
be readily available for review by authorized 
representatives of the EPA. The EPA seeks comment on the 
accessibility of the monitoring data and periodic reports 
that may be kept in logs on the plant site when it is not 
required to be reported to the appropriate agency. These 
data and reports should be accessible to citizen groups that 
contemplate citizen suits or other members of the public 
interested in the source's compliance status. This access 
is required by section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act as 
Amended (CAAA). Means of providing that accessibility 
include: direct inspection of the logs or files on-site 
with authority to access the data equal to that of the EPA, 
submission of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to 
the EPA with an affirmative duty on the part of the EPA or 
the state/local delegated agent to obtain any data from the 
source that the agency does not have in its files, 
submission of a FOIA-like request to the source 
owner/operator with an obligation on the part of the 
owner/operator to provide the requested data, or a 
requirement to keep electronic files/logs which would be 
accessible through EPA electronic bulletin boards. Other 
suggestions for meeting the mandates of section 114 are 
welcome.

<TEXT>
 

The General Provisions of 40 CFR part 60 require the 
owner or operator to submit certain notifications and 
reports to the Administrator. Section 60.7(a)(1) of the 
General Provisions requires a notification of the date 
construction or reconstruction of an affected facility is 
commenced; the proposed rule requires that certain general 
information regarding the wastewater generated by the source 
be submitted with this notification. Section 60.7(a)(3) of 
the General Provisions requires a notification of the actual 
date of initial startup of an affected facility; the 
proposed rule requires that the owner or operator provide 
with this notification more detailed information and data on 
the wastewater streams generated by the affected process 
unit. This information includes a determination of whether 
the stream is an affected wastewater stream, the compliance 
approach utilized if the stream is being controlled in 
accordance with the requirements of  60.109(b) of the 
proposed rule, the identification of the waste management 
units receiving or managing each affected wastewater stream, 
and certain information on the treatment processes and 
control devices used to comply with the rule. 
Section 60.7(c) of the General Provisions requires that 
each owner or operator required to install a continuous 
monitoring system (CMS) or monitoring device submit an 
excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report 
and/or a summary report to the Administrator on a quarterly 
basis when the CMS data are to be used directly for 
compliance determination, as is the case for control devices 
in this proposed rule. In order to be consistent with the 
reporting requirements of the HON, which also regulates this 
industry, the EPA is exempting the owner or operator from 
the quarterly reporting requirement and is requiring only a 
semiannual report in the proposed rule. The semiannual 
report will contain information on the excursions or 
exceedances as determined by the CMS data, performance test 
results, and other information on treatment processes and 
control devices. 


III. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS 


To estimate the impacts of the proposed regulation, the 
EPA estimates the quantity of VOC that the affected industry 
would emit to the atmosphere in the absence of the rule. 
This estimated quantity serves as a baseline from which the 
impacts of the rule are measured. Following estimation of 
the baseline level of emissions, the Agency estimates the 
emission reduction that would occur as a result of the 
regulatory alternatives for the rule. Studies are then made 
to estimate the impacts of the rule on the environment, the 
economics of the industry and the nation, and on energy 
consumption. Collectively, these estimates represent the 
impacts of the standard. Estimated impacts include emission 
reductions, costs, impacts on non-air environmental media, 
and energy usage. The impacts presented here are those 
estimated to occur in the fifth year after promulgation. 
All of the impacts are calculated as an increment 
relative to the impacts of the wastewater rules included in 
the HON. Additional details of the impacts analysis can be 
found in the BID and from documentation developed in support 
of the HON. 


A. Environmental Impacts 


Under the proposed NSPS, it is estimated that 
68 percent of all new SOCMI chemical production process 
units would have wastewater streams that require control 
under the NSPS but do not require control under the HON. It 
is further estimated that the total annual emission 
reduction achieved by the NSPS in the fifth year would be 
approximately 16,200 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) of VOC. 
Because the NSPS requires the treatment of wastewater prior 
to discharge, there would be no negative impacts on water 
quality. In fact, the impacts of the rule on water quality 
could be positive. Impacts of the rule on solid waste are 
estimated to be negligible. 
Other environmental impacts of the rule are estimated 
to be small. Due to the increased energy requirements of 
control, emissions of carbon monoxide are estimated to 
increase by about 4 Mg/yr and emissions of nitrogen oxides 
are estimated to increase by about 35 Mg/yr. Energy impacts 
of the proposed rule include the combustion of fossil fuels 
to generate steam for steam stripping systems. These 
impacts are partially offset by the recovery of organics 
from the treatment system. Estimated energy impacts of the 
proposed rule in the fifth year consist of an increase of 
0.6 million kilowatt hours per year (Kw-hr/yr) of 
electricity usage, an increase in natural gas consumption of 
133 million British thermal units per year (Btu/yr), and an 
increase in steam usage of 133 billion Btu/yr.

B. Cost Impacts


The fifth-year cost impacts of the proposed standard 
are considered to be reasonable. Total annualized cost of 
the rule in the fifth year, on a nationwide basis, is 
estimated at $8.8 million. This results in a cost 
effectiveness of about $540 per Mg of emission reduction. 
The fifth-year national capital cost is estimated at 
approximately $5.8 million. The estimated cost impacts 
assume that most of the regulated SOCMI plants with affected 
process units have an existing steam stripping system with 
sufficient excess capacity to treat the wastewater streams 
regulated under the NSPS or will be able to modify steam 
stripping systems that are currently being designed and 
constructed for compliance with other regulations (e.g., the 
HON) to add sufficient capacity to treat the wastewater 
streams covered by the proposed NSPS that do not require 
control under these other regulations. The estimate also 
assumes that a small number (about 12 percent) do not have 
an existing steam stripper and will have to install a new 
system. These assumptions reflect the Agency's best 
estimate of the way the industry will comply with the rule. 


C. Economic Impacts 


The proposed rule is not expected to pose significant 
adverse economic impacts. The impact estimates are also 
produced assuming the costs of control are passed on to the 
consumer, as is the case in competitive markets in the long 
run. The EPA estimates, on average, a maximum price 
increase of less than 1 percent for SOCMI chemicals. This 
assumes the entire mix of chemicals produced by an affected 
SOCMI facility are proportionately affected by the NSPS, and 
assumes that the chemicals produced at those SOCMI 
facilities in the EPA database are reasonably representative 
of the mix of chemicals in the industry. The market price 
impacts of specific chemicals may be greater than the 
average presented above. This may be especially true for 
affected chemicals produced in low volumes and affected 
chemicals that have lower-than-average market prices. 
Chemicals with lower-than-average prices could experience 
higher-than-average control costs per unit of revenue. Due 
to economies of scale in pollution control, affected 
chemicals that are produced in low volumes are likely to 
have a higher-than-average cost of control per unit of 
production. The feature of the proposed rule that exempts 
low volume wastewater streams from selected process units 
may mitigate the price impact of low production volume 
chemicals that produce low volume waste streams. Finally, 
there will be no adverse effects on industry employment or 
expansion because the proposed standards will not 
appreciably affect the demand for chemicals covered by these 
standards.

IV. Rationale for Proposed Standards 


A. Selection of Source Category 


Under section 111(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the 
Administrator is required to publish, and periodically 
update, a list of source categories that in his or her 
judgement cause, or contribute significantly to, air 
pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
public health or welfare. This list appears in 40 CFR 60.16 
and ranks, in order of priority for standards development, 
various source categories in terms of quantities of 
nationwide pollutant emission, the mobility and competitive 
nature of each source category, and the extent to which each 
pollutant endangers public health and welfare. The priority 
list reflects the Administrator's determination that 
emissions from the listed source categories contribute 
significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, and it is 
intended to identify major source categories for which 
standards of performance are to be promulgated.
 
The priority list ranks the SOCMI source category first 
out of 59 listed source categories. For regulatory 
purposes, the SOCMI category was divided into the following 
segments: SOCMI unit processes; volatile organic liquid 
(VOL) storage vessels and handling equipment; SOCMI fugitive 
sources; and SOCMI wastewater sources. Standards have been 
developed for the other three groups of SOCMI sources; the 
NSPS proposes standards for the fourth and final category of 
SOCMI sources. 
This division of the source category on the basis of 
similar types of emission sources and applicable emission 
control techniques was chosen over a more traditional 
approach for NSPS that involves the development of standards 
applicable to each specific chemical process. The selected 
approach is more resource efficient than the chemical 
process approach because a large number of specific chemical 
processes can be covered by one regulation. In addition, 
SOCMI plants contain similar wastewater emission sources. 
Similarities in the behavior of wastewater emission sources 
in SOCMI allow the same control techniques to be applied to 
all of the processes. Therefore, because the control 
techniques can be applied to the entire industry group and 
because regulating the entire group would be more resource 
efficient, a single regulation is being proposed for 
controlling wastewater emissions from the SOCMI source 
category. 
The SOCMI is a large and diverse industry producing 
several thousand intermediate and end-product chemicals from 
a small number of basic chemicals. Most of the chemicals 
produced by this industry fall under standard industrial 
classification code 286. 
In the proposed rule, a SOCMI process unit is defined 
as one producing or using one or more of the chemicals 
listed in the regulation. The list of chemicals proposed is 
an inclusive list that was derived from several sources that 
also formed the basis for the initial list of chemicals used 
to characterize SOCMI process units in the HON (see 
appendix A of the HON BID, EPA-453/D-92-016). The following 
sources are the basis for the composite list of chemicals 
for the proposed NSPS: (1) ``Industrial Organic Chemical Use 
Trees,'' EPA/ORD, October 1992; (2) Standards of Performance 
for Equipment Leaks of VOC in SOCMI, 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart VV; (3) Proposed Standards of Performance for SOCMI 
Reactor Processes, 55 FR 26953, June 29, 1990; (4) Standards 
of Performance for SOCMI Distillation Operations, 
40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN; and (5) Standards of 
Performance for SOCMI Air Oxidation Processes, 
40 CFR part 60, subpart III. Therefore, the proposed list 
is a compilation of all the chemicals in these databases 
used to characterize the SOCMI process units. 


B. Selection of Emission Sources 


There are several emission sources associated with 
SOCMI processes (e.g., process vents, product storage and 
transfer operations, and equipment leaks); however, this 
NSPS is directed toward the control of VOC emissions from 
wastewater generated by SOCMI process units. This includes 
emissions from wastewater collection and treatment 
operations. Wastewater streams that contain organic 
compounds are generated at SOCMI process units by one of two 
mechanisms, either direct contact of water with organic 
compounds or by contamination of indirect contact water 
through equipment leaks in chemical processing. 
Water may come in direct contact with organic compounds 
during a variety of different chemical processing steps, 
thus generating wastewater streams (referred to as ``process 
wastewater'') that must be discharged for treatment or 
disposal. Direct contact wastewater includes water used to 
wash impurities from organic compound products or reactants, 
water used to cool or quench organic compound vapor streams, 
condensed steam from jet educator systems pulling vacuum on 
vessels containing organic compounds, water from raw 
material and product storage tanks, water used as a carrier 
for catalysts and neutralizing agents (e.g., caustic 
solutions), and water formed as a byproduct during chemical 
reactions. Direct contact wastewater is also generated 
within SOCMI process units when water is used in equipment 
washes and spill cleanups; this wastewater (referred to as 
``maintenance wastewater'') is typically more variable in flow 
rate and concentration than process wastewater streams and 
may be collected in ways that differ from process 
wastewater. 
Indirect contact wastewater streams are generated by 
unintentional contact with organic compounds through leaks 
in process equipment. For example, indirect contact 
wastewater may be generated as a result of leaks from heat 
exchangers, condensers, or pumps. These wastewaters also 
may be collected and treated differently from direct contact 
wastewaters.

<TEXT>
 

In both the SOCMI NSPS and the HON, ``wastewater'' is 
defined to encompass both process wastewaters and 
maintenance wastewaters. Examples of process wastewater 
streams include, but are not limited to, wastewater streams 
exiting process unit equipment (e.g., decanter water, such 
as condensed steam used in the process), product tank 
drawdown, feed tank drawdown, filter-press filtrate, and 
residuals recovered from waste management units. Examples 
of maintenance wastewater streams, which encompass all 
maintenance-related wastewater streams, are those generated 
by descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of 
distillation traps, and draining of pumps into an individual 
drain system. However, the regulatory approach taken in the 
SOCMI NSPS is different from the one taken in the final HON. 
The proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS requires that controls be 
applied to reduce air emissions from both process and 
maintenance wastewater streams from SOCMI process units that 
produce any of the listed chemicals. In the HON, 
maintenance wastewater is regulated by subpart F, and 
process wastewater is regulated by subpart G. Subpart F, 
 63.105, requires the source owner or operator to develop a 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which includes a 
description of procedures for managing wastewaters generated 
during maintenance. In the final HON, the facility's plan 
must include a description of procedures that will ensure 
that all maintenance wastewater is properly managed and HAP 
emissions are controlled. No such plan is required in the 
proposed NSPS. 

The EPA selected the regulatory approach for 
maintenance wastewater as proposed in the NSPS because it 
was determined through review of the industry, which 
included plant visits to newly constructed SOCMI process 
units, that the technologies available for the collection 
and treatment of these wastewaters have been adequately 
demonstrated at SOCMI plants. The EPA is soliciting 
comments on the proposed approach to regulating SOCMI 
process unit maintenance wastewaters. The EPA is interested 
in receiving information on why new SOCMI process units 
could not be designed and operated to control air emissions 
from maintenance wastewaters in the same manner as process 
wastewaters and information on the impact the small-quantity 
cutoff for process units and the low-flow exemption for 
wastewater streams will have on the collection and treatment 
of SOCMI maintenance wastewaters in relation to air emission 
control. 

Wastewater streams at SOCMI plants are collected and 
treated in a variety of ways. Generally, wastewater passes 
through a series of collection and treatment units before 
being recycled to the facility or discharged from the 
facility. Collection and treatment schemes for wastewater 
are facility specific. The flow rate and organic compound 
composition of wastewater streams at a particular plant are 
functions of the processes used, which in turn influence the 
sizes and types of collection and treatment units. Many of 
the collection and treatment system units are either 
directly or indirectly open to the atmosphere; this 
atmospheric interface creates a potential for VOC emissions. 
The magnitude of VOC emissions from SOCMI process unit 
wastewaters is dependent on factors such as the physical 
properties of the pollutants, the temperature of the 
wastewater, and the design of the individual collection and 
treatment unit managing the wastewater. Climatic factors 
such as ambient temperature and wind speed also affect VOC 
emissions at many wastewater collection and treatment units. 
Potential sources of VOC emissions associated with 
wastewater collection and treatment systems include 
individual drain systems, manholes, junction boxes, lift 
stations, trenches, sumps, weirs, oil-water separators, 
equalization or neutralization basins, clarifiers, aeration 
basins, storage and treatment tanks, surface impoundments, 
and containers. A discussion of each of these emission 
sources is contained in Chapter 3 of the BID. 



C. Pollutants to be Regulated 



New source performance standards are developed under 
the authority of section 111 of the Act. Section 111 of the 
Act requires the regulation of new and modified sources of 
criteria pollutants (identified under section 110 of the 
Act) and certain other designated pollutants.

<TEXT>
 

Volatile organic compounds are regulated due to their 
contribution to the formation of ozone in the lower 
atmosphere. Ozone is a listed criteria pollutant. Exposure 
to ozone has been linked to both health and welfare impacts. 
Health and welfare risks from these include impaired 
respiratory function, eye irritation, deterioration of 
materials such as rubber, and necrosis of plant tissue. 

The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be 
assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at 
its point of generation. Based on information and data 
gathered on the concentration of organics in SOCMI 
wastewater streams and on the flow rate of these streams, 
the VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater streams are 
considered to cause or contribute significantly to air 
pollution. 



D. Selection of Affected Facility 



The choice of the affected facility for an NSPS is 
based on the Agency's interpretation of section 111 of the 
Act. Under section 111, the NSPS must apply to ``new 
sources''; ``source'' is defined as any building, structure, 
facility, or installation which emits or may emit ``any air 
pollutant.'' Most industrial plants, however, consist of 
numerous pieces or groups of equipment which emit air 
pollutants, and which might be viewed as ``sources.'' The EPA 
uses the term ``affected facility'' to designate the 
equipment, within a particular kind of plant, which is 
chosen as the ``source'' covered by a given standard. 

In choosing the affected facility, the EPA must decide 
which pieces or groups of equipment are the appropriate 
units for separate emission standards in the particular 
industrial context involved and in light of the terms and 
purpose of section 111. One major consideration in this 
examination is that the use of a broader definition means 
that replacement equipment is less likely to be regulated 
under the NSPS; if, for example, an entire plant were 
designated as the affected facility, no part of the plant 
would be covered by the standard unless the plant as a whole 
were ``modified.'' Because the purpose of section 111 is to 
minimize emissions by the application of the best 
demonstrated control technology (considering cost, other 
health and environmental effects, and energy requirements) 
at all new and modified sources, there is a presumption that 
a narrower designation of the affected facility is 
appropriate. This ensures that new emission sources within 
plants will be brought under the coverage of the standards 
as they are installed. This presumption can be overcome, 
however, if the Agency concludes that the relevant statutory 
factors (technical feasibility, cost, energy, and other 
environmental impacts) point to a broader definition. 
Another factor considered in the selection of an affected 
facility for the NSPS is the definition used in existing 
environmental rules. The application of these factors is 
discussed below.

The SOCMI is normally represented as a system of production stages that produce a wide range of organic chemicals from
a set of 11 basic chemicals. The basic set of 11 chemicals is generated by refineries, natural gas plants, and coal tar
distillation plants. Organic chemicals are produced at a wide range of facilities, from large facilities manufacturing
a few chemicals in large volumes, to smaller facilities manufacturing many different finished chemicals in smaller
volumes. Each of the production stages or ``process units'' may include any of several VOC emission sources, one of
which is collection and treatment of wastewater. 

Three alternatives were considered for defining the affected facility in the NSPS. One option considered was to use
a variation of the definition of source used in the HON, which is ``* * * the set of emission points
in the organic HAP-emitting processes used to produce synthetic organic chemicals that are in a contiguous area under
common control.'' Under this option of broadly defining the source for the NSPS, the affected facility would include
all process units and associated process unit wastewater streams located at a plant with SOCMI process units. A second
option considered was the narrow definition used in the NSPS for refinery wastewater (40 CFR part 60, subpart QQQ),
which was ``(1) individual drain systems, (2) oil-water separators, and (3) aggregate facilities, which are defined
as all process drains connected to the first common downstream junction box down to the receiving oil-water separator.''
The third and final option considered was ``each individual SOCMI process unit'' where each SOCMI process unit is
defined as the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts that use or produce, as intermediates or final products,
one or more of the chemicals listed in the NSPS applicability section. (A process unit can be operated independently
if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.) 

The broader first option has been used previously by the EPA in an existing NESHAP (i.e., the HON) as the source definition
for existing SOCMI facilities. (Note: Under the HON's new source provisions, new SOCMI process units are subject
to the rule requirements under a more narrow source definition when specified conditions are met.) In that regulation,
the definition was purposely chosen to be broad to include all emission points at any given site under the regulation.
As stated earlier, a broad definition under an NSPS has a different effect. If an entire site is designated as the affected
facility for an NSPS, existing sources only become subject to the NSPS if the entire site is modified or reconstructed.


Under the second option, each piece of equipment in the wastewater collection and treatment system would be considered
a unique or individual affected facility. This definition, which has a precedent in the refinery wastewater NSPS,
is much narrower and more restrictive than the first option. In general, the narrower the definition of source, the
more likely it is that changes to existing facilities will be deemed ``new sources'' under the Act. This definition
would result in numerous sources within each SOCMI process unit, as well as numerous sources within the wastewater
collection and treatment system, being classified as affected facilities. 

The third option, that of considering each process unit as an affected facility, also has recent precedent. The standards
for process wastewater components of the proposed pulp and paper rule (58 FR 66077, December 17, 1993) are structured
such that the process unit is the affected facility, and controls are required for wastewater streams generated by
these units. This approach is also consistent with the one taken in the HON for regulation of new SOCMI process units.
Defining the affected facility on a process unit basis avoids the problems associated with having multiple individual
collection and treatment system equipment components classified as affected facilities, and it also provides a
definition sufficiently narrow in scope so as not to preclude the possibility that existing sources will become subject
to the NSPS through the modification and reconstruction provisions. Most importantly, defining an affected facility
as a process unit reflects industry construction practices. Almost all new construction, reconstruction, and modification
in the SOCMI is carried out by process unit.

After carefully considering each of the above alternatives, the EPA selected process units as the basis for defining
affected facilities for the proposed NSPS. This definition allows for routine equipment replacement and minor changes
or expansions in existing facilities without subjecting either single emission sources or entire plant sites to
requirements of the proposed standards. Providing for full coverage of all new process units will improve ambient
air quality, the goal of standards implemented under section 111. 

Synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry process units, which are defined as the equipment assembled
and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product, include reactors
and their associated product separators and recovery devices; distillation units and their associated distillate
receivers and recovery devices; associated unit operations; and any feed, intermediate, and product storage vessels,
product transfer racks, and connected ducts and piping. A synthetic organic chemical manufacturing process unit
includes pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves
or lines, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and control devices or systems. 



E. Selection of Best Demonstrated Technology 



Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect the degree of emission limitation and the percentage reduction
achievable through application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction which (taking
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impact
and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.'' The technological
basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the standards
development process for NSPS, BDT should be identified, the performance of BDT established, and a regulatory alternative
selected that will require the use of BDT or an equivalent technology. 

There are two fundamentally different approaches to controlling VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater sources. The
first is a source reduction or waste minimization approach in which the emission reduction is achieved through a reduction
in the quantity of wastewater generated and/or a reduction in the VOC content of the wastewater as a result of process
modifications, modifications of operating practices, improved preventive maintenance activities, increased
recycling, or segregation of VOC-containing waste streams. 

Waste minimization may be achieved through either source reduction or recycling. Source reduction involves the
implementation of steps that reduce either the amount of wastewater generated or the amount of VOC contained in the
wastewater streams. Recycling includes recovery and/or reuse of potential wastes. Within the SOCMI, there are several
means of achieving the objective of either of these waste minimization alternatives. However, in relation to SOCMI
wastewater, waste minimization techniques are, for the most part, process unit-specific, and the degree of emission
reduction achieved depends on the operating parameters of the individual process unit. 

Because of a lack of adequate site-specific data regarding the waste minimization approach within SOCMI, the EPA
was unable to develop reasonable estimates of the emission control efficiency of the waste minimization options
achievable on a nationwide basis. For example, because pollution prevention activities such as process redesign
are site-specific, it would not be practical or possible to stipulate specific requirements for the large number
of chemical production processes subject to the proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS. In addition, the EPA considers that
elimination of pollution through material substitution will not be possible in all cases within the SOCMI because
SOCMI products cannot be eliminated from use without adverse economic impact. Specifically, because the products
of the SOCMI are used in the production of polymers, resins, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, etc., elimination of a
SOCMI product would affect not only the SOCMI producer but also the downstream user of that SOCMI product. Many of the
end-use products (e.g., resins, pharmaceuticals, etc.) could not be made from other materials. Thus, the EPA maintains
that material substitution is better left determined by the marketplace than by mandate through a specific Federal
requirement. Therefore, for the reasons cited above, no waste minimization options were included in the regulatory
alternatives analysis for this NSPS. 

The EPA, however, believes that the SOCMI wastewater NSPS sufficiently encourages pollution prevention. For example,
within the regulation's applicability provisions, there is an exemption from the control requirements of the rule
for process units that generate wastewaters with small overall volatile organic quantities in the wastewater. Also,
the regulatory criteria for identifying the wastewater streams that require control for air emissions are expressed
in terms of action levels based on concentration and flow rate cutoffs below which controls are not required for the
wastewater stream. An owner or operator may use any means, including process changes or material substitution but
not treatment of the wastewater, to meet the criteria for either the small quantity process unit exemption or the concentration/low-flow
cutoff. In addition, within the provisions for wastewater collection and treatment operations, there are compliance
options that only specify a percent reduction of VOC emissions. Again, to comply with these options, an owner or operator
may use any means, including process changes or recovery devices, to reduce emissions by the specified percent.

The second approach to achieving emission reductions 
involves emission suppression and treatment of wastewater 
streams to remove or destroy the organic compounds. 
Volatile organic compound emissions from SOCMI process unit 
wastewater can be effectively reduced on a nationwide basis 
with the following control approach: (1) Identify 
wastewater streams with significant VOC emission potential; 
(2) recycle or treat those wastewater streams to remove 
their potential for emissions; (3) prior to treatment or 
recycling, manage those waste streams in units that suppress 
emissions or are equipped with air emission controls; 
(4) recycle any treatment residuals or treat any residuals 
to destroy VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by 
the treatment processes. 


The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be 
assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at 
its point of generation. A reference test method, EPA 
Method 25D (40 CFR Part 60, appendix A), provides a relative 
indicator of wastewater emission potential and is used as a 
tool to implement air emission standards for wastewater. 
This method, when applied to a wastewater stream, yields a 
volatile organic concentration for the stream. While not a 
true indicator of absolute emissions, the volatile organic 
content of a stream provides a relative indicator of the 
potential emissions of that stream as compared to other 
streams that are similarly managed. 


There are three primary treatment technologies that are 
generally applicable and effective in reducing the VOC 
content of SOCMI wastewater streams. These are steam 
stripping, air stripping, and biological treatment. There 
also are several other technologies or methods of treatment 
that are equally effective in their particular situations 
but are limited in their applicability within SOCMI. These 
other technologies include chemical oxidation, carbon and 
ion exchange adsorption, membrane separation, and 
liquid-liquid extraction. 


Steam stripping is the most universally applicable VOC 
removal technology for treating wastewater streams generated 
by SOCMI process units, and this treatment technology has 
been selected as the basis for standards for SOCMI 
wastewater. The VOC removal efficiency of steam strippers 
depends on the characteristics of both the steam stripper 
and the wastewater stream. Data collected by the EPA 
related to steam stripper performance for the treatment of 
wastewaters indicate that organic removal efficiencies of up 
to 99.9 percent have been demonstrated on wastewater streams 
at SOCMI plants. 


The EPA selected steam stripping as the BDT because it 
is the most universally applicable treatment technology for 
removing organic compounds from wastewater streams with the 
potential to emit VOC and achieves the highest VOC emission 
reduction among demonstrated VOC control technologies. The 
EPA is aware that many SOCMI facilities employ biological 
treatment units for wastewater treatment. However, not all 
of the compounds regulated under the proposed NSPS are 
significantly biodegradable, while most of the compounds can 
be treated more readily by steam stripping. In addition, 
the amount of emissions reduction achieved by biological 
treatment, even for biologically degradable compounds, will 
vary among SOCMI sources because of the ranges in operating 
and design parameters, such as the biological degradation 
rate, surface area of the unit, aeration rate, hydraulic 
residence time, and the active biomass concentration. When 
reviewing biological treatment as the potential BDT, the EPA 
determined that the variability in performance is 
significant across the industry. Although a well operated 
and maintained biological treatment system can achieve 
reductions as high as 99 percent, the variability in 
performance makes quantifying emission reductions for the 
purpose of setting a standard more difficult than for steam 
stripping. Emission reductions for biological treatment 
systems can only be determined on a site-specific basis. 
However, the EPA emphasizes that SOCMI sources using 
biological treatment, or any other treatment technologies, 
can comply with the rule by consistently achieving the 
required emission reduction (i.e., 95 percent when using 
biodegradation or 99 percent for other technologies).

To achieve the desired emission reduction from steam 
stripping or other treatment technology, it is necessary to 
suppress the wastewater emissions from the point of 
generation to the treatment device where the organic 
compounds are either removed or destroyed. Suppression of 
emissions can be achieved by using physical covers, roofs, 
and water seals to minimize the contact between the 
wastewater and the atmosphere. Examples of controls for air 
emissions from waste management units in a wastewater 
collection and treatment system, based on suppression 
techniques, include: fixed or floating roofs on tanks, 
water seals on drains, gas-tight covers on junction boxes, 
and covers and enclosures around oil-water separators. Hard 
piping of a wastewater stream from its point of generation 
to the steam stripper unit is one method to achieve the 
suppression of air emission from the wastewater. However, 
wastewater streams may be managed in other units prior to 
treatment if those units are equipped with air emission 
controls. 





F. Selection of Format of Proposed Standard 




Section 111 of the Act requires an emission standard 
whenever it is feasible. Section 111(h) states that ``if in 
the judgment of the Administrator, it is not feasible to 
prescribe or enforce a standard of performance, he may 
instead promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or 
operational standard, or combination thereof * * * '' The term 
``not feasible'' is applicable if the emissions cannot be 
captured and vented through a vent or stack designed for 
that purpose, or if the application of a measurement 
methodology is not practicable because of technological or 
economic limitations. The EPA is proposing standards for 
VOC emissions from the process unit wastewater segment of 
this source category. To ensure that emissions are captured 
and conveyed to a control device, the proposed standards 
include requirements for: 


(1) An enclosed wastewater collection and treatment 
system; 


(2) Treatment to reduce VOC concentration in the 
wastewater streams; and 


(3) Conveyance of emissions vented from the wastewater 
treatment device and the enclosed wastewater 
collection system in a closed-vent system to a 
control device. 





Applicability levels are included in the SOCMI wastewater 
standards to identify those process unit wastewater streams 
that are required to be controlled. Alternative formats 
were considered for applicability levels, waste management 
units, wastewater treatment processes, and vent collection 
and vapor recovery or destruction devices. 




1. Applicability Levels 




The EPA identified certain low flow and low 
concentration wastewater streams that are not believed to be 
controlled at existing facilities. Parameters that 
characterize these streams include volatile organic 
concentration of the stream and volumetric flow rate, both 
of which can be determined by using a variety of methods. 
Therefore, the EPA is proposing concentration and flow rate 
parameters to identify process unit wastewater streams that 
do not require control. The EPA also is proposing that 
process units that generate wastewater with a total annual 
mass of volatile organics less than 1 Mg per year are exempt 
from the control requirements of the rule. The EPA solicits 
comment on whether it is feasible to otherwise identify 
specific process unit wastewater streams to be controlled. 
The EPA also solicits information on defining these process 
unit wastewater streams. 




2. Waste Management Units 




Two formats were considered in developing the proposed 
standards for waste management units. These formats were a 
numerical emission standard and an equipment and work 
practice standard. A numerical standard would not be 
feasible because it would be difficult to capture and 
measure emissions from SOCMI waste management units (i.e., 
tanks, surface impoundments, containers, individual drain 
systems, and oil-water separators) for the purpose of 
evaluating compliance. Due to the number of openings and 
possible emissions points, accurate measurement would 
require enclosure of the entire airspace around each piece 
of equipment. This approach would not be practical for 
numerous equipment components. Therefore, the Administrator 
concluded that the format of the standards for this source 
category should include a combination of a design, 
equipment, work practice, and operational standards. 


In the case of SOCMI waste management units, the intent 
of the standard is to suppress and capture emissions from 
the process unit wastewater collection and treatment 
equipment. The suppression and capture of emissions is 
accomplished by the installation and proper maintenance of 
roofs, covers, lids, water seals, and enclosures on tanks, 
surface impoundments, containers, individual drain systems, 
and oil-water separators. Captured emissions are then 
vented to a control device through application of a closed 
vent system. Work practices such as periodic monitoring, 
inspection, and repair, would be required to ensure proper 
operation and maintenance of the equipment. 


The proposed standards would require that emissions 
from waste management units be controlled from the point of 
generation until the wastewater stream leaves the treatment 
device or is recycled to the process. 




3. Wastewater Treatment Processes 




Three formats were considered in developing the 
proposed standards for reduction of process unit wastewater 
stream VOC concentration: a numerical format (i.e., 
emission standard), an equipment design and operational 
format, and an equipment and work practice standard.

a. 

Emission Limitation. 

Three alternative numerical emission limitation formats are proposed to provide sources with a maximum degree of
operational flexibility in complying with the standards. These emission limitation formats are: a mass percent
reduction of VOC in the process unit wastewater stream, an effluent concentration limitation for VOC for individual
wastewater streams, or a mass removal requirement for combined wastewater streams. The rationale for providing
these alternative emission limitations is discussed below. 

The percent reduction format is based on the VOC removal efficiency of a steam stripper; however, any treatment process
that can achieve the proposed efficiency can be used to comply with the standard. (See section IV.G for more discussion.)
Percent reduction was chosen because it is the best representation of control technology performance, and it may
be applied to any configuration of wastewater streams. 

The effluent concentration limitations are also based on the performance of a steam stripper. Effluent concentration
limitations are provided as alternatives to the percent reduction standard to allow compliance flexibility for
facilities required to treat process unit wastewater streams. The use of this alternative is limited to facilities
that are treating only affected wastewater streams. The effluent concentration limit is not applicable to situations
where combinations or mixtures of both affected and unaffected wastewater streams are treated. 

Dilution becomes a concern when more than one waste stream is sent to a single treatment process. For example, diluting
a waste with other materials having a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw as a means by which an owner
or operator lowers the volatile organic concentration of the waste from an affected stream to a level below 500 ppmw
would not comply with the requirements of the proposed standards. A process that simply mixes, blends, combines,
or aggregates a waste with other materials does not destroy the VOC in the waste or remove the VOC from the waste. Consequently,
when a waste is treated by an organic destruction or removal process, and the waste has been mixed or aggregated together
with other wastes or materials with a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw prior to the point of waste
treatment, the proposed standards would require that owners or operators meet special requirements to ensure that
organics in the waste have actually been removed or destroyed. Under the proposed rules, an owner or operator would
be allowed to use a mass reduction requirement to meet the standards. 

Required mass removal is an alternative for combined wastewater streams. This provision would require that mixed
wastes be treated by an organic destruction or removal process that reduces the volatile organic concentration of
the waste to meet a site-specific treatment process mass removal limit. This limit would be determined by the owner
or operator on a case-by-case basis using an equation specified in the rules that accounts for the reduction in the
volatile organic concentration of the resulting treated waste stream due to dilution. To use this equation, the owner
or operator would first determine the volatile organic concentration at the point of waste entry for each individual
waste stream that is mixed together prior to entering the treatment process. 

b. 

Equipment Design and Operation Format. 

Another regulatory format proposed for process unit wastewater stream treatment is an equipment design and operational
format. The equipment standard consists of the installation of a steam stripper designed and operated at specified
parametric levels. The specifications for the steam stripper were developed to provide a standard piece of equipment
(with associated operating conditions) that can achieve either the mass percent VOC removal or the effluent concentration
of VOC. 

This equipment design and operational format was included to provide an alternative means of compliance that all
sources would be able to use, while achieving the desired emission reduction. 

c. 

Equipment and Work Practice Format. 

A final equivalent standard proposed for controlling process unit wastewater emissions is an equipment and work
practice standard. This format is based on the recycling of process unit wastewater in a closed collection system
to the process. When recycling is used, process unit wastewater emissions are controlled with equipment emissions,
and the process unit wastewater is reused. This format is proposed to encourage chemical recovery and waste minimization
and pollution prevention. 



4. Vent Collection and Vapor Recovery or Destruction Devices 



An emission standard and two equipment and design standards are proposed for VOC that are routed to vapor recovery
or destruction devices used to control VOC from vent collection sources. The proposed emission standard includes
two alternatives: a weight percent reduction and an outlet concentration. A mass emission limit was not appropriate
for these emission points because variation within the industry, including capacity and processes, greatly affects
emission rates, and data were not available to determine the mass limits that would address this variation. In general,
a weight percent reduction format will ensure that BDT is applied and the required emission reductions are realized.
However, combustion technology that is equivalent to BDT cannot be demonstrated to achieve the selected percent
reduction for streams with low VOC concentrations. Therefore, an alternative concentration limit that is achievable
has been included. The combination of the weight percent reduction or concentration limit will ensure that the best
technology is applied to all SOCMI process emission points, whether they have higher or lower concentrations.

Two equivalent standards, each of which is an equipment and design standard, are also proposed. The first equipment
and design standard is the requirement that gas streams be routed to a combustion device (other than flares) designed
and operated at a minimum temperature and residence time. For flares, an equipment standard with stated equipment
and operating specifications is being proposed as the format because it is very difficult to measure emissions from
a flare to determine its efficiency. These standards have been determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission
standards and are proposed to provide maximum compliance flexibility. 



G. Selection of Standards 



This section discusses the rationale for the selection of the standards for the SOCMI process unit wastewater source
category. The selection of applicability levels, numerical limitations for the emission standards, and design
parameters are included. 



1. Applicability Levels 



For the purposes of developing wastewater standards, the EPA has concluded that the effectiveness of the control
technologies available to limit VOC emissions from wastewater does not vary. Controls are assumed to be either ``on''
or ``off,'' depending on whether a particular stream is identified as one that must be controlled. Therefore, the
basic foundation of the proposed provisions for SOCMI process unit wastewater is to identify wastewater streams
for control and treatment based on a specific criteria or action level at the point of wastewater generation, prior
to dilution and air emissions losses. Control of a wastewater stream is triggered if it is determined that the stream
exceeds the action level established by the standard. With this approach, the primary decision that needs to be made
in establishing BDT is selecting the appropriate action level for the source category. 

Regulatory alternatives for a standard to control emissions from wastewater have, in previous EPA regulatory analyses,
been typically expressed in terms of action levels based on a concentration cutoff above which a wastewater stream
must be controlled. For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the primary action level will be defined in terms of the volatile
organic concentration, as measured by method 25D. The standard also includes exemptions for low flow streams. This
is in consideration of the fact that, even though a waste stream may exceed an action level, the total mass of contaminant
present in a stream with a low flow rate is low enough that the waste or wastewater stream does not have the potential
for significant emissions. Process units that generate wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass less
than 1 Mg are also exempt from the control requirements of the proposed rule. The impacts analysis indicated that the
1 Mg/yr small quantity exemption has little effect on the emission reductions achieved under the regulatory alternatives
examined while significantly reducing the overall cost of compliance. 

The five regulatory alternatives analyzed in the development of the proposed standard were combinations of volatile
organic concentrations and flow rate cutoffs. The alternatives were analyzed both with and without the small quantity
cutoff of 1 Mg per year of volatile organic mass. For each regulatory alternative, steam stripping (or an equivalent
emission reduction technique) would be required for all wastewater streams with flow rates and volatile organic
concentrations greater than their respective action levels. 

Values were chosen for concentration and flow rate cutoffs to span ranges believed by the EPA to be reasonable based
on knowledge of the SOCMI wastewater streams to be regulated and on previous standards development efforts. Further,
the ranges of flow rates and concentrations represented in these alternatives, when impacts are estimated, illustrate
the range of cost-effectiveness levels that apply to regulatory alternatives and allow selection of an alternative
that will achieve optimum control (i.e., greatest emission reduction for lowest cost). 

As previously noted, method 25D provides a relative indicator of wastewater emission potential. While not a true
measure of VOC emissions, the volatile organic concentration of a wastewater stream does provide a relative means
of comparing the emission potential of a wastewater stream to other streams similarly managed and of comparing the
emission potential of a wastewater stream before and after treatment. 

Because the proposed rule regulates VOC emissions, the first choice for a test method is one that measures the concentration
of all VOC. However, this approach would require speciation test methods which are costly to use. As an alternative,
the EPA selected method 25D which does not speciate but measures total volatile organic concentration. This method,
which is much less costly, has been used in other wastewater related regulations. For example, method 25D is allowed
in the HON for measuring volatile organic concentration in applicability determinations. However, the HON does
not allow use of method 25D in calculations of mass removal for treatment processes. Instead, the HON uses a test method
that speciates HAPs for determining mass removal by treatment.

As currently structured, the proposed rule would make 
extensive use of the volatile organic concentration (as 
measured by Method 25D). The concentration cutoffs for 
determining if a wastewater stream is an affected stream are 
formatted in terms of the volatile organic concentration. 
The small quantity cutoff of 1 Mg/yr is calculated using the 
volatile organic concentration; the effluent concentration 
limit is expressed in term of volatile organic 
concentration; and the mass removal requirements of the 
proposed rule are calculated using the volatile organic 
concentration. The EPA is aware that using the volatile 
organic concentration rather than a direct measure of VOC 
does have some limitations and drawbacks. The test method 
used to measure volatile organic concentration, Method 25D, 
is based on volatility (i.e., Henry's Law) and does not 
speciate organic compounds. Therefore, the results may 
reflect the presence of compounds that are not considered 
VOC (based on their photochemical reactivity). The EPA is 
considering ways of discounting the non-VOC components of 
the test results but has not included a means to do so in 
the proposed regulation. One option for accomplishing this 
would be to allow owners or operators the option of using a 
test method that speciates VOC. If this approach is 
selected, provisions could also be made to allow the 
measured VOC concentration to be adjusted to represent VO 
concentration by multiplying by the fraction emitted (f

m

) 
values reported in the IWW CTG. The EPA also intends to 
include an alternative percent reduction standard based on 
the stripability of specific volatile organic constituents. 
This approach is also described in the IWW CTG. Because of 
the issues associated with the use of method 25D for 
applicability and compliance determinations, the EPA is 
soliciting comments all aspects of this approach. 


Regulatory Alternative 1 is to require emission control 
only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a 
volatile organic concentration at the point of wastewater 
generation equal to or greater than 1,000 ppmw and a flow 
rate greater than or equal to 10 Lpm. Regulatory 
Alternative 2 is to require emission control only of those 
SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a volatile 
organic concentration at the point of wastewater generation 
equal to or greater than 800 ppmw and a flow rate greater 
than or equal to 5 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 3 is to 
require emission control only of those SOCMI process unit 
wastewater streams having a volatile organic concentration 
at the point of wastewater generation equal to or greater 
than 500 ppmw and a flow rate greater than or equal to 
1 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 4 is to require emission 
control only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams 
having a volatile organic concentration at the point of 
wastewater generation equal to or greater than 100 ppmw and 
a flow rate greater than or equal to 1 Lpm. Regulatory 
Alternatives 1 through 4 also have a maximum volatile 
organic concentration limit whereby any wastewater stream 
with a volatile organic concentration above the limit would 
require emission control regardless of the wastewater stream 
flow rate; for Regulatory Alternatives 1 through 4, the same 
maximum concentration limit of 10,000 ppmw was used in the 
regulatory alternatives analysis. Regulatory Alternative 5 
is to require air emission control for all SOCMI process 
unit wastewater streams with any detectable volatile organic 
concentration as determined at the point of wastewater 
generation (i.e., a volatile organic concentration action 
level of 0 ppmw). 


The EPA estimated nationwide VOC emission reductions 
that would be achieved by implementing air rules based on 
each of the five regulatory alternatives; the EPA also 
estimated the capital and annual cost of achieving the 
emission reductions and the nonair quality environmental and 
energy impacts associated with each regulatory alternative. 
These estimates of emissions and costs reflect the annual 
impacts in the fifth year following promulgation of the 
NSPS. The methodology used to develop estimates of VOC 
emissions and other impacts within the SOCMI source category 
for the five regulatory alternatives is based on the use of 
a model plant analysis and is discussed in detail in 
Chapter 6 of the BID and in docket number A-94-32. 


Model plants are typically defined to represent the 
affected facility over a range of sizes corresponding to the 
range found in the regulated industry. Two previous EPA 
studies developed model plants that relate to emissions from 
wastewater streams at SOCMI facilities: the Guideline 
Series Document for the Control of Volatile Organic Compound 
Emissions from Industrial Wastewater (EPA-453/D-93-056, 
September 1992 Draft) and the BID related to the development 
of the HON (EPA-453/D-92-016, November 1992). The EPA 
developed model plants for the SOCMI wastewater NSPS 
regulatory analysis by making use of information, data, and 
methodologies developed in these previous studies.

In the absence of implementing any of the regulatory 
alternatives (baseline), nationwide, fifth-year wastewater 
VOC emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI 
process units are estimated to be approximately 37.2 
thousand Mg/yr. Assuming implementation of the individual 
regulatory alternatives, the emissions are 24.1 thousand 
Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, an emission reduction 
from baseline of 13.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total 
annual cost of about $4.3 million; 23.1 thousand Mg/yr for 
Regulatory Alternative 2, an emission reduction from 
baseline of 14.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
cost of about $5.2 million; 21.0 thousand Mg/yr for 
Regulatory Alternative 3, an emission reduction from 
baseline of 16.2 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
cost of about $8.8 million; 18.6 thousand Mg/yr for 
Regulatory Alternative 4, an emission reduction from 
baseline of 18.6 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
cost of about $15.6 million; and 14.2 thousand Mg/yr for 
Regulatory Alternative 5, an emission reduction from 
baseline of 22.9 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
cost of about $41.1 million. 


The control costs reflect the fact that most plants 
affected by the NSPS will also be affected by the HON, and 
they are expected to install a steam stripper for treating 
wastewater streams regulated by the HON. The proposed NSPS 
will require these SOCMI plants to control additional 
wastewater streams that do not require control under the 
HON. In estimating cost impacts of the NSPS, the EPA 
assumed that those plants affected by both regulations would 
increase the capacity of the steam stripper required under 
the HON rule to provide sufficient capacity to handle the 
additional wastewater streams that would require control 
under the NSPS. The costs associated with the NSPS is the 
difference in costs for the two steam strippers, one with 
the capacity to handle wastewater streams regulated by the 
HON and the other with the capacity to handle wastewater 
streams regulated by both the HON and the NSPS. 


After considering the alternatives and the emission 
reductions achieved, the resulting control costs, and other 
associated impacts, the EPA concluded that the control 
requirements in Regulatory Alternative 3 reflect the 
application of the best system of emission reduction that 
has been adequately demonstrated. 


A more stringent level of emissions limitation was not 
selected because control beyond Regulatory Alternative 3 
would result in costs that are disproportionately large 
compared to the additional emission reduction achieved. 
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were estimated to achieve an 
additional emission reduction of about 2.4 thousand and 6.7 
thousand Mg/yr, respectively, at an additional cost of about 
$6.8 million or $32.3 million for the two alternatives. 


Under the proposed rule, the control requirements for 
new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units would 
apply to two sets of wastewater streams: streams with flow 
rates of 1 Lpm or greater and a volatile organic 
concentration of 500 ppmw or greater; and any stream with a 
volatile organic concentration of 10,000 ppmw or greater 
(regardless of flow rate). 




2. Process Wastewater Collection System 




As discussed previously, effective control of SOCMI 
process unit wastewater emissions requires control from the 
point of generation until treated to comply with the 
treatment standards, or until recycled to a controlled 
process unit that is in compliance with the standards. The 
proposed standards require that emissions be controlled 
during wastewater collection and transport in piping or 
individual drain systems and during handling and treatment 
in wastewater tanks, containers, surface impoundments, and 
treatment devices by using covers, lids, water seals, roofs, 
and enclosures designed to reduce emissions. Proper work 
practices, including periodic monitoring, inspection, and 
repair, are also required to ensure that the equipment will 
control emissions. Emissions from these wastewater 
collection, transport, and handling systems are believed to 
be significant, thereby requiring the use of controls to 
effectively reduce air emissions. 




3. Process Wastewater Treatment 




The proposed regulation provides four options for 
demonstrating compliance with the SOCMI process unit 
wastewater treatment standards: three treatment options 
based on numerical emission limitations and an equipment and 
design specification. Of the options based on numerical 
emission limitations, the first option may be adopted by all 
affected sources. The remaining options based on numerical 
emission limitations may only be used by certain classes of 
sources, as discussed below. Any facility may choose to use 
the equipment and design specification as an alternative to 
the emission limitation requirements. 


The first treatment process compliance option is 
removal of VOC from the wastewater based on the removal 
efficiency of the BDT, which is a design steam stripper 
(i.e., a steam stripper meeting specific design and 
operational criteria). Under this equipment and design 
standard option for demonstrating compliance with the 
process wastewater treatment standard, if the owner or 
operator installs and operates a steam stripper that meets 
the requirements, listed below, the treatment unit is in 
compliance with the treatment process standard of the rule. 
These design and operating parameters include: 


(1) Minimum active column height of 5 meters; 


(2) Countercurrent flow configuration with a minimum 
of 10 actual trays; 


(3) Minimum steam flow rate of 0.04 kilograms of steam 
per liter of wastewater feed; 


(4) Minimum wastewater feed temperature to the steam 
stripper of 95 degrees Centigrade; 


(5) Maximum liquid loading of 67,100 liters per hour 
per square meter; and

<PARENT> FR940912-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(6) Minimum steam quality of 2,765 kilojoules per kilogram. 

The first of three additional treatment process compliance options that are formatted as a numerical emission limitations
is a requirement for 99-percent removal of volatile organic mass from the wastewater. The 99-percent removal may
be achieved through use of steam stripping on other control technologies. For example, another way to achieve the
99-percent removal is through air stripping. 

A second treatment process compliance option that is provided for demonstrating compliance is to treat the wastewater
stream to achieve a volatile organic concentration of 50 ppmw provided the owner or operator demonstrate a volatile
organic mass removal of 95 percent or greater. This treatment option is provided to allow additional flexibility
for the owner in demonstrating compliance with the wastewater treatment standard; treatment of wastewater streams
to a concentration of less than 50 ppmw generates a wastewater stream that would require no additional control from
the point at which it exits the treatment unit. This option is limited in its applicability for the reasons discussed
in Section IV.F.3. The 50 ppmw limit was selected based on analysis characterizing the volatile organic concentration
of wastewater streams in the SOCMI database that would be subject to the proposed standards both before and after treatment.
The limit is the minimum concentration that characterizes the volatile organic level of SOCMI wastewater streams
treated to comply with the proposed standards using the BDT steam stripper. 

The third numerical emission limitation option for demonstrating compliance is to remove a calculated mass of VOC
from a wastewater stream where the mass of VOC to be removed is calculated on the basis of the annual average wastewater
density and flow rate and the volatile organic average concentration in the wastewater stream. This option is designed
to accommodate the control of combined streams for the reasons discussed in section IV.F.3. The proposed rule also
provides an alternative treatment process compliance option for biological treatment units; under the alternative,
an owner or operator must treat affected wastewater streams in a biological treatment unit that destroys at least
95 percent of the organics. The EPA is allowing a 95-percent destruction efficiency for biological treatment units
as a compliance alternative for the treatment process standards in part because the Agency believes the use of these
units will have the effect of increasing the overall mass reduction achieved under the rule. This results from the
fact that if affected wastewater streams are allowed to be managed in a biological treatment unit, then it is fully
expected that other non- affected wastewater streams would also be managed in these biological treatment units,
resulting in additional control achieved or streams that may not otherwise be controlled under the regulation. The
alternative for biotreatment units in this rule is also consistent with other regulations regarding wastewater
treatment, such as the biotreatment provisions of the HON. 



4. Vent Collection for Vapor Recovery or Destruction 



Volatile organic compounds are emitted from vents on enclosed or covered process wastewater collection and treatment
system devices such as individual drain systems and steam strippers. These emissions are required to be vented through
a closed-vent system meeting the requirements established in the rule. The closed-vent system must route these vapors
to a vapor recovery or destruction device achieving at least a 95-percent destruction or recovery. This limitation
is based on the average efficiency of a conventional VOC recovery devices. The option of meeting an equivalent standard
(achieving an outlet concentration of 20 ppm by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen or providing a minimum
residence time and temperature) for enclosed combustion devices is provided as well. 

Because biological treatment units destroy the VOC in the wastewater, a well-operated biological treatment unit
is not required to be covered and vented to vapor recovery and destruction. Instead, the proposed regulation requires
an owner or operator electing to use a biological treatment unit to meet the 95 percent control requirement by demonstrating
that 95 percent of the volatile organic entering the biological treatment unit is being destroyed and not emitted
to the atmosphere. 



H. Modification and Reconstruction Considerations 



Under the General Provisions for modification (40 CFR 60.14) and reconstruction (40 CFR 60.15), facilities that
are modified or reconstructed after the date of proposal of a standard are subject to the standard. An owner or operator
of an existing facility who is planning changes in the facility that could be considered modification or reconstruction
shall notify the appropriate EPA Regional Office 60 days prior to making the changes or commencing construction,
as applicable. The enforcement division of the appropriate EPA Regional Office will make the final determination
as to whether an existing facility is modified or reconstructed and, as a result, subject to the standards of performance
of an affected facility.

1. Modification 



Upon modification of any emission source, an existing facility becomes an affected facility and therefore, subject
to the standard. With certain exceptions, any physical or operational change to an existing process unit that would
increase the emission rate from that process unit of any pollutant covered by the standard would be considered a modification
within the meaning of section 111 of the Act. If a physical or operational change to an existing process unit would increase
VOC emissions from the process unit, the owner or operator either can take appropriate measures to offset the emission
increase within the process unit such that there is no overall net increase in emissions from the process unit as a result
of the physical or operational change, or allow the process unit to be classified as an affected facility under the
modification criteria and control the process unit to meet the requirements of the NSPS. 

Under the current regulations, an emission increase from one affected facility (i.e., process unit) may not be offset
with a similar emission decrease at another affected facility to avoid becoming subject to NSPS. In addition, all
emissions, not just the incremental increase in emissions, of the pollutants that have increased from the affected
facility must be in compliance with the applicable standards. 

Under the General Provisions to part 60, the following physical or operational changes are not considered to be modifications
even though emissions may increase as a result of the change (see  60.14(e)): 

1. Routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (e.g., lubrication of mechanical equipment; replacement of pumps,
motors, and piping; cleaning of equipment); 

2. An increase in production rate without a capital expenditure (as defined in  60.2); 

3. An increase in the hours of operation; 

4. Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to proposal of the standard, the existing facility was designed
to accommodate that alternative fuel or raw material; 

5. The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is to reduce air pollutants, except when an emission
control system is replaced by a system determined by the EPA to be less environmentally beneficial; and 

6. Relocation or change in ownership of the existing facility. 

The following discussion identifies some possible changes to process unit operations used in SOCMI that might be
considered modifications. The magnitude of the industry covered and the complexity of the manufacturing process
permit only a general discussion of these possible changes. Therefore, the list of potential modifications for process
units provided below is not inclusive. 

a. 

Feedstock, Catalyst, or Reactant Substitution. 

Feedstock, catalyst, or reactant substitution is dictated by economics and the level of availability of the feedstock,
catalyst, or reactant. Depending upon the specific process, changes in feedstock or catalyst may require substantial
capital investment to modify the process to accommodate the change. The magnitude of the capital investment may prohibit
feedstock or catalyst substitution for many chemicals. 

Many of the chemicals produced in the SOCMI can be manufactured from two or more different feedstocks. For example,
cyclohexane can be manufactured using either phenol or cyclohexanol as the feedstock. In most cases, however, feedstock
substitution would likely require both equipment and process changes. 

Substitution of reactants within the SOCMI process units is also a likely change that could constitute a modification.
For example, for many chemicals, the potential exists to substitute air for pure oxygen or a chemical oxidant as a reactant
or vice versa. Changing to an air oxidation process may be advantageous because: (1) Air is readily available; and
(2) expensive corrosion-resistant materials are not required compared to the use of chemical oxidants. However,
there may be major disadvantages in changing from an oxygen or chemical oxidation process to an air oxidation process,
including a substantial reduction in plant capacity, a large increase in the reactor-related process vent stream
flow rate (i.e., increased VOC emissions), and an altered product mix. The use of oxygen or air oxidation may be substituted
for chemical oxidation processes as well. Reactant substitutions of this type may increase process unit VOC emissions
to the atmosphere and, as a result, may constitute a modification (unless the fixed capital expenditure exceeds 50
percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility, in which case it would be considered
reconstruction).

b. 

Process Equipment Changes. 

Process equipment changes also may constitute modifications. Examples of potential modifications are replacing
a fixed-bed reactor with a fluidized-bed reactor, increasing the plant capacity by increasing the size of the reactor
or adding additional reactors, and changing the product recovery system (e.g., from an absorber to a condenser).
Such changes might be considered modifications because they can result in increased VOC emissions. Again, capital
expenditures may be a factor in determining whether the change is a modification or a reconstruction. 
c. 

Combinations. 

A combination of the changes described above could be chosen in any given situation with the decision based on the most
advantageous economics for the site-specific conditions. The combination of changes might be considered a modification
if they resulted in an increase in emissions. The most common combinations are plant expansions or simultaneous changes
in feedstock and catalyst as described earlier. 


2. Reconstruction 


An existing facility may become subject to NSPS if it is reconstructed. Reconstruction is defined in  60.15
as the replacement of the components of an existing facility to the extent that: (1) The fixed capital cost of the new
components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility; and (2) it
is technically and economically feasible for the facility to meet the applicable standards. Because the EPA considers
reconstructed facilities to constitute new construction rather than modification, reconstruction determinations
are made irrespective of changes in emission rates. If the facility is determined to be reconstructed, it must comply
with all of the provisions of the standards of performance applicable to that facility. 


I. Monitoring Requirements 


The proposed standards include requirements for continuous monitoring to ensure that owners suppress and capture
emissions from the process unit wastewater collection system, treat the wastewater to reduce the VOC concentration,
and convey emission from the wastewater collection and treatment to a control device as specified in the regulation.
The specific parameters that need to be monitored are discussed below. 
Enhanced monitoring is required for certain control device parameters to demonstrate compliance with the standards.
Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission
limits of the standard. 


1. Wastewater Collection 


The standards require monitoring to ensure that the wastewater collection system equipment, which includes tanks,
surface impoundments, containers, and drain systems, is operated with no detectable leaks. The standards require
owners or operators to monitor initially using Method 21 to demonstrate that the system has no detectable leaks according
to the procedures in the rule. The standards also include a requirement for semi-annual visual inspection of the wastewater
collection system to detect and repair any leaks in the individual drain system. 


2. Wastewater Treatment 


The proposed regulation requires each owner or operator using a steam stripper to comply with the design and equipment
standard specified for wastewater treatment processes to install, calibrate, operate, and maintain according
to manufacturers' specifications continuous monitors with continuous recorders of: 
(1) The mass rate of wastewater fed to the stripper; 
(2) The mass rate of steam fed to the stripper; and 
(3) The wastewater column feed temperature. 
These parameters are either established during an initial performance test or according to design specification
in the regulation. They are typically monitored in the industry to ensure proper operation; therefore, ensuring
continuous compliance of a steam stripper with the specified requirements for VOC removal requires no additional
monitoring burden. 
Owners or operators using a biological treatment unit to achieve a 95-percent total VOC reduction across the unit
are required to measure the volatile organic concentration in the influent and effluent on a monthly basis and identify
appropriate parameters to be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. These parameters must be determined during
the initial performance test as demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, and monitored accordingly.



3. Enclosure and Closed-vent System Monitoring Requirements 


The proposed rule establishes requirements to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on enclosures and that
emissions are routed through a closed-vent system with no detectable leaks. If the closed-vent system contains bypass
lines, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to ensure emissions are not bypassing the control device.

An initial performance test must be conducted to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on all openings of each
enclosure, and a monthly inspection must be performed to confirm that any enclosure openings that were closed during
the performance test remain closed. 
To ensure continuous compliance with the requirement of no detectable leaks from the enclosure and closed-vent system,
monitoring with a portable hydrocarbon detector is required to be performed initially along with a program of annual
visible inspections of ductwork, piping, and connections to covers for evidence of visible defects. If visible defects
in the closed-vent system are observed, readings greater than 500 ppm by volume above background are measured, or
enclosure openings do not have negative pressure, a first effort to repair the closed-vent system must be made as soon
as practicable and no later than 5 calendar days after identification of the problem. The repair must be completed
no later than 15 calendar days after identification. 
To ensure the control device is not being bypassed if bypass lines are present, owners or operators must install, calibrate,
maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's instructions a flow indicator that provides a record of emission
point gas stream flow at least once every 15 minutes. As an alternative, the proposed rule allows bypass lines to be
sealed in the closed position and visually inspected to ensure they are being maintained in the closed position. The
use of flow indicators or seals on the bypass lines ensures that process vent streams are continuously being routed
to the control device. 


4. Control Device Monitoring 


The purpose of enhanced monitoring is to provide a means for major sources to demonstrate that the affected facility
is in continuous compliance with the standards. In light of these requirements, the EPA has considered how sources
subject to the NSPS would demonstrate continuous compliance with standards for SOCMI process unit wastewater.

The EPA considered three monitoring options for control devices: (1) the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS)
to measure total VOC; (2) the use of CEMS for surrogate compounds such as total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate for
total VOC; or (3) the continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters. 
The first two options were determined to be unreasonable for this industry as discussed below. Although continuous
emission monitors for total VOC are currently available, these devices are not universally applicable within this
source category. Current emission monitoring systems that measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection
(FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles
that respond to VOC levels. However, in most cases, VOC monitors provide only a measure of the relative concentration
level of a mixture of organics, rather than quantification of the organic species present. This trait necessitates
the use of VOC CEMS more as a relative indicator rather than as a conventional emission monitor. Cases where it is possible
to consider the VOC monitor as a conventional CEMS are, for the most part, limited to instances where only one organic
species is present or where equal incremental amounts of each of the organic species present generate equal instrument
responses. These instances are very unlikely to occur at SOCMI process units. 
In addition, a CEMS system that uses gas chromatography to measure gaseous organic compound emissions may not be suitable
for applications where the number of VOC compounds to be monitored exceeds five. (See proposed Performance Specifications
101 and 102, appendix A of 40 CFR part 64, October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648.) However, SOCMI wastewaters can be expected
routinely to have multiple chemical constituents with variable concentrations. Under these conditions, implementation
of a CEMS system would be a costly undertaking. Furthermore, parametric monitoring has been demonstrated to be an
effective means of indicating continuous compliance. Therefore, because a CEMS requirement would place an extra
burden on the industry without increasing the accuracy of compliance demonstrations, the first two options were
determined to be unreasonable. Owners or operators using control devices (e.g., incinerators or condensers) to
comply with the proposed standards may use CEMS where applicable to demonstrate continuous compliance. However,
parameter monitoring is also allowed if control devices are used. The Agency has selected temperature as the operating
parameter that would then be monitored to determine ongoing compliance with the standard. For example, owners or
operators of incinerators would have to monitor the combustion temperature (or the temperature before and after
the catalyst bed if a catalytic incinerator is used), and owners or operators of condensers would have to monitor the
temperature of the vapor exhaust stream. 
The use of CEMS on control devices is not proposed to be required for the following reasons: 
(1) CEMS cannot accurately determine compliance for many SOCMI wastewaters; 
(2) For each of these control systems a measurable control device parameter (e.g., temperature) is considered to
provide a suitable indication of performance for determining compliance; and 
(3) Temperature monitors are considerably less costly than CEMS. 
The proposed standards, therefore, would be based on parameter monitoring to demonstrate compliance with the standards
for control devices. The Agency is soliciting comments on the selection of temperature as a parameter to monitor for
compliance and any available data on the correlation of the control device parameter to the control efficiency. The
proposed rule would not preclude owners or operators who are using control devices to comply with the rule from choosing
to use CEMS to demonstrate compliance. 
The continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters, established during the performance test or specified
through design, is used to determine whether continuous compliance is achieved. Failure to maintain the established
values for these parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission limits of the proposed standards. Some
of the process parameters are already monitored as part of normal operation. Therefore, continuous compliance is
assured without imposing an additional unnecessary burden on the facility. 
In the proposed rule, enhanced monitoring is only applicable to control devices used to meet the requirements of the
regulation. However, the EPA fully intends to make this rule consistent with other enhanced monitoring requirements.
Therefore, the EPA is soliciting comments on the extent the enhanced monitoring requirements in the proposed rule
are sufficient to meet the overall requirements of the Agency with regard to enhanced monitoring under section 114(a)
of the CAAA or are additional requirements needed within the rule to meet the requirements of the CAAA. 


J. Performance Test Methods 


Test methods and procedures are required to ensure compliance with the proposed standards, which include requirements
for demonstrating that an emission point or process unit wastewater stream does not require control or that it is in
compliance with the control requirements. Requirements to test for no detectable leaks from control devices, enclosure
and closed-vent systems, and process wastewater collection and treatment systems are also included.

1. Wastewater Concentration and Flow Determination 


The standards require the use of approved test methods 
and procedures to ensure consistent and verifiable results 
for demonstration that a wastewater stream does not require 
control, or for demonstration that the allowed emission 
levels are achieved when controls are applied. Affected 
wastewater streams are subject to the standards if they meet 
either of the following conditions at the point of 
generation: 
(1) The average flow rate of the affected wastewater 
stream is 1.0 Lpm or greater and the mass-weighted average 
volatile organic concentration is 500 ppmw or greater; or 
(2) The mass-weighted average volatile organic 
concentration of the affected wastewater stream is 10,000 
ppmw or greater, regardless of the stream flow rate. 
Two important parameters must be quantified to 
determine whether an affected stream must be controlled. 
These parameters are the annual wastewater quantity for a 
stream and the volatile organic concentration of the stream 
at the point of generation. 
Several methods can be used to determine wastewater 
quantity. These methods include using knowledge about the 
capacity of the wastewater-generating process or the waste 
management unit, and using measurements that are 
representative of maximum annual wastewater generation 
rates. Knowledge-based methods are allowed to provide 
flexibility and to provide less expensive alternatives than 
actual annual measurement if the appropriate information is 
available. 
For quantifying the volatile organic concentration of 
the wastewater streams, three methods are available: 
(1) Knowledge of the wastewater streams; (2) bench scale or 
pilot scale test data; or (3) physical measurements of 
volatile organic concentration. These methods have been 
allowed to provide flexibility and to provide less expensive 
alternatives than actual measurement if the appropriate 
information is available. 
If the actual volatile organic concentration of the 
wastewater stream is determined through direct measurement, 
the regulation specifies that the procedures of Method 25D 
in appendix A of part 60, ``Determination of the Volatile 
Organic Concentration of Waste Samples,'' which provides a 
relative measure of the emissions potential of the stream, 
be used to analyze the sample. Alternatively, the sample 
may be analyzed to determine the volatile organic 
concentration using any test method or test data that has 
been validated according to the protocols in Method 301 in 
appendix A of part 63. As pointed out in section II of this 
document, there are several issues associated with the use 
of method 25D on which the EPA is soliciting comment. 
Flow rates may be determined using information about 
the maximum annual production capacity of the process unit, 
knowledge of the process, and mass balance information or by 
measuring the flow rate at the point of generation during 
conditions that are representative of average wastewater 
generation rates. 


2. Performance Tests 


The initial performance test requirements of 
section 60.8 of the part 60 General Provisions are not 
required for treatment processes or vent stream control 
devices. Instead, the proposed standards provide 
alternative means of compliance that the EPA considers 
equivalent to the direct measurement of emissions as 
required under  60.8 and less burdensome to the industry. 
The proposed rule includes treatment process 
performance test procedures for the effluent concentration, 
percent reduction, and required mass removal standards. 
These test procedures involve measurements of volatile 
organic concentrations using Method 25D or any other methods 
for which the results are validated using Method 301. 
Performance testing is to be conducted at representative 
inlet flow rates and at volatile organic concentrations 
under which it would be most difficult to determine 
compliance. 
For noncombustion treatment processes complying with 
the percent reduction requirement, the total volatile 
organic mass flow rate entering the treatment process and 
exiting the treatment process shall be determined by 
computing the product of the average flow rate of the 
wastewater stream entering or exiting the treatment process 
and the average total volatile organic concentration of the 
entering or exiting wastewater streams, respectively. The 
flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater streams 
shall be determined using the inlet and outlet flow meters, 
respectively. 
For combustion treatment processes complying with the 
percent reduction requirement, the total volatile organic 
mass flow rate entering the combustion unit shall be 
determined by computing the product of the average flow rate 
of the wastewater stream entering the combustion unit, as 
determined by the inlet flow meter, and the average total 
volatile organic concentration in the waste stream entering 
the combustion device. The volume exhausted shall be 
determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, as appropriate. The average total organic 
concentration in the exhaust downstream of the combustion 
unit shall be determined using Method 18 of appendix A of 
part 60, or any other test method validated according to the 
procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of part 63.

<DOCNO> FR940912-1-00045 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940912-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A performance test to demonstrate compliance of a vent 
stream control device with the organic compound reduction 
efficiency requirement shall use Method 1 or 1A of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, to select 
sampling sites. The mass flow rate of organics entering and 
exiting the control device shall be determined by using 
Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60, as 
appropriate, to determine the volume exhausted and by using 
Method 18 of appendix A of part 60, or any other test method 
validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of 
appendix A of part 63, to determine total organic 
concentration. 
A performance test to demonstrate compliance with the 
mass removal provision shall consist of a determination of 
mass removal required to be achieved and a determination of 
mass removal actually achieved. The total required mass 
removal is calculated by adding together the required mass 
removal for each individual affected stream to be combined 
for treatment. The required mass removal for each affected 
wastewater stream prior to combination of the streams for 
treatment shall be determined using the wastewater average 
flow rate and volatile organic average concentration at the 
point of generation for each affected wastewater stream to 
be combined for treatment. The actual total volatile 
organic mass removal in the wastewater stream shall be 
determined using the same procedures as described for 
noncombustion treatment processes complying with the percent 
reduction requirement. 
Finally, a performance test to demonstrate compliance 
of a biological treatment process with the 95-percent mass 
reduction requirement must be conducted using the procedures 
specified in the proposed rule. The control efficiency of 
the biological treatment unit is a function of the fraction 
biodegraded in a properly operated biological treatment 
unit. This fraction shall be determined using the 
procedures in appendix C of 40 CFR part 63. 
A performance test is not specified for the design 
steam stripper; installation of the specified equipment, 
along with monitoring to show attainment of the specified 
operating parameter levels, demonstrates compliance with the 
equipment design and operation provisions. 
Each vapor collection system, closed-vent system, fixed 
roof, cover, or enclosure must be evaluated initially and at 
annual intervals using Method 21 of appendix A of part 60 to 
determine the presence of detectable emissions from leaks. 
Method 21 represents the best available method for detecting 
leaks from these sources. 


K. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 


The reporting requirements necessitated by the proposed 
standard are authorized by section 114 of the Act. In 
addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
specified in the part 60 General Provisions, the proposed 
standard would require the submittal of several types of 
reports. First, the part 60 General Provisions would 
require notification reports, which inform the Agency of 
facilities subject to the NSPS. These reports include 
notification of construction, anticipated and actual startup 
dates, and physical or operational changes. In addition to 
the information required by the General Provisions, owners 
or operators would be required to provide information with 
the notice of construction identifying the process unit and 
stream as well as a brief description of the intended 
treatment and/or control technology. As part of the 
notification of startup, sources would also be required to 
provide more detailed information on the waste stream and 
waste management units. For example, sources would provide 
information on the chemical manufacturing processes that are 
subject to the proposed rule, information on the intended 
compliance strategy, and any required control device 
parameter ranges, unless the parameter ranges have already 
been established in the operating permit. 
Reports of the required design analysis (for steam 
strippers) or of performance test results of emission 
control systems would be required as well. These reports 
show whether a facility is initially meeting the level of 
the standard. The proposed rule would override the General 
Provisions requirements for quarterly reports for excess 
emissions and monitoring systems performance. Instead, 
semi-annual reports would be required in the event of each 
control equipment failure or instance when monitored 
parameters are not within their established values. Each 
semi-annual report shall include the date of the inspection, 
identification of each waste management unit in which a 
control equipment failure was detected, description of the 
failure, and description of the nature of and date the 
repair was made. The semi-annual report shall also contain 
information on monitoring results that exceed the boundaries 
established in the operating permit.

Owners or operators are required to keep records of all 
reports submitted under the proposed rule, of all monitoring 
parameters, equipment inspections, and of the determination 
of volatile organic concentration and/or annual average flow 
rate using knowledge of the process. Records must be 
maintained for 5 years. 


L. Solicitation of Comments 


The EPA seeks full public participation in arriving at 
its final decisions, and strongly encourages comments on all 
aspects of this proposal from all interested parties. 
Whenever applicable, full supporting data and detailed 
analysis should be submitted to allow the EPA to make 
maximum use of the comments. The Agency invites all parties 
to coordinate their data collection activities with the EPA 
to facilitate mutually beneficial and cost-effective data 
submissions. The EPA is interested in participating in 
study plans, data collection, and documentation. Please 
refer to the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

 section at the 
beginning of this preamble for technical contacts at the 
EPA. All comments should be directed to the EPA Air Docket, 
Docket No. A-94-32 (see 

ADDRESSES

). Comments on this notice 
will be accepted to the date specified in 

DATES.

 
In addition, the EPA particularly requests comments and 
data on the following issues: 
1. The proposed approach to reducing the burden on 
owners or operators of waste management units, treatment 
processes, or control devices that allows owners or 
operators to comply with the control requirements of the 
proposed SOCMI NSPS for these waste management units, 
treatment processes, or control devices by demonstrating 
compliance with the benzene waste operations NESHAP, the 
HON, or the RCRA air emission standards for hazardous waste 
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; 
2. The EPA's proposed approach to identifying 
parameters that define process unit wastewater streams that 
do not require control, whether it is feasible to identify 
such streams in ways other than through concentration or 
flow rate cutoffs, and information for defining such 
streams; 
3. The selection of temperature as a control device 
parameter to monitor to demonstrate compliance with the 
control device standards, and the correlation between 
temperature and the control efficiency, especially for 
regenerable activated carbon adsorption systems; and 
4. The inclusion of maintenance wastewater as part of 
the scope of the proposed standards and any barriers to the 
control of maintenance wastewater streams that meet the 
concentration and flow criteria used to identify those 
streams that require control at new facilities. 
5. The accessibility of SOCMI monitoring data and 
periodic reports to the general public as required by 
section 114(c) of the CAAA. 
6. The extent the enhanced monitoring requirements in 
the proposed rule are sufficient to meet the general 
requirements of the EPA for enhanced monitoring. 
7. The appropriateness of using method 25D and the 
resulting volatile organic concentration in the 
applicability and compliance determinations within the 
structure of the proposed regulation without discounting the 
non-VOC portion of the volatile organic concentration and 
also without eliminating low volatility compounds from test 
results. 
8. The relevance of including in the NSPS an 
alternative percent reduction compliance option for 
treatment processes that is based on the fraction removed by 
the design steam stripper for the individually speciated 
VOC. 
Commenters wishing to submit proprietary information 
for consideration should clearly distinguish such 
information from other comments, and clearly label it 
``Confidential Business Information.'' Submissions containing 
such proprietary information should be sent directly to the 
contact person listed above, and not to the public docket. 
Information covered by such a claim of confidentiality will 
be disclosed by the EPA only to the extent allowed and by 
the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. If no claim of 
confidentiality accompanies the submission when it is 
received by the EPA, it may be made available to the public 
without further notice to the commenter.

V. Administrative Requirements 


A. Public Hearing 


A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss 
the proposed rule in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of 
the Act. Persons wishing to make an oral presentation on 
the proposed NSPS for SOCMI Wastewater should contact the 
EPA (see 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

). Oral 
presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any 
member of the public may file a written statement before, 
during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written 
statements should be addressed to the Air Docket Section 
(see 

ADDRESSES

), and should refer to Docket No. A-94-32. A 
verbatim transcript of the hearing and any written 
statements will be available for public inspection and 
copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air Docket 
Section (see 

ADDRESSES

). 


B. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 
1993), the EPA must determine whether a regulation is 
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the 
Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory 
action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious 
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the 
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
This action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes 
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are 
documented in the public record. 


C. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), federal agencies are required 
to assess the economic impact of federal regulations on 
small entities. The Act specifically requires the 
completion of a Regulatory flexibility Analysis in those 
instances where small business impacts are possible. 
Because the impact of the proposed rule on all entities is 
likely to be insignificant in terms of changes in industry 
output, changes in expansion plans, and employment loss, it 
is reasonable to conclude that small entities, regardless of 
their number, are not significantly affected. Therefore, 
because these standards impose no adverse economic impacts, 
a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been conducted. 
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby 
certify that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 


D. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements for this 
proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 

Paperwork Reduction 
Act

, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. An Information Collection 
Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR 
No. 1697.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, 
Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, 
or by calling (202) 260-2740. 
The public recordkeeping and reporting annual burden 
for this collection of information is estimated to average 
13 hours per response for reporting and 203 hours per 
respondent for recordkeeping. These estimates include time 
for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, 
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing 
and reviewing the collection of information. 
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information 
Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
401 M Street, SW.; Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management 
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk 
Officer for EPA.'' Responses to any OMB or public comments 
on the information collection requirements contained in this 
proposal will accompany the final rule.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule governs the collection and disposition of revenues generated by incidental use of Reclamation
projects or project lands. It is being promulgated so that the water districts have access to the legal requirements
that Reclamation applies in crediting revenues to the district.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background


The 1902 passage of the Reclamation Act, (43 U.S.C. 391, 

et seq.

) provided for the creation of the Reclamation fund (a fund within the U.S. Treasury) to be used to finance water projects
in the arid west. These water projects were to be constructed on a reimbursable basis with the water users repaying
the funds advanced from the Reclamation fund, without interest. 
The early Reclamation projects were for irrigation only, and the irrigators were responsible for the repayment of
all costs associated with these projects. Intending to recover the costs of construction projects as quickly as possible,
Congress set the time frame for the repayment of funds by the water users in this initial period at 10 years. This responsibility,
and the original repayment time frame of 10 years, proved to be a difficult and significant burden on the water users.
In 1914, this term was extended to 20 years by Section 2 of the Reclamation Extension Act of August 13, 1914 (43 U.S.C.
475). 
Originally, the funds that made up the Reclamation fund were from revenues generated by the sale of public lands (see
Section 1 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.) It soon became apparent that this source of revenue was not sufficient to
cover the costs of constructing water projects. This was addressed in a variety of statutes, one of which was the Sundry
Civil Expenses Appropriations Act for 1920 (43 U.S.C. 394). This act forms the basis for the allocation of lease revenues
by requiring that revenues generated from the leasing of withdrawn Reclamation lands would be a credit to the Reclamation
fund. 
The 1920's saw the agriculture industry experiencing serious economic difficulties that further affected the water
users' ability to meet their contractual obligations to the United States. Responding to these difficulties, Congress
enacted the Fact Finders Act of 1924. Section 4, Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act created an entitlement program
that allowed the direct crediting of certain revenues to the water users. Providing the water users assumed responsibility
for the operation and maintenance of the project, the revenues from certain activities conducted on Federal lands
would be used toward relieving the water users of their yearly payment on the construction costs. The revenues were
restricted to those from project power plants, leasing of project lands for grazing and farms, and the sale or use of
townsite lots. These revenues were to be applied as a direct or front-end credit: (1) To the water users' annual construction
charges; (2) to their annual project operation and maintenance expenses; and (3) as directed by the water users (43
U.S.C. 501). Revenues were required to be credited to construction costs until all obligations to the United States
have been repaid. 
Additional relief was provided when the Congress approved The Omnibus Adjustment Act of May 25, 1926, that allowed
the Secretary to extend the crediting provisions of Subsection I to water districts in identified projects without
requiring them to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the project. Section 45 of the Omnibus Adjustment
Act also allowed the Secretary of the Interior to amend existing water-rights contracts, at the request of the water
district, to extend the repayment period to 40 years (43 U.S.C. 423d). 
The Congress did not, in its enactment of Subsection I, repeal prior revenue specific statutes, nor did it indicate
that the revenue disposition requirements reflected in Subsection I would extend to revenues derived from sources
not identified. For example, the revenue disposition requirements of the Act for the Sale of Surplus Acquired Lands
of February 2, 1911, provided for the revenues from the sale of such lands to be a ``credit to the project'' 
rather than a credit to the water users (43 U.S.C. 374).

Subsection J of the Fact Finders Act (43 U.S.C. 526) also required the revenues generated by the sale of surplus water
under the Warren Act (43 U.S.C. 523) to be deposited as a credit to the project. Therefore, the disposition requirements
of Subsection I were restricted to the revenues generated from the uses specified in that subsection. 
On May 9, 1938, Congress, with the passage of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment to the Interior Department Appropriation
Act of 1939, altered revenue crediting requirements by providing that all of the revenues generated in connection
with any irrigation project, including the incidental power features, would thereafter be a credit to the Reclamation
fund. This provision excepted those cases in which law or existing contract provisions provided for a different use
of these revenues, such as reflected in the passage of legislation authorizing the establishment of special accounts,
specific revenue crediting directions, and/or revolving funds that govern the management of revenues from specific
projects. Additionally, the provision provided that when construction costs of the project that were allocated
to power had been repaid and the revenues from the sale of power were no longer required to meet contractual obligations
to the United States, the net revenues from the sale of power would be credited to the Treasury of the United States as
miscellaneous receipts. 
Thus, the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment protected existing contracts with valid direct revenue crediting provisions,
but removed the opportunity for future Subsection I application. The sources of the revenues covered by the Hayden-O'Mahoney
Amendment are all inclusive as indicated by the language of the provision (43 U.S.C. 392a). 
It should be noted that during the years that the Fact Finders Act provisions were available, Reclamation projects
started to become multi-purpose in scope. Due to this evolution from single purpose (irrigation) to multi-purpose
(municipal and industrial, irrigation, power, flood control, etc.), the focus of project repayment no longer rested
entirely with the irrigators. The repayment of project construction was now allocated among the various water users;
municipal and industrial users and power facilities, as well as the irrigators. To further disperse the repayment
responsibilities, Congress deemed certain purposes, such as flood control, to be in the public's best interest and
as such made them nonreimbursable by the project beneficiaries. 
The passage of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 provided the next major impact on the repayment of Reclamation projects.
Specifically, Sections 9 (c), (d)(3) and (e) introduced: (1) The 40-year repayment schedule as standard rather than
on the ``as requested'' basis of the 1926 Act; and (2) the concept of ``ability to pay'' (43 U.S.C. 485). 
The concept of ``ability to pay'' allowed the revenues generated from approved project purposes, such as power, to
be used to help repay the portion of the construction cost allocated to irrigation. This plan is implemented by assessing
the financial resources of the water users and assigning to them responsibility to repay that portion of the construction
costs allocated to irrigation on the basis of their ability to pay. The remainder of the construction cost allocated
to irrigation was assigned to other project users. In this way the legal requirement for a full return of the project
costs would be met. For example, power revenues in excess of the amount needed to repay the power component of project
construction may be used to make up the difference between the amount the irrigators were able to pay and the costs allocated
to the irrigation purpose. 
By introducing ``ability to pay'' Congress provided assistance to the irrigators that did not involve using revenues
derived from Federal lands as a direct credit to the water users. Thus, while the direct crediting aspects of Subsection
I of the Fact Finders Act of 1924 were removed by the enactment of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment of the Interior Department
Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 1939, which directed that all revenues would be a credit to the Reclamation fund,
Congress did not abandon the needs of the irrigators. Indeed, the water users benefitted from the introduction of
the concept of ``ability to pay'' in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.

There are many statutes that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into specific agreements for the incidental
use of Reclamation projects and project lands. These activities may take place on both withdrawn public domain lands
and on lands acquired for Reclamation projects either by purchase, exchange, or condemnation. In addition, activities
may be authorized for the use of project facilities or may address the sale or disposal of water. Generally those statutes
detailed the specific manner in which revenues generated by these incidental uses were to be distributed. The revenues
are funds of the United States and, as required by the U. S. Constitution, cannot be expended or credited other than
as Congress directs. In those instances where Congress has not provided specific crediting criteria, Reclamation
has adopted the manner of revenues crediting specified for other activities from authorized use of Reclamation lands.
Examples of the types of uses on Reclamation projects and project lands include: 
(1) 

Leasing of minerals_

The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, (30 U.S.C. 181, et seq.), and the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands
of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 351, 
et seq.), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to engage in the leasing and extraction of minerals, i.e., oil,
gas, oil shale, gilsonite, sodium, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, and asphalt either on lands (specifically the
mineral estates) in the public domain, or on lands acquired for a specific project and administered by Reclamation.
(Jurisdiction over leasing activities does not rest with Reclamation). 
(2) 

Mineral leases (geothermal steam)_

The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1001, et seq.) authorized the United States to issue leases for geothermal
steam on both public domain and on acquired Federal lands. (Jurisdiction over leasing activities does not rest with
Reclamation). 
(3) 

Recreation/concession agreements_

The Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 88-578); the Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965
(Pub. L. 89-72), as amended by the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 94-251); and the Reclamation
Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Title 28, Pub. L. 102-575), provide for the charging and
collection of fees for public recreational uses of the land and water under the jurisdiction of Reclamation. 
(4) 

Sale of products and rights-of-use_

Section 10 of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 387) grants authority to the Secretary of the Interior
to permit the removal of sand, gravel, and certain other types of mineral materials and building materials, including
the sale of timber, and to grant leases, licenses, easements, and rights-of-way on lands either withdrawn or acquired
by the Government. This authority was valid only so long as the granting of the rights-of-use was not incompatible
with the purposes for which the lands were designated. 
(5) 

Rights-of-way authorized by Mineral Leasing Act of 1920_The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920

 (30 U.S.C. 181, 
et seq.) authorized the granting of rights-of-way for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid or
gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced to a common collection point, a refiner, or to the point of sale.

(6) 

Sale of townsites_

The Townsites and Power Development Act of April 16, 1906 (43 U.S.C. 561) authorized the withdrawal of lands from public
entry to be used for the purpose of townsite lots in conjunction with irrigation projects (up to 160 acres). The lands
were then surveyed, subdivided and sold by Reclamation for townsite lots (43 U.S.C. 562). 
(7) 

Sale of land_

The Bureau of Reclamation has authority to sell land that is under its jurisdiction in several different statutes:

(a) The Sale of Surplus Acquired Lands Act of February 2, 1911 (43 U.S.C. 374) authorizes the sale of lands acquired
under the provisions of the Reclamation Act that are no longer needed for the purpose for which the lands were acquired.

(b) The Sale of Surplus Improved Public Lands Act of May 20, 1920 (43 U.S.C. 375) authorizes the sale of withdrawn public
domain lands that were improved at the expense of the project for which the lands were withdrawn. 
(c) The Disposal of Small Tracts Act of March 31, 1950 (43 U.S.C. 375b) authorizes the sale of public domain lands withdrawn
for the construction of a Reclamation project that are in tracts too small to qualify as farm units. 


B. Methods of Disbursement 


Revenues disposition statutes governing Reclamation projects generally cover four primary methods of crediting.
These methods are: (1) Front-end or direct credit; (2) credit to the project or tail-end credit; (3) general credit
to the Reclamation fund; and (4) general credit to revolving funds or special accounts authorized by Congress. 
(1) Revenues that are to be credited as a direct or front-end credit are credited to the reimbursable construction
costs of the project by satisfying all or part of the annual payment currently due from the water users. All revenues
in excess of the annual construction payment are to be applied against the annual operation and maintenance expenses
of the district. This relieves the water users of their current repayment obligation, in part or in its entirety, without
accelerating the repayment of the total construction debt. Section 4, Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act is the only
general statute with applicability at more than one Reclamation project in which front-end crediting provisions
are found. These provisions were conditioned on whether the district had assumed the operation and maintenance of
the project, or the Secretary of the Interior had granted this relief under the authority of the Omnibus Adjustment
Act of May 25, 1926. Subsection I allowed the revenues derived from the sale of project power, the sale or use of townsite
lots, and the leasing of Federal lands for the purposes of grazing and agriculture to be credited as a direct or front-end
credit. 
(2) Credits to the project or tail-end credits involve funds being directed to the Reclamation fund and applied to
the construction obligation of the project associated with the revenues. This method of repayment accelerates the
return of the construction cost of the project to the Reclamation fund. 
(3) General credit to the Reclamation fund does not provide a benefit to either the project construction costs or to
the districts' annual obligations. When revenues are a credit to the Reclamation fund, the funds are not targeted
to be spent on a specific function or project, but are only available to be spent as directed by the laws that control
the fund. 
(4) General credit to special accounts or revolving funds are created by Congressional authorization and relate
to specific projects or specialized activities. These accounts/revolving funds are maintained separate and apart
from the Reclamation fund and are managed in accordance with the legislation that authorized their creation. Project-specific
special accounts or revolving funds are: (a) The Recreation Account within the general fund of the Treasury was created
by the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1987. This account is a depository for recreation user fees or concession fees; (b)
The Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund is specific to the Central Arizona Project and was established under
the authority of Section 403 of the Colorado River Basin Project Act of September 10, 1968; (c) The Columbia Basin Land
Development Account was authorized under Section 6 of the Columbia Basin Project Act of March 10, 1943, and is specific
to the Columbia Basin Project; (d) The Colorado River Dam Fund was authorized under the authority of Section 2 of the
Boulder Canyon Project Act of December 21, 1928, and is specific to the Boulder Canyon Project; and (e) The Upper Colorado
River Basin Fund was established under the authority of Section 5 of the Colorado River Storage Project Act of April
11, 1956, and is specific to the divisions of the Colorado River Storage Project.

C. Immediate Action



The Office of the Inspector General (IG) conducted an audit of Reclamation's revenues crediting practices and made
recommendations for ensuring proper application of revenues received from the use of water project facilities and
lands. That office also recommended, in part, that inappropriate revenues crediting be discontinued. Reclamation
is currently in the process of implementing the recommendations. A review of repayment contracts and amendments,
and current Reclamation practices as they pertain to collection and crediting or disposition of those revenues,
has been accomplished. These rules are being published to establish guidance for the consistent application of revenues
received.





Public Comment on Rules





Reclamation received a total of 10 comments in response to its notice of intent to propose rulemaking that was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 3, 1994. Four of the responses received were requests for copies of future rulemaking actions; two were
requests for more information about revenues crediting after a district has fulfilled its repayment obligation
to the Government; four responses contained comments specific to different methods of crediting. All of the comments
received have been reviewed and have been or will be addressed in either this proposed rule or in future rulemaking
actions.

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written suggestions or objections regarding
the proposed rule to the location identified in the Addresses section of this preamble. Comments must be received
on or before November 14, 1994.




Executive Order 12866





This rule is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.





Paperwork Reduction Act





This proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.





National Environmental Policy Act Compliance





The Department of the Interior has determined that this action meets the criteria for an action categorically excluded
from the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1508.4) under Departmental Manual part 516 DM
6, Appendix 9, section 9.4.A.1_``Changes in regulations or policy directives and legislative proposals where impacts
are limited to economic and/or social effects.''





Small Entity Flexibility Analysis





This proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed
rule establishes procedures for the management of revenues from activities on Reclamation projects and project
lands.



Authorship



This proposed rule was prepared by the Reclamation Law, Contracts, and Repayment Office, Bureau of Reclamation,
Denver, Colorado.

Concession

 refers to any non-Federal entity operating on Reclamation lands that is remunerated by visitors for use of facilities,
goods, and/or services that it provides for their recreational purposes, general enjoyment, and/or needs. 


Concession fee

 refers to compensation received by the managing agency from a concession as defined under ``concession'' above.



Credit to the project or tail-end credit

 refers to the disposition of revenues to the Reclamation fund as a credit to the project construction costs. This method
accelerates the return of construction costs to the Reclamation fund. 


Direct or front-end credit

help satisfy their next capital obligation to the Government, for annual project operation and maintenance expenses,
or as the district directs. 


Easement

 refers to a grant of an interest to a party in the land of another for a specific use of specified land. Easements usually
consist of long-term rights-of-way for public roads, telecommunication lines, transmission lines, and pipelines.



General credit

 refers to those revenues credited to the Reclamation fund without benefit to the water users, the districts, or the
project construction costs. 


Grazing

 means a lease granted by the Government that entitles the lessee to use project lands for the purpose of grazing livestock.
Grazing lands refers to lands currently under lease for that purpose. 


Lease

 means a contract by which the lessor (Government) gives to another (tenant or lessee), the use or possession of land,
facilities, or water for a specific purpose for a specified period of time, in exchange for agreed upon payments. 


License or permit

 refers to a grant of authority for a person or entity to use a specific piece of land for a specific purpose without gaining
any interest in the land. A license or permit may allow use for: the construction and placement of small transmission
lines; temporary access roads; trails; small pipelines; small power lines; removal of timber, sand and gravel, and
other building material; miscellaneous agricultural uses; cabin sites; and like activities. A permit or license
is used when Reclamation does not intend to grant control of the surrounding area, as is the case with an easement or
lease. 


Mineral materials

 includes, but is not limited to, common varieties of sand, stone, gravel, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay, and petrified
wood. 


Project

 means any Reclamation irrigation or multi-purpose project, including incidental features thereof, authorized
by Federal Reclamation law, or constructed by the United States pursuant to such a law, or in connection with which
there is a repayment or water service contract executed by the United States pursuant to such law, or any project constructed
by the Secretary of the Interior through Reclamation. 


Public domain lands

 refers to lands that have never left Federal ownership. 


Reclamation fund

 means a special fund within the Treasury, established by the Congress under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, as
amended and supplemented. Monies from the fund are available for the investigation, construction, operation, and
administration of Reclamation projects. Collections from water users for reimbursable costs of these projects
are returned to the fund unless Congress has specified otherwise. 


Revenues

 refers to monies generated from the use of lands. This excludes administrative fees, annual obligations paid in accordance
with repayment contracts and water service contracts, monies generated from the marketing of surplus power, and
revenues from the sale or rental of surplus water or storage and conveyance capacity. 


Right-of-use

 refers to legal temporary uses of project lands resulting from easements, permits, licenses, leases, and rights-of-way.



Right-of-way

 refers to a legal right of passage over another's land, such as for roads and transmission lines. 


Special use permit

 refers to a permit issued with or without charge to a group for activities such as the rental of picnic shelters, off-road
vehicle access, river running excursions, etc.

to contract with the Secretary of the Interior for water. This definition includes entities that contract for construction
or improvement of water storage and/or delivery facilities. 


Withdrawn lands

 refers to those lands withdrawn from public entry and set aside for a specific public purpose or program, and contributed
at no cost to the project by the United States. 


 403.40 

Decisions and appeals. 


(a) Unless otherwise provided by the Secretary of the Interior, the regional director shall make any determination
required under these rules and regulations. 
(1) A party directly affected by such a determination may appeal in writing to the Commissioner of Reclamation within
60 days from the date of a regional director's determination. The affected party shall have a total of 90 days from the
date of a regional director's determination within which to submit a supporting brief or memorandum to the Commissioner.

(2) The date of a regional director's determination will be considered to be the date shown on the letter or other document
transmitting the determination. 
(3) The Commissioner may extend the time for submitting a supporting brief or memorandum, provided the affected party
submits a request in writing to the Commissioner and the Commissioner determines the appellant has shown good cause
for such an extension. 
(4) A regional director's determination will have full force and effect during the time an appeal is pending before
the Commissioner, except that upon specific request and showing of good cause by the appellant in a timely notice of
appeal, the Commissioner may hold a regional director's determination in abeyance until a decision has been rendered.

(b) The affected party may appeal the Commissioner's decision to the Secretary of the Interior by writing to the Director,
Office of Hearings and Appeals, within 30 days from the date of mailing of the Commissioner's decision. The appeal
provided in this paragraph (b) shall be governed by 43 CFR Part 4, Subpart G. 
(c) Final decisions on appeals rendered by the Commissioner prior to the effective date of this section are hereby
validated as final agency action and may not be further appealed administratively. 


Subpart A_Revenues Crediting Criteria 


 403.110 

Direct or front-end credit requirements.


Direct or front-end credit will be applied only to those revenues cited in the Second Deficiency Appropriation Act
for 1924 (Fact Finder's Act), Subsection I. 
(a) 

Contract provisions prior to 1938, or specific project legislation.

 To be eligible to receive front-end credit, a water user or district must show that an existing contract had invoked
valid Subsection I revenue provisions prior to 1938, or legislation specific to the project allowed for the direct
crediting of some or all incidental revenues. 
(b) 

Reclamation actions regarding direct (front-end) crediting of revenues. 

Effective January 1, 1994, Reclamation discontinued all unauthorized direct (front-end) crediting of revenues.
Provisions in current contracts between water users or districts and Reclamation purporting to allow direct (front-end)
crediting unauthorized by law are unenforceable and will not be honored. Reclamation will notify directly all water
users or districts affected by this subsection and will provide information concerning rights of appeal.

Program Performance Standards for Head Start Programs Serving Infants, Toddlers, and Pregnant Women



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Administration for Children and Families, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Withdrawal of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document announces the withdrawal of an NPRM published on June 19, 1990 (55 FR 24899), on Program Performance
Standards for Head Start Programs Serving Infants, Toddlers and Pregnant Women. A new NPRM will be published in the
near future on the same subject matter in response to recent reauthorization legislation which amended the Head Start
Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 19, 1990, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families published an NPRM (55 FR 24899) requesting comments
from the public on proposed requirements governing the operation of Head Start programs serving infants, toddlers
and pregnant women. That action was taken to provide standards so that Head Start programs which serve the target population
could ensure the provision of quality service. We are hereby withdrawing that NPRM.




Recent Head Start reauthorization legislation, included in Public Law 103-252, the Human Services Amendments
of 1994 (enacted, May 18, 1994) amends the Head Start Act to require, among other things, promulgation of new standards
for services to infants and toddlers and their families under the Head Start program. Specifically, the Human Services
Amendments of 1994 add to the Head Start Act a new section 645A on ``Programs for Families with Infants and Toddlers'',
which includes a requirement for the development and publication of standards on the new section by December 30, 1994.
In order to comply with this provision in the Act, we must develop new proposed requirements on which the public must
have an opportunity to comment. Therefore, it is necessary to withdraw the previous NPRM.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making





1. On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM) in CC Docket No. 93-22
(released August 31, 1994; FCC 94-200) proposing changes to rules governing the provision of information services
through 800 numbers and pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement. The proposed amendments are intended
to protect consumers from apparently fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision of these
services.


2. The Commission's rules governing interstate pay-per-call and information services were adopted in 1993 to implement
the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). The TDDRA requires that most interstate
information services must be offered exclusively through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access
code and generally prohibits the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. However, under the statute,
800 numbers may be used to provide information services pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement.
In an effect to control potential abuses of the presubscription provisions, the Commission explicitly defined presubscription
as a contractual agreement between an information provider (IP) and a fully informed caller who agrees to purchase
information services under the terms and conditions offered by the IP. Nonetheless, complaints before the Commission
indicate that IPs are apparently charging telephone subscribers for calls placed to 800 numbers without ascertaining
that the subscriber who is charged is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase the service. IPs apparently read the
Automatic Number Identification (ANI) of the originating telephone line to charge the call to the subscriber to that
line without regard to whether the subscriber has placed the call. The Commission expressed particular concern that
such practices threaten the public perception of 800 numbers as being toll-free, a perception and reality that Congress
clearly sought to maintain through the TDDRA.


3. The Commission thus proposed to adopt more stringent requirements governing the establishment of presubscription
arrangements and the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. Specifically,  64.1504 would be amended
to state explicitly that the rule protects not only callers to 800 numbers, but also subscribers whose telephone lines
may be used to place calls to 800 number information services. In addition,  64.1504(b) would prohibit the use
of 800 numbers to connect callers to any information service that is not provided under a presubscription or comparable
arrangement.


4. The Commission also proposed to modify the definition of a presubscription or comparable arrangement contained
in  64.1501(b) to require that such arrangements be established only with a legally competent individual and
executed in writing, unless charges are authorized to a credit or charge card generally accepted for the purchase
of consumer goods, entertainment, travel, and lodging. Section 64.1510(b) would be amended to prohibit common carriers
from billing subscribers for presubscribed information services without evidence of the written agreement. The
amendment would also require common carriers to address bills assessing presubscribed information services charges
only to the individual who entered into the presubscription agreement. Finally, carriers performing billing services
for IPs would be required, without exception, to separate charges for presubscribed information services from charges
for telecommunications services and to display for each information service charge: (1) The type of service and the
service provider's name and business telephone number; (2) the telephone number actually called; (3) the amount
of the charge; (4) the date and time of the call; and (5) for calls billed on a time-sensitive basis, the duration of the
call.


5. The Commission recognized that these proposals would impose new burdens on both common carriers and IPs that have
not engaged in the abuses described above but, nonetheless, concluded that these burdens are outweighed by the need
to protect subscribers from bills for services that neither sought nor received. The Commission encouraged parties
opposing the proposals to identify and quantify, with specificity, any expected burdens and to describe alternative
means of protecting consumers. Finally, the Commission urged interested parties to discuss whether the proposed
rules adequately protect consumers or whether other measures are necessary to guard against deception and evasion
by IPs, particularly when an IP and common carrier are commonly owned or have close business ties.

6. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, the Commission determined that the proposals
contained in the FNPRM may have some impact on small entities due to the proposed requirement the presubscription
be executed in writing. Public comment is requested on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis set out in the
full FNPRM. A copy of the analysis is being sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
in accordance with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a).

7. This notice and comment rulemaking proceeding is non-restricted. Section 1.1206(a) of the Commission's rules,
47 CFR 1.1206(a), contains provisions governing permissible 

ex parte 

contacts.


Ordering Clauses


8. It Is Further Ordered, pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201-205, 228, and 405 of the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i), 154(j), 201-205, 228 and 405, that a Further Notice of Proposed Rule
Making Is Issued, proposing amendment of 47 CFR Part 64 as set forth below.

9. It Is Further Ordered, that pursuant to   1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.415, 1.419,
that all interested parties may file comments on the matters discussed in this Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making
and on the proposed rules contained below by October 10, 1994. Reply comments are due October 31, 1994. All relevant

Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat: Initiation of Status Reviews for Pink
Salmon, Chum Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, Chinook Salmon, and Sea-Run Cutthroat Trout Populations in Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and California 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of finding; initiation of status reviews; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has received three petitions to list several populations of salmon comprising four biological species of Pacific
salmon (

Oncorhynchus

 spp.) from Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula, WA, and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA). In accordance with section 4 of the ESA, NMFS finds that the petitions present substantial scientific
information indicating that listings may be warranted. Therefore, NMFS is initiating a status review on these stocks
to determine if listing is warranted. Moreover, NMFS is initiating comprehensive status reviews for populations
of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout not presently undergoing status reviews in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and
California. Comprehensive, coastwide status reviews are already underway for coho salmon (

O. kisutch

) and steelhead (

O. mykiss

). Species for which comprehensive, coastwide status reviews will be initiated are: Pink salmon (

O. gorbuscha

), chum salmon (

O. keta

), sockeye salmon (

O. nerka

), chinook salmon (

O. tshawytscha

), and sea-run cutthroat trout (

O. clarki clarki

). To ensure that these status reviews are complete, NMFS is soliciting information and data regarding the petitioned
stocks as well as the five species in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Section 4 of the ESA allows interested persons to petition the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) to add a species to or remove a species from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate
critical habitat. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that to the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after
receiving such a petition, the Secretary makes a finding whether the petition presents substantial scientific or
commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. 


Petitions Received 


On March 14, 1994, the Secretary received a petition from the Professional Resource Organization_Salmon (PRO-Salmon
petition) to list nine populations of salmon comprising four biological species from Puget Sound and the Olympic
Peninsula, WA, and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The nine populations are identified as indigenous,
naturally spawning populations of (1) Hood Canal summer chum salmon, (2) Elwha River pink salmon, (3) Lower Dungeness
River pink salmon, (4) North Fork Nooksack River spring chinook salmon, (5) South Fork Nooksack River spring chinook
salmon, (6) Dungeness River spring chinook salmon, (7) Baker River sockeye salmon, (8) Discovery Bay chum salmon,
and (9) White River spring chinook salmon. Subsequently, the Secretary received two additional petitions to list
populations of chum salmon in Mud Bay/Eld Inlet and in Hood Canal, WA, from the Save Allison Springs Citizens' Committee
(April 4, 1994) and Trout Unlimited (May 23, 1994), respectively. 
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, makes a finding that the petition presents substantial scientific
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted based on the criteria specified in 50 CFR 424.14(b)(2),
and based on evidence presented in the petition that the petitioned populations may qualify as ``species'' under
the ESA in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy on Applying the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act to
Pacific Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991). Under section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA, this finding requires that
a review of the status of the petitioned stocks be conducted to determine if the action is warranted.

Systematic Approach for Comprehensive Status Reviews 


During the past 15 months, NMFS has received nine petitions requesting ESA protection for various population segments
of all seven species of 

Oncorhynchus

 found in North America. NMFS has determined that all of these petitions, including those for the 10 Puget Sound populations
covered by this document, present substantial scientific information indicating that listings may be warranted.
However, there are also indications that declines in abundance (and local extinctions) of Pacific salmon and anadromous
trout have occurred over broad geographic areas (e.g., Nehlsen 

et al.

 1991). Furthermore, experience gained from Pacific salmon status reviews conducted by NMFS during the past 3 years
has made it clear that determining the geographic boundaries and biological status of distinct population segments
generally requires assessing populations and habitats occurring outside the range covered by specific petitions.
For this reason, NMFS has initiated comprehensive, coastwide status reviews for two species_steelhead (58 FR 29390,
May 20, 1993; 59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994) and coho salmon (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993) in order to more accurately and
efficiently determine the geographic boundaries and status of distinct population segments. 
NMFS believes it is now prudent to initiate comprehensive status reviews for the remaining species of Pacific salmon
and anadromous trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. These comprehensive reviews will allow NMFS
to conduct a more thorough assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of west coast salmon populations, and
to identify the geographic extent and biological status of populations representing substantial components of
the overall diversity of the biological species. This systematic evaluation will allow NMFS to accomplish the major
goal of the ESA_to conserve the diversity of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit. 


Proposed Timeline To Complete Comprehensive Status Reviews 


NMFS proposes to complete comprehensive species status reviews and publish its determination whether or not to list
the species according to the following schedule: 





In order for NMFS to concentrate efforts towards completion of comprehensive status reviews by the above dates, 1-year
findings for the individual petitoned stocks, due in March, April, and May, 1995, may be delayed. However, NMFS will
complete status reviews for the species identified in the above petitions as soon as possible and will thereafter
promptly propose listings for any species that are found to warrant protection under the ESA. While findings on petitioned
Puget Sound stocks could be delayed, NMFS believes that the comprehensive approach will provide a more thorough and
accurate assessment of the status and risks to anadromous salmonids throughout their ranges in California, Washington,
Oregon, and Idaho.

NMFS has elected to complete the status review for sea-run cutthroat trout last because existing scientific information
regarding this species' life history and population status is extremely scarce. NMFS anticipates that valuable
information for assessing the health of this species will be forthcoming from studies being conducted by the United
States Forest Service and Oregon State University. However, due to the broad geographic scope of these studies (Alaska
to northern California), it will probably be at least 1 year before information is compiled and evaluated in a manner
that will facilitate NMFS' ESA determinations. 


Listing Factors and Basis for Determination 


Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following
reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization
for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Listing
determinations are made solely on the best scientific and commercial data available. 


Biological Information Solicited 


To ensure that the review is complete and is based on the best available scientific and commercial data, NMFS is soliciting
information and comments concerning (1) whether or not any stock qualifies as a ``species'' under the ESA in accordance
with NMFS' policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991), and (2) whether or not any stock is endangered or threatened based
on the above listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information on the petitioned stocks. In general,
NMFS is soliciting information on pink, chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in the following
areas: Physical and biological features of freshwater habitat; life history patterns of juvenile and adult fish,
including age structure and migration patterns; meristic, morphometric, and genetic studies; disease epizootiology;
population abundance and trends in abundance over time; influence of historical and present hatchery fish releases
on naturally spawning stocks; and separation of hatchery and natural salmon/trout escapement. 
To facilitate the compilation of existing information, NMFS will expand its Pacific Salmon Biological Technical
Committees' (PSBTC) meetings in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California to include discussions of all species
of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout. The PSBTCs will provide NMFS with access to experts having a working knowledge
of salmonid populations and will ensure that an accurate and complete administrative record is developed for each
species. All meetings will be open to the public; interested parties should contact NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

) for information regarding locations and times of upcoming PSBTC meetings. 
As noted above, the determination to list a species is based solely on the basis of the best available scientific and
commercial information regarding a species' status without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such
a determination (50 CFR 424.11(b)). Due to the broad scope of the species status reviews identified in this action,
NMFS will attempt to consider information submitted after the comment period (see 

DATES

). However, information must be received no later than 60 days before the proposed scheduled completion date (except
for coho salmon) given in this document to allow NMFS sufficient time to review the material. 


Critical Habitat 


NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for all stocks of pink, chum, sockeye,
and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Areas that include
the physical and biological features essential to the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside
the present distribution should also be identified if such areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential
features should include, but are not limited to: (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;
(2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter;
(4) sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and generally, (5) habitats that are protected from
disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species. 
For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing (1) the activities
that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional
requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation. 
The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designations under the ESA is the probable economic impact
of the [critical habitat] designation upon proposed or ongoing activities (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider the
incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects
attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section
7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the
ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that
can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitat. 
Data, information, and comments should include: (1) Supporting documentation such as maps, bibliographic references,
or reprints of pertinent publications; and (2) the commentor's name, address, and association, institution, or
business.

Foreign Fishing; Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the
Gulf of Mexico (FMP). This rule would increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp harvested from the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico and would eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF)
for royal red shrimp from that area. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the existing regulations implementing
the FMP that would clarify and conform them to current standards and enhance enforcement.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR parts 611 and 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).



Currently, the FMP specifies a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and optimum yield (OY) for royal red shrimp of 392,000
lb (177.8 mt) and estimates the domestic annual harvest (DAH) at 246,036 lb (111.6 mt). All weights are tail weights.
As specified in section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act, the difference between OY and DAH, 145,964 lb (66.2 mt), must be
set aside as TALFF. As a result, the domestic quota for royal red shrimp is 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) and the domestic fishery
must be closed when it reaches that level. 

Amendment 7 would increase the domestic quota of royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico EEZ to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt),
which is 110 percent of the current MSY. The Council considers this level of harvest to be conservative based on the
present estimate of MSY. Amendment 7 explains that the data for determining MSY are sparse (limited recent catch and
effort data), but that the current MSY is based upon the best available scientific information. The FMP indicates
that MSY falls within a range of values between 352,000 lb and 650,000 lb, and provides a single point estimate at the
lower end of this range of 392,000 lb (177.8 mt). Considering the MSY estimate, the Council believes that establishing
the domestic quota at the level of MSY plus 10 percent represents a biologically conservative harvest level. Amendment
7 explains that the Council intends to monitor catch and effort data and adjust MSY and OY as appropriate.

Final Amendment 7, as received from the Council, did not contain an explicit statement of the Council's intent to increase
OY to 110 percent of MSY, as is necessary to allow catch (domestic quota) at that level. To clarify the intent in this
regard, the Council sent NMFS a letter verifying that its intent in Amendment 7 is to increase OY to the level that equals
110 percent of MSY. Based on the Council's clarifying letter, this rule proposes an increase in the domestic quota
from the current 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt) consistent with the increase in OY.

NMFS is concerned that the proposed OY for royal red shrimp is established at a level above MSY. NMFS believes that this
may be inconsistent with National Standard 1 that requires conservation and management measures to prevent overfishing.
Specifically, NMFS is concerned that if fishery harvests were allowed at an OY level above MSY on a continuing basis,
the royal red shrimp stock may be depleted and could sustain adverse effects preventing it from producing fishery
yields at the MSY level over the long term. Amendment 7 indicates that the royal red shrimp resource does not provide
an annual crop as with other shrimp species, but is harvested from grounds believed to contain at least five year classes.
Also, this species does not reach maturity until 3 years of age. Royal red shrimp differ from brown, white, and pink
shrimp in that they are not estuarine dependent, but exist in a relatively constant environment in the deeper waters
of the Gulf of Mexico (100-300 fathoms) (183-549 m). Royal red shrimp are harvested from what are believed
to be at least five year classes, whereas brown, white, and pink shrimp are harvested from one or two year classes. Because
of these biological characteristics, Amendment 7 indicates that royal red shrimp are more vulnerable to overfishing
than other shrimp. Based on these considerations about the OY in relation to MSY and the resource characteristics,
NMFS specifically invites public comments on a proposed OY greater than the MSY.

Since the current TALFF for royal red shrimp was established in 1987, there has been no foreign harvest of royal red
shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The annual domestic harvest of royal red shrimp has varied, but closely approximated
the current domestic quota in 1993, indicating to the Council that U.S. vessels have the capacity and intent to harvest
OY. Accordingly, Amendment 7 would revise the estimate of DAH to equal OY, the domestic quota would equal OY, and TALFF
would be zero. The OY, DAH, and TALFF for royal red shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico, as published on February 3, 1987 (52 FR
3248), would be revised to read, in metric tons, tail weights, as follows:






There are no governing international fisheries agreements that involve the catching of royal red shrimp in the Gulf
of Mexico EEZ and, under this action, there would be neither a TALFF nor a foreign national allocation for such shrimp.
Accordingly, no foreign fishing for royal red shrimp would be allowed in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ, and the provisions
of 50 CFR 611.62 concerning the foreign fishery for royal red shrimp would be removed.



Additional Measures in Amendment 7



Amendment 7 would revise the definition of overfishing for royal red shrimp as exceeding OY (MSY plus ten percent)
in a fishing year. Fishing is to close for the remainder of a fishing year when the OY (MSY plus ten percent) is reached.
Given the lack of data to make a scientifically rigorous estimate of MSY for royal red shrimp, the Council believes
that defining overfishing as exceeding OY (or exceeding MSY by more than 10 percent) in a fishing year still represents
a biologically conservative level of harvest. Amendment 7 provides that: If OY is attained, the royal red shrimp fishery
would be closed; if MSY is exceeded in any fishing year, NMFS would advise the Council and closely monitor the catch
and effort in the fishery; and if MSY is exceeded in 2 consecutive years, the Council would convene its Stock Assessment
Panel to consider the changes in catch and effort and to determine whether the MSY estimate and OY should be revised.
Amendment 7 also proposes a framework measure for changing MSY and OY. Specifically, a revised MSY/OY would be effected
based on a recommendation by the Council's Stock Assessment Panel, approval by the Council's Scientific and Statistical
Committee, adoption by the Council, and implementation by ``Notice Action.'' Given NMFS' concerns about the proposed
royal red shrimp OY exceeding MSY, NMFS is equally concerned as to whether the revised definition of overfishing for
royal red shrimp is consistent with the national standards of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. NMFS is also
concerned whether the proposed framework measure provides assurances of consideration of social and economic factors
and opportunity for public comment on a proposed change to MSY or OY. Accordingly, NMFS specifically invites public
comments on the revised overfishing definition and the proposed framework measure.

Amendment 7 also contains a definition of overfishing for white shrimp; procedures for revising the overfishing
indices for brown, white, and pink shrimp, as required by 50 CFR part 602.11(c); and specific actions to be taken if
overfishing for brown, white, pink, or royal red shrimp occurs. 
These additional measures in Amendment 7 do not require implementing regulations. 
Additional background and rationale for the measures discussed above are contained in Amendment 7, the availability
of which was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1994 (59 FR 39724). 


Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS 


NMFS proposes the following changes to the existing regulations implementing the FMP that would clarify and conform
them to current usage and enhance enforcement. 
 In  658.1, the purpose and scope of the regulations would be restated. In  658.2, unused definitions would
be removed, the geographical extent of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ would be clarified, titles and addresses in the definitions
for ``Regional Director'' and ``Science and Research Director'' would be corrected, the definition for ``shrimp''
would be clarified, and the scientific name for royal red shrimp would be changed to conform to current standards of
the American Fisheries Society. In  658.3, relation to other laws would be revised. In  658.4, explanation
that a permit is not required to fish for shrimp would be restated. 
 In  658.5, the requirements for reporting by vessel owners and operators and by dealers and processors would
clarify that the specified information must be provided when requested. The current practice, whereby fishery reporting
specialists, as designees of the Science and Research Director, collect information by interviewing owners/operators
and dealers/processors would not be changed. Since these specialists are able to ascertain and record areas fished
with the required specificity, the requirement that fishing areas be reported to these specialists in terms of statistical
area would be removed and the definition of statistical area, including the depiction of the areas in Figure 5, would
be removed. Other changes in  658.5(b) are proposed for clarity. 
In  658.6, the requirements for vessel identification would be restated and such identification would be required
on vessels fishing for rock, royal red, and seabob shrimp. In  658.7, the prohibitions would be restated and
prohibitions would be added: (1) Regarding placing material in the water or using fishing gear in a manner to obstruct
fishing or damage vessels and gear and (2) on making a false statement to an authorized officer. In subpart B_Management
Measures, all sections would be reordered and restated. 
The closure provisions for the royal red shrimp fishery, currently at  658.21(c), would be revised to clarify
that a closure of the fishery would be effective on the date specified in the closure notice. While the effective date
of a closure is usually later than the date the notice is filed with the Office of the 

Federal Register

, such closure may be effective as early as that date. NMFS also proposes to clarify the provisions that apply after
a closure and add a prohibition regarding illegal activities after a closure. 
 Two names and two positions of aids to navigation used as points to designate the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, currently
at  658.22, would be corrected to reflect the names and positions for such aids to navigation in the U.S. Coast
Guard Light List. 
Closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, the shrimp/stone trap
separation zones off the western coast of Florida, and off the Texas coast, currently at   658.22, 658.23,
and 658.25, are stated in terms of ``trawl fishing,'' ``trawl gear,'' ``fish(ing) for shrimp,'' and ``trawl fishing,''
respectively. For uniformity and clarity, NMFS proposes to restate the closures, in each case prohibiting ``trawling.''
For the closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, and off the Texas
coast, the change in terminology is not substantive. For the closures of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones,
the change would ease a restriction, in that fishing for shrimp by traps would not be prohibited in the zones/times
in which fishing for shrimp is currently prohibited. In terms of gear separation, which is the purpose of the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones, fixed gear and trawling would continue to be separated.

The current regulations at  658.23(b)(2) prohibit intentional/willful interference with fishing or obstruction
or damage of a fishing vessel or fishing gear. The placement of this prohibition in the paragraph dealing with the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones creates an inference that it applies only in such zones. However, the proposed and final rules
that implemented the prohibition state that it was to apply ``in the FCZ'' (49 FR 20883, May 17, 1984; 49 FR 30713, August
1, 1984). The former FCZ (fisheries conservation zone) is now the EEZ. Because such interference, obstruction, or
damage is reprehensible wherever it occurs, NMFS proposes to clarify that these acts are prohibited throughout the
Gulf of Mexico EEZ. The inclusion of the phrase ``with intent to'' and the word ``willfully'' in the current language
regarding these acts significantly reduces their effectiveness_proof of intent or willfulness is difficult. To
enhance enforceability, NMFS proposes to remove ``with intent to'' and ``willfully'' and substitute ``knowingly''
in each case. Proof of a violation would then hinge on the placement or use of articles or gear that cause obstruction
or damage, such placement or use being other than by accident.
 
The specific procedures and restrictions for creation or modification of shrimp/stone crab separation zones to
prevent gear conflicts, currently at  658.24, and the specific procedures and restrictions for adjusting
the dates of the Texas closure, currently at  658.25(b), would be removed. The specifics for the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones apply to Florida regulatory agencies, the Council, and NMFS. The specifics for the Texas closure
apply to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and NMFS. In both cases, they were approved as management measures
in the FMP. However, they are not regulatory in nature; that is, they do not control the behavior of fishermen. Therefore,
their inclusion in the regulations is not necessary. 


Classification 


Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations
proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time the Secretary has not
determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent with the national standards, other provisions
of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account
the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 
 This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because possible increases in gross revenues for all Gulf
of Mexico shrimp harvesters as a result of this action are expected to be less than 5 percent and capital costs of compliance
are not expected to be significant. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
This rule involves, but does not substantively change, a collection-of-information requirement subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act_namely, vessel and dealer reporting. The collection of this information has been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB Control Number 0648-0013.

658.23 Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. 
658.24 Southwest Florida seasonal closure. 
658.25 Shrimp/stone crab separation zones. 
658.26 Texas closure. 
658.27 Prevention of gear conflicts. 
658.28 Specifically authorized activities. 



Subpart B_Management Measures 



 658.20

Fishing years. 



The fishing year for royal red shrimp begins on January 1. The fishing year for other species of shrimp begins on May
1. 



 658.21

Allowable levels of harvest. 



(a) 

Quotas. 

The quota for royal red shrimp is 431,200 lb (195.6 mt), tail weight. There are no quotas for other species of shrimp.


(b) 

Closures. 

When the quota specified in paragraph (a) of this section is reached, or is projected to be reached, the Assistant Administrator
will file a notice to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register. On and after the effective date of such notice,
for the remainder of the fishing year, royal red shrimp in or from the Gulf of Mexico EEZ may not be retained, and the sale,
purchase, trade, or barter, or attempted sale, purchase, trade, or barter of royal red shrimp taken from the EEZ is
prohibited. The latter prohibition does not apply to trade in royal red shrimp that were harvested, landed, and sold,
traded, or bartered prior to the effective date of the notice in the 

Federal Register

 and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor. 

(c) 

State waters. 

The regulations in this part do not limit the harvest of shrimp in waters landward of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ. However,
harvests from waters landward of the EEZ are taken into account in the calculations of maximum sustainable yield and
optimum yield. 



 658.22

Size limits. 



There are no minimum size limits for shrimp harvested in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ. White shrimp harvested in the EEZ are
subject to the minimum-size landing and possession limits of Louisiana when possessed within the jurisdiction of
that State. 



 658.23

Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. 



(a) The area commonly known as the ``Tortugas shrimp sanctuary,'' off the State of Florida, is closed to trawling.
The area is that part of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ shoreward of a line connecting the following points (see Appendix A of
this part, Figure 1):

waters, as shown on the current edition of NOAA chart 11439, to point U and north to point T, both points as specified
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (see Appendix A of this part, Figure 1). 



 658.24

Southwest Florida seasonal closure. 



From January 1 to 1 hour after sunset (local time) May 20, each year, the area described in this section is closed to trawling,
including trawling for live bait. The area is that part of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ shoreward of a line connecting the following
points (see Appendix A of this part, Figure 2):
 



 





 658.25

Shrimp/stone crab separation zones. 



Five zones are established in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ and Florida's waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation
of shrimp trawling and stone crab trapping. The zones are as shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3. Although Zone
II is entirely within Florida's waters, it is included in this paragraph and Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, for the
convenience of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's
waters are contained in Rule 46-38.001, Florida Administrative Code. Geographical coordinates of the points
referred to in this section and shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, are as follows (loran readings are unofficial
and are included only for the convenience of fishermen):

of the closing or opening date will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


 658.27 

Prevention of gear conflicts. 



(a) No person may knowingly place in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ any article, including fishing gear, that interferes with
fishing or obstructs or damages fishing gear or the fishing vessel of another; or knowingly use fishing gear in such
a fashion that it obstructs or damages the fishing gear or fishing vessel of another. 


(b) In accordance with the procedures and restrictions of the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the
Gulf of Mexico, the Regional Director may modify or establish separation zones for shrimp trawling and the use of fixed
gear as may be necessary and appropriate to prevent gear conflicts. Necessary prohibitions or restrictions will
be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


 658.28 

Specifically authorized activities. 



The Regional Director may authorize, for the acquisition of information and data, activities otherwise prohibited
by the regulations in this part.

North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed specifications for 1995; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) specifications for calendar year 1995. The
specifications would be used to calculate fees to be paid by participants in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish fishery,
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area groundfish fishery, BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries,
and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska (Research Plan fisheries) to fund an observer program
to promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources
off Alaska.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Public
Law 102-582, authorizes the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare, in consultation
with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction,
except salmon fisheries. On September 6, 1994, NMFS published a final rule at 59 FR 46126 to implement the Research
Plan. This rule requires that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and at U.S. fish processors participating
in Research Plan fisheries, including extending these requirements to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers
will be deployed for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding
of fisheries under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also establishes a system of fees to pay for the costs
of implementing the Research Plan, beginning January 1, 1995. The fees are based on the exvessel value of retained
catch from Research Plan fisheries. Additional background and rationale for measures implemented under the Research
Plan are contained in the preamble of the proposed rule published May 6, 1994, and the final rule, and are not repeated
here. 
NMFS is publishing these proposed specifications prior to the effective date of the final rule implementing the Research
Plan. This is necessary because of the requirement for public comment on proposed specifications for the fee collection
program, and because the specifications must be in place before the calendar year for which they apply. It also allows
affected members of the industry to be notified and for the fee collection systems to be put in place. 


Annual Research Plan Specifications 


Section 677.11 of the Research Plan regulations requires NMFS, after consulting with the Council, and, in the case
of observer coverage levels in the crab fisheries, the State of Alaska, to publish certain proposed specifications
for the upcoming calendar year in the 

Federal Register

 and to invite public comments. These proposed specifications include standard exvessel prices, total exvessel
value, fee percentage, levels of observer coverage for Research Plan fisheries, and embarkment/disembarkment
ports for observers. 
NMFS prepared a report, ``Establishing the Fee Percentage and Standard Ex-vessel Prices for 1995,'' for the Council's
consideration at its June 1994 meeting. The report contains details of the derivation of these proposed specifications,
including sources of information and assumptions that are not repeated here. In response to comments received from
the Council and its advisory committees, the report was subsequently revised to provide a greater breakdown of exvessel
prices and to reflect a revised first-year program. Copies of the revised report are available (see 

ADDRESSES

). 
Proposed specifications for calendar year 1995 are as follows: 
1. 

Standard exvessel prices. 

Standard exvessel prices are used to determine the annual fee percentage for the calendar year and are the basis for
calculating bimonthly fee assessments. Standard exvessel prices for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries
are based on: 
a. Exvessel price information by applicable season, area, gear, and processing sector for the most recent 12-month
period for which data are available; 
b. Factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming calendar year; and 
c. Any other relevant information that may affect expected exvessel prices during the calendar year. 
For 1995, proposed standard exvessel prices of species from Research Plan fisheries, based on best available information,
are as follows:

Total exvessel value.

 The total exvessel value of Research Plan fisheries is calculated as the sum of the product of the standard exvessel
prices established for the calendar year and projected retain
