FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD







Methods of Withdrawing Funds From the Thrift Savings Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is proposing to revise regulations on spousal
rights in accordance with changes made to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) by Public Law
103-226 to delete all references to former spouses and to accord all spouses of TSP participants covered by the
Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) the right to a survivor annuity, unless they waive that option.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 103-226, 108 Stat. 111 (March 30, 1994), amends FERSA, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 and section 8351, to give
all TSP participants, regardless of their eligibility for basic retirement benefits, the same withdrawal options
upon separation that have previously been available only to participants who separate with eligibility for basic
retirement benefits. As a result, spouses of all TSP participants, regardless of the participant's eligibility
for basic retirement benefits, have been provided with the same rights as those previously available to spouses of
participants who were eligible for basic retirement benefits. This means that spouses of FERS participants who were
previously only entitled to notice (if the participant separated without eligibility for basic retirement benefits)
now have the right to a survivor annuity, unless the spouse waives that right. The required annuity is a joint life annuity
with the spouse with 50 percent survivor benefits, level payments, and a no cash refund feature. As a result of this
statutory change, 5 CFR 1650.17 has been revised to delete the requirement to notify the spouse with the TSP participant
who is covered by FERS lacks eligibility for basic retirement benefits.



Spouses of Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) participants are entitled to notice whether or not the participant
separated from Federal service with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. This notice requirement was not
affected by Public Law 103-226.

Public Law 103-226 also eliminates the requirement to notify former spouses of FERS and CSRS participants who
separate from Federal service without eligibility for basic retirement benefits that the participant is withdrawing
his or her TSP account. Accordingly, all references to former spouse have been eliminated from 5 CFR part 1650, subpart
G. (Because there are no longer any references to ``former spouses,'' the word ``current'' has also been eliminated
wherever it appeared to describe the spouse to whom a participant is married.) This means that participants are no
longer required to provide the TSP Service Office with an address for a former spouse, or, if a former spouse cannot
be located, to obtain an exception to the requirement to notify a former spouse.

In addition to the changes made by Public Law 103-226, other changes explain or clarify spousal rights and exceptions
to those rights. Section 1650.19 is revised to delete language stating that the employee and spouse may jointly waive
the survivor annuity. The participant waives the survivor annuity by electing a different withdrawal option, while
it is the spouse who must explicitly sign a waiver statement.

Section 1650.21 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's
signature or the spouse notice requirement where the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive
Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. The requirement to obtain the spouse's signature on
the appropriate form to waive the joint and survivor annuity is referred to as the signature requirement. The notice
requirement refers to the entitlement of the spouse of a CSRS participant to notice of the participant's withdrawal
election. This section is being revised to allow participants who are seeking an exception to the signature or the
notice requirement based on whereabouts unknown to submit statements in lieu of affidavits or declarations in support
of their requests. These statements must be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides that whoever, in any matter
within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals
or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements
or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious
or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

To ensure that the persons making the statements are aware of the possible penalty,  1650.21(c) requires inclusion
of the following on each statement: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable
under Federal Law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.

To ease the burden on participants further,   1650.21 and 1650.22 are being revised to delete the requirement
that the participant obtain and provide only documents bearing an original signature or which are embossed or which
bear the imprint of a seal. Participants may now submit photocopies of documents.

Sections 1650.21(d) and 1650.22(c) are added to explain that a withdrawal form received within one year of approval
of the exception may be processed without a new exception. An exception is valid only for the spouse for whom the exception
has been approved.

Sections 1650.21(e) and 1650.22(d) are added to explain that the requirements for establishing an exception in a
loan application in 5 CFR 1655.18 are the same as those for establishing an exception in a withdrawal application.
It is for this purpose that the loan provisions are cross-referenced.

Finally,  1650.22 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement that the participant
obtain his or her spouse's signature where there are exceptional circumstances that warrant such an exception. In
 1650.22(b)(2)(iii) the example of an acceptable court order which would relieve a participant of the obligation
to obtain his or her spouse's signature is revised.

(1) An exception to the spousal signature requirement may be granted based on exceptional circumstances only when
the participant presents a judicial determination (court order) or a governmental agency determination signed
by the appropriate department or division head. A court order or a determination must contain a finding or a recitation
of such exceptional circumstances regarding the spouse as would warrant an exception to the signature requirement.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of referendum. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend the Egg Research and Promotion Order to increase the assessment rate from 5 cents to
10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. This proposal would also make a conforming amendment to regulations.
Notice also is hereby given that the Agricultural Marketing Service will conduct a referendum to determine whether
egg producers favor an increase in the assessment rate under the egg research and promotion program. Ballots and instructions
will be mailed directly to all known egg producers owning over 75,000 laying hens.

Background and Proposed Changes 



The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) was amended December 14, 1993 (Pub. Law 103-188.
The amendments raised the maximum rate of assessment paid by egg producers to the American Egg Board (AEB) from 10 cents
to 20 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The actual rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order
and is currently 5 cents per case. Any increase from the 5 cents must be approved by producers voting in a referendum.


A proposed rule to increase the assessment rate in the Order from 5 cents to 10 cents per case was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31174). Comments were solicited from interested persons through August 16, 1994. Two comments
were received; one from a major egg producer organization in support and one from an egg producer in opposition to the
increase. 

The commenter who opposed the increase cited the decline in number of egg producers from 10,000 to 400 since AEB has
been in existence and that AEB programs have not halted the decline. However, the decrease in the number of producers
paying assessments is the result of several factors. First, when AEB was first implemented in 1976, more than 6,000
producers owning over 3,000 laying hens were on record. By 1989, the number had decreased to approximately 2,000 due
to consolidations and bankruptcies during a time when the economic situation was poor. In 1990, the exemption level
was changed to 30,000 laying hens, decreasing the number of producers by 36 percent. The exemption level was changed
again on August 1, 1994, to 75,000 hens, reducing the number to just under 400 producers. 

The commenter also expressed disapproval that a large percentage of the proposed increase in funds might be used for
advertising, resulting in a temporary boost in demand and that such demand would be quickly swallowed up by expanded
production. The commenter also noted that AEB has a function in the industry but must remain lean to ensure funds are
spent wisely. The commenter expressed concern that AEB not look for budget expenditures to justify the increased
assessment. AEB's administrative costs have steadily remained at approximately 3 percent. Further, as required
by the 1993 amendments to the Act, AEB submitted to the Department a marketing analysis showing the need for an assessment
increase. 

The commenter was also opposed to the referendum voting rules. The commenter indicated that the rules allow the number
of hens owned to give more weight to the vote, thereby granting larger producers more voting power. The Act provides
that a referendum vote will pass if approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting 

or

 by a majority of producers voting if they represent not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced. 

The commenter further was of the view that the assessment rate should remain at its current level of 5 cents, that producers
should be allowed to voluntarily give an extra 5 or 10 cents, and that refunds should be available. The Act was amended
in 1993 to provide that AEB may recommend an increased assessment rate to the Secretary. In accordance with the provisions
of the Act, AEB has done so, and the assessment increase as proposed herein will be subject to a referendum vote. 

It is directed that, in accordance with the procedures for the conduct of referenda (7 CFR 1250.200 et seq.), a referendum
will be held beginning September 26, 1994, and ending on October 14, 1994, to determine whether producers favor the
increase to 10 cents per case as proposed. 

Section 9 of the Act requires approval by eligible egg producers engaged in commercial egg production during the representative
period and at the time of voting. The representative period for the conduct of the referendum is determined to be May
1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. 

For the Order amendment to be approved, it must be favored by at least two-thirds of the producers voting in this referendum


or

 by a majority of the producers voting if such majority represents not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced
by those voting. 

The agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated to be Janice L. Lockard and Angela C. Clonts,
both of the Poultry Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. The agents may appoint subagents to assist them
in performing their duties. 

Ballots, instructions, eligibility requirements, and other information pertinent to the referendum will be mailed
to all known eligible egg producers. In accordance with Public Law 103-188 and recent amendments to the implementing
Order (59 FR 38875), producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments under the Act
and are therefore not eligible to vote in the referendum.

9456, Washington, D.C. 20090-6456. Copies of the complete text of the Egg Research and Promotion Order, as amended,

1995 Rice Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage, if any, and the national
average price support rate for the 1995 crop of rice. This action is required by section 101B of the Agricultural Act
of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This proposed rule outlines a range of acreage reduction percentage options proposed
for the 1995 crop of rice and requests comments regarding price support rate adjustments for different types and grades
of rice.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 
 

This proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 
 

It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared that determined that this regulation
will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction
percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in
the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule
and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. 



Environmental Evaluation 
 

It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 


Federal Assistance Program 
 

The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this proposed rule applies, are: Rice Production Stabilization_10.065. 


Executive Order 12778 
 

This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule
do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies.



Executive Order 12372 
 

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 


Paperwork Reduction Act 
 

The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require
clearance by OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. 



Request for Public Comment 
 

Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the
final rule. 


Background 
 

In accordance with section 101B of the 1949 Act, an acreage reduction program (ARP) may be implemented for the 1995
rice crop if it is determined that the total supply of rice, in the absence of such a program, would be excessive taking
into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices, and to meet
a national emergency. 
 Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of rice to desirable
goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed
to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice. 
 If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent)
to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of
acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the
Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration. 
 Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted
in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect
to that crop on the farm.

The Secretary is required to carry out an acreage limitation program in a manner that will result in carry-over stocks
equal to 16.5 to 20.0 percent of the simple average of the total disappearance (including domestic, export, and residual
disappearance) of rice for each of the 3 marketing years preceding the year for which the announcement is made. The
1995-crop options considered are: 


 
Option 1. 0-percent ARP. 
 Option 2. 2.5-percent ARP. 
 Option 3. 5.0-percent ARP. 





The estimated impacts of these options are shown in this table. 






 
Accordingly, comments are requested whether to establish an ARP for the 1995 rice crop, and if so, at what reduction
percentage. 
 The final determination of this percentage will be set forth at 7 CFR 1413.54(a)(4)(iv) and (v). 
 In accordance with section 403 of the 1949 Act, appropriate adjustments may be made in the support price for any commodity
for differences in grade, type, staple, quality, location, and other factors.

A difference of $1.00 per hundredweight between the support rates for milled whole kernels of long and medium/short
grain has been effective since the 1987 crop year. Comments are requested regarding an appropriate difference between
price support rates for milled whole kernels of long grain and medium/short grain for the 1995 crop of rice. 

Discounts for price support rates for lower grades of rice have been established for prior crop years at levels reflecting
the lower market value of such rice. Rice price support loan rates are currently subject to discounts that have been
effective since 1983. These discounts are $0.30 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade 

#

3, $0.60 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade 

#

4, $1.00 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade 

#

5, and $2.00 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade 

#

6. Accordingly, comments are requested as to the level of premiums and discounts that would be appropriate for any
grade of 1995-crop rice.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed special conditions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to amend special conditions issued to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe) (Currently
Jetstream Aircraft Limited) for the BAe Model 4100 airplane. This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated
with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45 were issued on July 9, 1991, addressing
this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that the
special conditions be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers. Since the special
conditions were issued the applicant has changed the company name and revised the model number of the airplane. This
amendment of the special conditions should also reflect these changes. Since the applicable airworthiness regulations
do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, this notice contains
the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes.




</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited




Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of these proposed special conditions by submitting such
written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice
number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the
closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on this proposal. The proposal
contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available in
the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report
summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.
Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket
No. NM-53.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped, and returned to the commentor.



Background



On May 24, 1989, BAe Public Limited Company (currently Jetstream Aircraft Ltd.) applied for a type certificate for
the BAe Model 4100 (currently Jetstream Model 4101) airplane in the transport airplane category. The Model 4100 was
to be a derivative of the Model 3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like
the Model 3100, the Model 4100 was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however,
to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section
as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional main cabin aisle arrangement.

Section 25.815 species the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger
capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less above
the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained.
Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned
by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these
width criteria. Long standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition
from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally.
For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating
which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at
all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points
in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch
dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle.

The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies
are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This
arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required
15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle''
is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback
to seatback. Nonetheless, there 

is

 a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle
width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback
height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset
longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane.

In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in the BAe Model 4100 airplanes,
the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions
No. 25-ANM-45 utilized the existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model
4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45 are summarized as follows:

a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle;

b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits;

c. In addition to the requirements of  25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height
of 43 inches above the aisle floor;

d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one
end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the
cabin;

e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil
airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and

f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement.

The content of the special conditions was based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific
limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that
this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant
factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement.

Subsequent to issuing the Special Conditions 25-ANM-45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate
for that project British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited and changed
the model designation for the airplane from BAe Model 4100 to the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was
issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993 for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated
that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model
4101, Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes
that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.101, Jetstream must show that 30 passenger Model 4100 series airplanes comply with
the regulations in the type certification basis established for the 29 passenger Jetstream Model 4101 airplane.
The type certification basis for the Model 4101 is as follows:

The certification basis for the Model 4101 is established in accordance with  21.29, using the Joint Aviation
Regulations (JAR) as a reference point, with appropriate additional requirements incorporated to provide an equivalent
certification basis to the FAR requirements for U.S. certification. British Aerospace and the Civil Aviation Authorities
(CAA)-UK elected to have the type certification basis be the following:




_JAR 25 as amended through Change 12 dated May 10, 1988;

_JAR 25 Orange Paper Amendment 88-1 effective October 18, 1988;

_JAR 1, definitions as amended through Change 4 dated June 1, 1987; and

_any additional part 25 paragraphs necessary to provide a composite type certification basis equal to the required
part 25 type certification basis.




Based on   21.29 and 21.17 and the type certification application date, the applicable U.S. type certification
basis was established as follows:




_Part 25 dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through 25-66;

_any applicable special conditions issued;

_any applicable exemptions granted;

_any equivalent safety findings made;

_the fuel venting requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 27, including Amendments 27-1 through
the latest amendment in effect on the date the Model 4100 is type certificated, and

_Part 36, including Amendments 36-1 through the latest amendment in effect on the date of TC.




If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual
design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 after public notice, as required
by   11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Novel or Unusual Design Features



The 30 passenger seat version of the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes incorporate(s) the same novel or unusual
aisle configuration as described above for the 29 seat version.

As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements
taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline
above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required
15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch
width vertically, the 20-inch position would not be centered over the 15-inch position (See Figure 1.) 

 














In establishing Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45, the FAA carefully evaluated the relevant design parameters
of the BAe Model 4100 and determined that the main aisle configuration is clearly not what was envisioned by the regulations.
The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated
on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement.
Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent
to configurations on which the regulations were based. 

Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45 to allow a maximum passenger
capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream contends
that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities
(JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with
the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably. 

Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions
for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers.
Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist. 

In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the
29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number
of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exits and one pair of Type III exits for 29 passenger seats, where
the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer.
Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger capacity, and the issue of harmonization did not come up.


With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration
was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use
of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The
demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers.
While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly
fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree
than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall
egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result
in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations.

Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30
passengers in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted for
approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for the
JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of amending
the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passengers is somewhat
arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised.



One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger
arrangement proposed by Jetstream still complies with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located
on the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that
occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the
passageway for the aft exit.



These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and
safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate,
requirements have been drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve
the level of safety which is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that
an additional passenger does not invalidate the existing special conditions. It is noted however, that further increase
in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result in more than ten seat rows on
at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would very likely require the development
of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered aisle should limit the passenger
seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations. Under the terms of these special
conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum.



As in the case of Special Conditions No. 25-ANM-45, an evacuation demonstration would be required for
the 30-passenger version. Since the applicant chose to conduct it with 30 rather than 29 passengers, the evacuation
demonstration conducted for the 29-passenger version would show compliance with this requirement for the 30-passenger
version as well.



Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of  25.815, the following amended special conditions are proposed
for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed
based on further FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).



As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30 passenger version of
the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change
to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design
feature, the special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final
rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA has determined that public
comment would be in the public interest, but will shorten the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance
of the final special conditions.




Conclusion





This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on one Model of airplanes. It is not a rule of general
applicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter
Corporation Model F-28, F-28A, F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX
series helicopters, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of a certain main rotor transmission
clutch assembly (clutch assembly) for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil level and, if necessary,
replacement of the clutch assembly. The current AD also requires replacement of the clutch assembly at certain time-in-service
intervals. This action would require the same inspections and replacements as required by the current AD, but would
provide an additional approved replacement part number and provide a reference to three additional manufacturer
service documents. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly,
loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Availability of NPRMs


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention:
Rules Docket No. 93-SW-27-AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137-4298.



Discussion 


On January 23, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89-04-09, Amendment 39-6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989),
to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain main rotor transmission clutch assemblies for bearing
roughness, noise, lock-up, and improper oil levels. AD 89-04-09 also requires replacement of the main
rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) when unairworthy, and establishes a 1,200 hours time-in-service
retirement life on the clutch assembly. That action was prompted by several failures of the clutch assembly. Based
on an analysis of the clutch assembly failure data, the FAA, in conjunction with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
and Formsprag, the clutch assembly manufacturer, determined that the clutch assembly, 
P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through -7), could not be safely overhauled and returned
to service. The FAA has determined that premature failure of the clutch assembly due to a loss of lubricant creates
an unsafe condition. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control
of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved the use of clutch assembly, part number (P/N) 28-13401-4
(Formsprag CL 40526-10), in addition to the earlier clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag
CL 40526-8) as replacement clutch assemblies. Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of AD 89-04-09,
The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0069, Revision A, dated
July 9, 1990, that contains an overhaul time interval for clutch assemblies, P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag
CL 40526-8) and P/N 28-13401-4 (Formsprag CL 40526-10). Also, AD 89-04-09 referenced
neither Enstrom Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978, pertaining to checking the run-out
of the main rotor pinion shaft nor Enstrom SDB No. 0068, dated May 8, 1986, subsequently reissued July 9, 1990, pertaining
to the retirement life of the clutch assembly. Finally, a note contained in AD 89-04-09 incorrectly referenced
SIL ``0038A''; the reference should have been SIL ``No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980.''

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 89-04-09 to require initial and repetitive inspections of
certain clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil levels and, if necessary, immediate
replacement of the clutch assembly. Owner/operator checks are proposed after engine start and rotor engagement
to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly and, after each engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still turning
down, to check for abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the upper pulley that houses the clutch
assembly. These proposed owner/operator checks do not require the use of tools, precision measuring equipment,
training, pilot logbook endorsements, or the use of technical data not contained in the AD. Additionally, these owner/operator
checks are considered part of the normal pilot ``Before Takeoff'' and ``After Landing'' checks and were allowed by
the existing AD. These owner/operator checks are additional measures to ensure, between 25 hours TIS inspections,
that sufficient lubricants are maintained in the clutch assembly and not lost through a leaking seal. These checks
may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft
records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation
Regulations. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the clutch assembly at certain TIS intervals.
The FAA estimates that 162 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $2,800 to overhaul or $10,500 for a zero-time clutch assembly per helicopter.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be from $471,420,
if only overhauled clutch assemblies are installed, to $1,718,820, if only zero-time clutch assemblies are used.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39-6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989), and by adding a new
airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: 






The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom): 

Docket No. 93-SW-27-AD. Supersedes AD 89-04-09, Amendment 39-6138. 






Applicability: 

Model F-28, F-28A, F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters,
certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent failure of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly), loss of control of the main rotor
system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: 

(a) For Model F-28, F-28A, F-28C, F-28C-2, 280, and 280C series helicopters, equipped
with clutch assembly part number (P/N) 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7) perform
the following: 

(1) Before the first flight of each day, before takeoff, gently close the throttle, splitting the tachometer needles
to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly. If the tachometer needles do not split, before further flight,
inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4). 
(2) At the conclusion of the last flight of each day, after engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still running down,
listen for any abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the area of the upper pulley that houses the
clutch assembly. If any abnormal noise is heard from the clutch assembly, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance
with paragraph (a)(4). 
(3) The operational checks required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) may be performed by an owner/operator holding
at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD
in accordance with 14 CFR 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v). 
(4) If any irregularities are noted while performing the procedures required by paragraph (1) or (2), inspect the
clutch assembly to determine if it is locked-up, or if the upper pulley will rotate. Rotate it in both directions while
feeling for any bearing roughness and listening for any bearing noise. The upper pulley should free-wheel if rotated
in a clockwise direction and engage if rotated in a counterclockwise direction. 
(5) Within the next 25 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD),
make an entry in the aircraft log book documenting the clutch assembly part number, the number of hours TIS, and the
date.

(6) Within the next 25 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours
TIS, inspect the clutch assembly for proper oil level in accordance with the appropriate maintenance manual. If there
has been less than a complete loss of oil, replenish the oil and service the clutch assembly in accordance with The Enstrom
Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter No. 0079A, dated February 14, 1980. 
(7) If there has been a complete oil loss, or lock-up, noise, or roughness are detected from the clutch assembly as a
result of the inspections required by this AD, before further flight, replace the clutch assembly, 
P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7), with an airworthy clutch assembly, P/N
28-13401-2 (Formsprag CL 40526-8) or P/N 28-13401-4 (Formsprag CL 40526-10).

(8) For a clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7), that has 1,175
or more hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, within the next 25 hours TIS, replace the clutch assembly with an airworthy
clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag CL 40526-8) or P/N 28-13401-4 (Formsprag
CL 40526-10). 
(9) For a clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7), that has less
than 1,175 hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, replace the clutch assembly with an airworthy clutch assembly,
P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag CL 40526-8) or P/N 28-13401-4 (Formsprag CL 40526-10),
prior to the clutch assembly accumulating 1,200 hours TIS. 






Note: 

The clutch service information published in The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) Service Note No. 0027,
dated December 9, 1975; Enstrom Service Information Letter No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978; Enstrom Service Information
Letter No. 0079A, dated February 14, 1980; Service Information Letter No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980,
Enstrom Service Directive Bulletin No. 0068, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990; and Enstrom Service Directive Bulletin
No. 0069, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990; pertains to this AD. 




(b) For Model F-28F, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, accomplish the following: 
(1) Within the next 25 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, determine the part number of the clutch assembly.

(2) If a clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7), is found, before
further flight, replace it with an airworthy clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag CL 40526-8)
or P/N 28-13401-4 (Formsprag CL 40526-10). The clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag
CL 40526-1 through-7), is not approved for use on Enstrom Model F-28F, 280F, or 280FX series helicopters.
(c) Installation of a clutch assembly, P/N 28-13401-2 (Formsprag CL 40526-8) or P/N 28-13401-4
(Formsprag CL 40526-10), on Model F-28, 
F-28A, F-28C, F-28C-2, F-28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters constitutes
a terminating action for the requirements of 
this AD. 
(d) This AD establishes a retirement life of 1,200 hours TIS for the clutch assembly, 
P/N 28-13401-1 (Formsprag CL 40526-1 through-7). However, for clutch assemblies with 1,175
or more hours TIS on the effective date of this AD, those clutch assemblies need not be retired until on or before the
accumulation of an additional 25 hours TIS. 
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit
their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager,
Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. 






Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. 




(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

Airworthiness Directives; Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) Model 
MBB-BK 117 Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland
GmbH (ECD) Model MBB-BK 117 series helicopters. This proposal would require a modification of the latches on
the transmission and engine cowlings access doors. This proposal is prompted by five occurrences of an engine or transmission
cowling access door becoming loose in flight. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the
transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently,
separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control
of the helicopter.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-SW-06-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 



Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention:
Rules Docket No. 94-SW-06-AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137-4298.




Discussion 



This notice proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD), that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland
GmbH (ECD) Model MBB-BK 117 series helicopters, serial numbers (S/N) 7001 through 7201. Since 1986, there have
been five reports of the engine or transmission cowling access doors opening in flight which, in several cases, resulted
in damage to the main rotor blades. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved MBB-Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin ASB-MBB-BK 117-20-104,
Revision 1, dated December 8, 1989, that describes procedures for removing and modifying various latches of the access
doors of the transmission and engine cowlings, installing new locks, and providing the cowlings, firewalls, and
fuselage with appropriate mating components. Transmission and engine cowlings that open in flight can damage the
rotor systems and, therefore, create an unsafe condition.

<TEXT>
 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other ECD Model MBB-BK 117
helicopters of the same type design, the proposed AD would require replacing the current latches with those having
positive locks, relocating certain latches, and installing additional locks on the transmission and engine cowling
access doors within the next 150 hours time-in-service. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously. 

The FAA estimates that 126 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
45 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $624 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $390,474. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to approve Illinois' 1990 base year ozone
precursor emissions inventory for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation
Plan (SIP). The emissions inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that
States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions. The Illinois
ozone nonattainment areas covered by the ozone emissions inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Chicago,
Metro-East St. Louis, and Jersey County. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision request without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial
revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
the public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. A second comment
period on this action will not be held. Parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time.

Operating Permit Program: Proposed Interim Approval; Minnesota Pollution Control Agency


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed interim approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes interim approval of the Operating Permit Program submitted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
(MPCA) for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA,
programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background and Purpose


A. Introduction


As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define
the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permit program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permit programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July
21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop,
and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other
sources.
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant
to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.


B. Scope


MPCA's permitting rule, Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007, combines the State's preconstruction and operating permit
programs into a single permitting program. This approval is limited solely to Minnesota's part 70 operating permit
program submittal of November, 15, 1993. This is not a rulemaking under section 110 of the Act. The State has submitted
a separate request for approval of this rule as a preconstruction permitting program and a federally enforceable
state operating permit program as a revision to the State Implementation Plan.
Minnesota's submittal includes a statement that the program will be enforceable in the entire State of Minnesota
except Indian tribal lands. Because MPCA has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian
law and Federal Indian policies, legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval
of Minnesota's operating permits program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation
in the State of Minnesota.

1

 Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota will be subject to either
the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program
approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section
301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.

II. Proposed Action and Implications


A. Analysis of State Submission


1. Support Materials 
Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, submitted Minnesota's part 70 Operating Permit Rule on November 15, 1993,
requesting source category-limited interim approval of the State's program. The Commissioner of MPCA has the authority
to submit this rule on behalf of the Governor of Minnesota under Minnesota Statutes section 116.03, subdivision 3.
The submittal contained all required elements under 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Minnesota's operating
permit program, permitting program documentation, and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the
State of Minnesota provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the program required by the Clean Air Act.


2. Regulations and Program Implementation 


The Minnesota permitting regulations (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007) substantially meet the requirements of 40
CFR 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content including operational flexibility; 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 with
respect to permit processing requirements (including public participation and minor permit modifications); and
40 CFR 70.11 with respect to requirements for enforcement authority. The Minnesota permitting regulations meet
the requirements of 40 CFR 70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability and 40 CFR 70.5 with respect to criteria which
define insignificant activities and complete application forms.
Minnesota Rules 7007.0100, subpart 26 defines ``Title I modification'' as ``any change that constitutes a modification
under any provision of [T]itle I of the Act.'' In addition, Minnesota's rule specifically includes major modifications
under parts C and D of title I, modifications subject to a New Source Performance Standard, and modifications subject
to a National Emission standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) or any other rules adopted by the Administrator
under section 112 of the Act. Commissioner Charles Williams states in his April 19, 1994, letter that Minnesota interprets
its definition to include modifications made pursuant to a preconstruction permitting program approved into the
State Implementation Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act. The EPA is soliciting comment, as part of the proposal
to revise part 70, on the proper definition of ``Title I modifications.'' However, EPA believes that Minnesota's
definition, in light of this clarification, would be consistent with any definition of ``Title I modifications''
EPA may adopt.
For further discussion on the State's regulations, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this approval. The program submittal meets the program requirements of title V and 40 CFR part 70 except as discussing
in II.B of this document.


3. Permit Fee Demonstration 


Minnesota's fee collection rule, Minnesota Rules 7002.0035, sets the minimum amount of funding the State receives
from title V sources by multiplying the number of tons of regulated pollutants listed in the most recent available
emissions inventory, with a maximum of 4,000 tons per pollutant per facility, by $25 + the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
per ton. However, the current definition of regulated pollutant in MPCA's fee rule (Minnesota Rules 7007.0015, subpart
4) does not include particulate matter greater than 10 microns in diameter, total reduced sulfur, hydrogen chloride,
or sulfuric acid mist, all of which are included in the Federal definition. MPCA intends to remedy this discrepancy
in a rulemaking scheduled for 1994. When this discrepancy has been corrected, MPCA's fee rule will set the minimum
funding the State will receive at the presumptive minimum. However, during the first year after interim approval
is granted, the fees that the State of Minnesota will be collecting, which has already been established through the
State's regulations, will result in collection of a dollar per ton amount less than the presumptive minimum.
Minnesota will collect $6,558,000 in emission fees for the first year of its program, and has demonstrated that the
fees collected will be sufficient to run the program for the first year. However, the fee demonstration in Minnesota's
submittal does not contain all information required by 40 CFR 70.9. Specifically, Minnesota's fee demonstration
does not contain an estimate of permit program costs for the first four years after program approval. Therefore, the
State's fee demonstration may only be given an interim approval.
In order for the State to receive full approval of it's program, the State must either change its definition of regulated
air pollutant in its fee rule to include all pollutants included in the Federal definition, or it must submit a four
year projection of costs and fees to be collected that demonstrates that the State will collect fees in an amount sufficient
to run its program.


4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 




a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.

 Minnesota has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all
section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Minnesota's enabling legislation
and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and stating that the permit must incorporate
all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow Minnesota to issue
permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Minnesota is able to implement and enforce all section 112
requirements. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this rulemaking and the April 13, 1993, guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for section
112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.


b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.

 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Minnesota is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the date of approval of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally
enforceable restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Minnesota's preconstruction
permitting program found in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7007 under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose
of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule
implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Minnesota has a mechanism
in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval.
Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air toxics programs, title V and section
112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section
112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section 112(g) and does not confer or imply approval
for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example section 110. If Minnesota does not wish to implement
section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing
section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Minnesota's part 70 program, approve the alternative
instead.
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts rules implementing regulations promulgated
by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval to a reasonable
time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Minnesota, acting expeditiously, will be able
to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit the duration
of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is solicited on
whether 18 months is an appropriate period considering Minnesota's procedures for adoption of regulations.


c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.

 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for
approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources.
Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing
to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Minnesota's program for receiving delegation of section
112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Minnesota has informed EPA that it intends
to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism
will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Minnesota and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval
of Minnesota's section 112(l) program for delegation of unchanged Federal standards. This program applies to both
existing and future standards, but is limited to sources that will obtain part 70 permits.


d. Title IV.

 Minnesota's program contains adequate authority to issue permits which reflect the requirements of title IV and
its implementing regulations. In addition, Minnesota's submittal contains a commitment to revise its regulations
as necessary to accommodate Federal revisions and additions to title IV and the Acid Rain regulations once they are
promulgated.


B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications


The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permit program submitted by Minnesota on November
15, 1993. If this approval is promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval: 



1. Remove from the State's legislation Minnesota Statutes section 609.671, subdivision 14 which provides an exemption
from criminal prosecution for sources which give notice of a violation and take reasonable steps to remedy the violation.

2. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 6 to clearly state that all part 70 sources must submit semi-annual reports.

3. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 to be consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d). Minnesota Rules 7007.1400
provides that the administrative amendment procedure may be used to ``clarify a permit term.'' This ambiguous provision
is not consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d) and could be interpreted broadly enough to allow changes
to a permit which should be handled through the permit modification procedures. 
4. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 to require that the permit terms included in 40 CFR 70.6(a) be expressly
stated in part 70 permits. Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 allows permit terms which are required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)
to be included in the permit by reference to the state regulation. Failure to have these provisions expressly stated
in the permit may create difficulties in enforcing those terms and may make it difficult for citizens to understand
what provisions apply to a source. 
5. Revise the definition of regulated pollutant at Minnesota Rules 7002.0035 to include any ``regulated pollutant
for presumptive fee calculation'' as defined at 40 CFR 70.2, or submit a detailed fee demonstration containing all
required elements under 40 CFR 70.9. 
6. Revise Minn. Rules 7007.0750, subpart 2.C to require the permitting authority to take action on minor and moderate
permit amendments within 90 days of receipt of a complete application.

 

This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period,
the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal
permit program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect
to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim
approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.


Minnesota has requested Source Category-Limited (SCL) interim approval of its part 70 operating permit program.
Although the State would be required to issue permits within 3 years to all sources subject to the program that obtains
interim approval, some sources would not be subject to the requirement to obtain a permit until full approval is granted.
Part 70 sources which are not addressed until full approval are also subject to the 3-year time period for processing
initial permit applications. The 3-year period for these sources would begin on the date full approval of the State's
program is granted. Therefore, initial permitting of all part 70 sources might not be completed until 5 years after
interim approval is granted.
Minnesota has presented the following as compelling reasons for why SCL interim approval should be granted in the
November 15, 1993, submittal:



1. Minnesota does not have nonattainment areas for ozone. Consequently, Minnesota has not adopted Volatile Organic
Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology rules, nor does it have its own State air toxics rules. Therefore,
MPCA and the facilities regulated by the air toxics program are not familiar with and have not implemented measures
to control VOC emissions. MPCA staff and the regulated community will need additional time to catch up with other States
in becoming familiar with control techniques and to identify and contact VOC/toxic sources. 
2. Minnesota has a variety of large, complex sources which require extensive amounts of time to permit. The time spent
issuing permits to these sources will take considerable time away from issuing permits to other sources, making it
impossible given MPCA's resource constraints for MPCA to issue permits to all part 70 sources within 3 years. 
3. MPCA expects to lose a portion of its experienced permitting engineers to private industry when facilities are
required to submit permit applications. The time which is necessary to train new staff as this occurs will increase
the amount of time needed to issue a permit. 
4. Although MPCA has almost doubled its staff since January of 1992 in anticipation of the workload associated with
title V, the workload will surpass available resources. MPCA intends to request additional funding during the 1995
legislative session; however, MPCA will still be unable to take final action on all applications within 3 years.

 

EPA believes Minnesota has presented compelling reasons for a SCL interim approval.


The EPA believes that a program granted SCL interim approval must apply to at least 60 percent of all part 70 sources,
which are responsible for at least 80 percent of the aggregate emissions from all part 70 sources. The EPA requires
a demonstration that these criteria are met when a significant percentage of sources or aggregate emissions are excluded
from the interim program. The Minnesota submittal which included a schedule for permitting part 70 sources which
would permit 60.71 percent of part 70 sources emitting 81.35 percent of aggregate emissions from part 70 sources within
3 years of program approval met the criteria.d.
EPA believes that SCL interim approval is warranted for Minnesota's program. For further discussion on EPA's determination,
see the Technical Support Document accompanying this approval.


III. Administrative Requirements


A. Request for Public Comments


The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information
relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The
docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the
development of this proposed approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:



(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the approval process; and
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by October 13, 1994.



B. Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.


C. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
Interim approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements
that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal approval of a State operating permit program does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover,
EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this
disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not
remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.

Proposed Rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Since the mid-1970's, the General Services Administration has imposed rigid building temperature and air circulation
standards in the buildings it owns and manages. These standards were established to promote energy conservation
without appropriate attention to occupant comfort and productivity. The results of a recent survey of GSA's building
occupants showed a low customer satisfaction in the areas of building temperatures and indoor air quality. These
results, plus the introduction of new building energy technologies which provide energy conservation without diminution
of comfort and service to building occupants, allow GSA to eliminate rigid temperature standards.



This proposed rule will eliminate operating standards and allow for building temperatures to be maintained in a manner
satisfactory to users and consistent with local commercial practices. In addition, it will delete the minimum ventilation
rate and replace it with the ventilation standards specified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE Standard 62 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality). This will improve
temperature comfort levels, ventilation, and the indoor air quality of buildings. This will, in turn, improve customer
satisfaction and productivity.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12862_Setting Customer Service Standards. Executive Order 12862 states that in order to carry out
the principles of the National Performance Review, the Federal Government must be customer-driven. GSA, in an effort
to become more customer driven, seeks to improve customer satisfaction, by changing regulations that have a direct
effect on three areas of low customer satisfaction. GSA's customers, building tenants, have indicated by their responses
to customer surveys that they have very low satisfaction levels for the following: ventilation, 42 percent satisfied;
indoor air quality, 44 percent satisfied; summer temperature, 53 percent satisfied; and winter temperature, 56
percent satisfied.



The two sections of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) addressed in this proposal mandate space
temperatures and ventilation rates that contribute to low customer satisfaction. These changes will permit the
Buildings Managers to control building temperatures and mandate adherence to the latest air ventilation guidelines.
On April 11, 1994 the Administrator of GSA granted a class deviation for the two sections of the FPMR. This action made
the changes recommended in this proposed rule effective immediately for GSA buildings.



Executive Order 12866



The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for
the purposes of Executive Order 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



GSA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities

Insurance Cost Information Regulation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, NHTSA proposes technical amendments to the insurance cost information regulations. Among the
proposed changes are revising the term ``passenger motor vehicles'' to read ``passenger cars, utility vehicles,
light duty trucks, and vans,'' and revising from January to March, the availability date of the insurance information.
NHTSA also proposes making more explicit the limitations of the collision loss data, and proposes recommending that
prospective purchasers contact insurance agents for more information. The technical amendments are proposed to
make the insurance cost information more accurate.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Insurance Cost Information Regulation 


49 U.S.C. 32302(c) states that the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) shall prescribe regulations that
require passenger motor vehicle dealers to distribute to prospective purchasers information developed by the Secretary
and provided to the dealer which compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger
motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness. By delegation from the Secretary,
NHTSA has been authorized to carry out the statute. 

On January 31, 1975, NHTSA published 49 CFR part 582, Insurance Cost Information Regulation (40 FR 4918). Part 582,
as then promulgated, required that automobile dealers ``make available to prospective purchasers information
reflecting differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon
differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness.'' Part 582, however, did not specify information that
dealers must provide. 

On March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12545), NHTSA published a final rule amending part 582. The rule complemented the 1975 rulemaking,
and completed implementation of section 32302(c). The March 1993 final rule, which became effective April 5, 1993,
requires dealers of new automobiles to make collision loss experience data available in booklets to prospective
purchasers. The information to be provided in the booklet is specified in section 582.5, which requires inclusion
of a complete explanatory text and updated data on auto insurance costs published annually by NHTSA. 

The mandatory text specified by part 582 relates to, among other topics, the limitations of the auto insurance cost
data as a predictor of differences in insurance premiums. Essentially, those limitations result from the fact that
most of the factors that insurance companies use to establish premiums relate to driver characteristics and, except
for the vehicle's value, are not directly related to the vehicle itself. Thus, as the text explains, the fact that a
vehicle's historical claims experience is somewhat better or worse than that of other vehicles in its class may not
be reflected in the premium that an insurance company establishes for that vehicle. If the claims experience is reflected,
it is likely to have only a small impact on the premium.

<DOCNO> FR940913-1-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940913-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The mandatory text also urges consumers to contact insurance companies if they wish to obtain precise information
about actual premiums for particular makes and models of vehicles. Previous studies by NHTSA have revealed that the
difference between the premiums charged by different insurance companies for the same car and driver is greater than
the difference between the premiums charged by a given company for comparably-valued cars that have different claims
experience. NHTSA believed the mandatory text would help to minimize consumer confusion by providing customers
with an understanding of the uses and limitations of the auto insurance cost data. 
In specifying the yearly insurance cost data that accompanied the required text, NHTSA decided to rely on collision
loss experience data collected and reported by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), as the best available indicator
of the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance costs. 
In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA specified HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report as the data source for part
582. NHTSA decided to specify HLDI's December Report because it contains more current data and covers more vehicle
models than other HLDI publications. The HLDI data is presented in a format that ranks the vehicles in each class from
best to worst (with numerical values given for each vehicle). NHTSA specified this format because it determined the
use of this ranking system should assist customers in evaluating the comparative performance of comparable vehicles.

In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA stated its belief that the HLDI information should be available as soon as possible
after its publication date. Therefore, NHTSA stated its intent to publish the annual 

Federal Register

 document updating HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report data no later than January of the calendar year that
follows HLDI's publication of the data. 


Proposed Amendments 


In this notice of proposed rulemaking, NHTSA proposes to amend part 582 by making certain changes in section 582.5,
that specifies the text of the insurance cost information booklet. At present, the text specifies the date ``January
[Year to be Inserted].'' In this NPRM, NHTSA proposes to revise ``January'' to ``March.'' The change to a later month
will allow NHTSA adequate time to publish the comparative insurance cost information booklet. HLDI sends the December
Insurance Collision Report data to NHTSA in mid-January. The data is then formatted for printing and distributed
to automobile dealers by mail. NHTSA can thus expect that the booklet will be published by March of each year. 
Part 582 presently specifies a comparison of insurance costs for ``passenger motor vehicles.'' In this NPRM, NHTSA
proposes to revise ``passenger motor vehicles,'' at appropriate places in  582.5, to read ``passenger cars,
utility vehicles, light duty trucks and vans.'' The proposed revisions would make clear that ``passenger motor vehicles''
includes many vehicle types besides ``passenger car.'' 
In this NPRM, NHTSA also proposes to make certain changes to the required text that would make more explicit the limitations
of the collision loss data. At present, the text in  582.5 explaining the data's limitations states that the
collision loss data table does not include information about new models, models that have been substantially redesigned,
and models without enough claim experience. In order to make clear that certain data should not be relied upon, NHTSA
proposes to revise the third paragraph in  582.5 to state:

 

The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED],
and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.

 

At present, the fourth paragraph in  582.5 states that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary
more than five percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle. Upon further review,
NHTSA believes it would be more accurate to state that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary more
than ten percent. This notice proposes that change. 
The reason for the change to ten percent is that the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) recommends insurance premium
rates to its members. An ISO representative indicated to NHTSA that the collision cost data could result in an insurance
premium reduction of ten percent rather than the five percent mentioned in the booklet ``Comparison of Differences
in Insurance Costs for Passenger Motor Vehicles on the Basis of Damage Susceptibility,'' made available to motor
vehicle purchasers.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, at present,  582.5 states that to determine the actual premium that a consumer will be charged for insuring
a particular vehicle or for complete information about insurance premiums, the consumer should contact insurance
companies directly. In this proposed rule, NHTSA proposes that  582.5 be revised to advise the consumer to contact
insurance company 

agents 

directly. Amending the text to advise the consumer to contact the insurance company agents directly, reflects the
fact that the consumer's first point of contact with insurance companies is the insurance company agent. 


Regulatory Impacts 



1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects of the proposed amendments are minimal,
so that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This NPRM proposes minor amendments to the insurance cost information
regulation, so that the information to be provided to potential motor vehicle purchasers is more accurate. Assuming
these proposals are adopted, any extra text that must be included in the information booklet would be minuscule. 


2. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this notice of proposed rulemaking
on small entities. NHTSA estimates there are about 24,000 dealers of new passenger motor vehicles. Many of the dealers
would be considered small entities, that may be affected by this proposed rule. However, NHTSA believes that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of these small dealers. The rationale
is that this rulemaking proposes minor editorial changes, resulting in a small amount of extra text in the insurance
cost information booklet. The potential cost increments associated with this proposed rule should have negligible
effects on the purchase price of new passenger motor vehicles. For these reasons, I certify that the proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


3. National Environmental Policy Act 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts
of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human
environment. 


4. Federalism 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12623,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 


5. Civil Justice Reform 


This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. Chapter 323_

Consumer Information

 of 49 U.S.C. does not provide for judicial review of rules issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32302. The Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 

et seq.

, provides generally for judicial review of final agency action, which in certain circumstances may include this
proposed rule. The Administrative Procedure Act does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or
other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. 


Procedures for Filing Comments 


NHTSA solicits public comments on the issues presented in this notice. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies
be submitted. 
All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21.) Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15 page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments
in a concise fashion. 
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR part 512. 
All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for this notice will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on this notice will be available for inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as
it becomes available for inspection in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons
continue to examine the docket for new material.

The information made available pursuant to  582.4 shall be presented in writing in the English language and
in not less than 10-point type. It shall be presented in the format set forth below, and shall include the complete explanatory
text and the updated data published annually by NHTSA. 


MARCH [YEAR TO BE INSERTED] 
COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, UTILITY VEHICLES, LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS, AND VANS ON
THE BASIS OF DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY


The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided the information in this booklet in compliance
with Federal law as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The booklet compares differences
in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks and vans on the
basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does not indicate a vehicle's relative safety. 
The following table contains the best available information regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance
premiums. It was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) in its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]


Insurance Collision Report, 

and reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the
United States in terms of the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE YEARS TO BE INSERTED].
NHTSA has not verified the data in this table. 
The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative terms, with 100 representing the average for
all passenger vehicles. Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher (worse)
than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average.
The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED],
and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience. 
Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust the ``base rate'' for the collision portion
of their insurance premiums, the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that your total premium
will vary more than ten percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle. 

If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company does not use the HLDI information, your premium
will not vary at all in relation to these rankings. 
In addition, different insurance companies often charge different premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore,
you should contact insurance company agents directly to determine the actual premium that you will be charged for
insuring a particular vehicle. 






Please Note

: In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle
itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver characteristics (such as age, gender, marital
status, and driving record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many miles are traveled, and how
the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact insurance
company agents directly.




Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of
different vehicles. However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury protection and medical payments
coverage if the insured vehicle has features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air bags and automatic
seat belts. 
Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness are available from NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP
test results demonstrate relative frontal crash protection in new vehicles. Information on vehicles that NHTSA
has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424-9393.

Regulatory History 


On April 19, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice 
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for Commercial Fishing 
Industry Vessels (55 FR 14924). In the NPRM, the Coast 
Guard proposed to regulate U.S. documented or state numbered 
uninspected fishing, fish processing, and fish tender 
vessels, including vessels engaged in the Aleutian Trade, to 
implement the provisions of the Commercial Fishing Industry 
Vessel Safety Act of 1988. Subsequent to the NPRM, Congress 
enacted the Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (ATA), significantly 
affecting the impact of the proposed regulations on vessels 
engaged in the Aleutian trade. The ATA provides for 
continued cargo service to remote communities in Alaska 
while ensuring increased safety standards for fish tender 
vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. As a result of the 
ATA, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of 
proposed rulemaking, (SNPRM), in the 

Federal Register

 on 
October 27, 1992 (57 FR 48670). 
In response to the SNPRM, the Coast Guard received over 
206 comments specifically opposing, and only 4 comments 
favoring, the proposed ATA regulations. In a second SNPRM, 
the Coast Guard is now proposing to increase the safety 
standards for these vessels consistent with the comments 
received to the first SNPRM and establish a separate subpart 
in 46 CFR Part 28 for vessels engaged in the Aleutian trade. 


Background and Purpose 




The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990. 

On November 16, 1990, the President signed Pub. L. 101-595, The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (``the ATA''). The
ATA 
applies only to fish tender vessels engaged in the 
transportation of cargo (including fishery related products) 
for hire to or from a place in Alaska west of 153
  West 
longitude and east of 172
  East longitude and only, if that 
place receives weekly common carrier service by water, to or 
from a place in the United States (except a place in 
Alaska). The ATA requires these fish tender vessels to meet 
new safety and manning standards over a specified period of 
time. Additional background information concerning the ATA 
and the Coast Guard's interpretation of the Act, may be 
found at page 48670 of the SNPRM published October 27, 1992. 


Discussion of Comments 


In response to the SNPRM of October 27, 1992, the Coast 
Guard received four comments supporting the ATA. They were 
from a common carrier, a ship yard, a naval architect and an 
interested party that did not identify its affiliation. 
Additionally, the Coast Guard received 206 comments opposing 
the ATA. These comments were from fishermen, fishing vessel 
companies, naval architects, shipyards, the State 
Legislature and Governor of Alaska, an insurance company, 
and the general public. 
The primary objections to the proposed requirements 
were: (1) The potential for severe economic hardship to the 
operators of ATA vessels, and the people and companies the 
vessels serve in the outlying areas; (2) the possibility 
that common carriers serving the Aleutian area would have a 
monopoly on seaborne commerce in this area and could 
significantly increases rates; and (3) the lack of need for 
additional regulations when considering the positive safety 
record of ATA vessels. Additionally, comments opposed the 
proposed rules by arguing that: (1) The Coast Guard greatly 
underestimated the cost of compliance; (2) the Commercial 
Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act states that the Coast 
Guard cannot require alterations to existing vessels; and 
(3) the standards proposed are excessive and greater than 
those required of an inspected cargo vessel. 


Discussion of Proposed Rules 


In response to the large number of comments opposing 
the first SNPRM, the Coast Guard will revise its proposed 
regulations and issue a second SNPRM. The Coast Guard 
believes this SNPRM proposes standards that would upgrade 
safety requirements aboard ATA vessels and yet be responsive 
to the comments received to the first SNPRM. In this SNPRM, 
the Coast Guard is proposing a new subpart G, to be entitled 
Aleutian Trade Act Vessels. Each section is summarized in 
the following paragraphs. 


Subpart A_General Provisions 


Section 28.040 Incorporation by Reference 


This section lists the industry standards that are 
incorporated by reference and the corresponding sections 
where each standard is reference as the governing 
requirement. 
In the interest of keeping the regulations as 
uncomplicated as possible, the number of standards 
incorporated by reference has been minimized. 
National Fire Protection Association, NFPA, sections 
310-13 and 310-15 of NFPA 70 is referenced in  28.865. 
Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE, section J1475 is 
needed for compliance in  28.880. 
Underwriters Laboratories, UL, standard 217-1985, 
``Single and Multiple Station Smoke Detectors'' to supplement 
the information in  28.830 


Subpart G_Aleutian Trade Act Vessels 


Section 28.800 Applicability and General Requirements


This section describes the revised applicability for 
ATA vessels proposed for this subpart. Fish tender vessels 
engaged in the Aleutian trade are subject to inspection 
under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), or (7) 
except those that: 
1. Are not more than 500 gross tons; 
2. Have an incline test performed by a marine surveyor; and 
3. Have written stability instructions posted on board the 
vessel. 


Section 28.805 Launching of Survival Craft


This section would require ATA vessels to comply with 
46 CFR subpart B, which requires inflatable liferafts (SOLAS 
A Packs) for 100% complement coverage. To facilitate the 
manual launching of survival craft which have a mass of more 
than 110 pounds, (50 kg), each vessel must have a gate or 
another opening in its bulwarks, deck rails, or lifelines. 


Section 28.810 Deck Rails, Lifelines, Storm Rails and Hand Grabs


This section would adopt the same requirements of 
subpart D, which are essentially identical to those found in 
subchapter I. 


Section 28.815 Bilge Pumps, Bilge Piping, and Dewatering Systems


This section would require two power bilge pumps, each 
with a separate source of power (e.g. one electric pump and 
one mechanically driven or power take-off (PTO) pump) 
connected to a fixed system. However, a portable powered 
pump could substitute for one of the required pumps as long 
as it meets specific criteria as promulgated in these 
regulations. In contrast, subpart D requires one powered 
bilge pump connected to a fixed system while subchapter I 
requires three powered pumps for cargo vessels. 


Section 28.820 Fire Pumps, Fire Mains, Fire Hydrants, and Fire Hoses


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940913-1-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940913-1-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This section would require one power driven fire pump, 
connected to fixed piping, capable of delivering water at a 
minimum of 50 gallons per minute. In addition, a portable 
pump must be carried that has a capacity of 9500 gallons per 
hour and is capable of being connected to the firemain and 
hoses. However, if the vessel already has a portable pump 
satisfying the second bilge pump requirement, no additional 
portable pump would be required as long as it is properly 
equipped to handle both firefighting and flood control. 



Section 28.825 Excess Fire Detection and Protection Equipment 



This section would cover excess fire detection and 
protection equipment and is in lieu of  28.155. 



Section 28.830 Fire Detection System



This section would grandfather existing systems and 
equipment within specific limits and regulations, and 
provides acceptance latitude. It would require that 
accommodation spaces to be fitted with modular smoke 
detectors, and require manual remote shutdown of certain 
machinery outside of certain spaces. 



Section 28.835 Fuel Systems 



This section would incorporate applicable regulations 
of subchapter F for any replacement and or alteration to the 
existing grandfathered piping. It would also add the 
requirement for remote shutoff valves on certain fuel tanks, 
metal shields under filters, and limits the length of 
nonmetallic flexible hose used (for vibration purposes 
only). 

 




Note: 

Some of the piping aboard ex-Navy yard oilers 
used in the Aleutian trade was built and installed to Navy 
specifications and was encased in cement ballast. This 
arrangement would be grandfathered. In contrast, subpart D 
requires all fuel lines to be constructed of seamless 
material only, except short lengths of flex hose for 
vibration. Cargo vessels have the same requirements and, 
additionally, all valves and fittings must meet specific 
regulations of subchapter F. 



Section 28.840 Means for Stopping Pumps, Ventilation, and 
Machinery 



This section would contain requirements for remote 
controls similar to those applicable to cargo vessels. 



Section 28.845 General Requirements for Electrical Systems 



This section would adopt nearly all of the requirements 
of subpart D which provide for acceptance of recognized 
standards such as Underwriters Laboratory (UL). An added 
grandfathering clause would allow acceptance of existing 
materials and installations, on a case by case basis. For 
example, existing cables and wiring runs could be allowed to 
remain as presently constructed and routed. However, any 
replacement wiring or new installations would have to meet 
specific requirements. In comparison, the installation of 
all electrical systems and interior communications as to 
design, construction, and material acceptance for cargo 
vessels must be done in accordance with subchapter J. 



Section 28.850 Main Source of Electrical Power 



This section proposes general requirements for 
electrical systems that are presently found on ATA vessels.

Section 28.855 Electrical Distribution Systems 


This section requires that a distribution system which 
has neutral bus or conductor have the neutral bus or 
conductor grounded. It also requires a grounded 
distribution system to have only one connection to ground. 
The one connection to ground must be at the switchboard, or 
on a nonmetallic vessel at the common ground point. 


Section 28.860 Overcurrent Protection and Switched Circuits 


This section would require the same standards found in 
subpart D, which are similar to the requirements for 
inspected vessels contained in 46 CFR subchapter J_
Electrical Engineering Regulations. 


Section 28.865 Wiring Methods and Materials 


This section would require the same standards for wires 
and conductors found in subpart D. 


Section 28.870 Emergency Source of Electrical Power 


This section would require an emergency source of 
electrical power which is capable of supplying connected 
loads for at least 3 hours and which is physically separated 
from the main machinery space. This segregation would help 
ensure that one casualty did not disable all sources of 
electrical power. If the source is a battery, specific 
regulations would have to be satisfied. Note: No emergency 
generator is required_it is believed the combination of a 
duty engineer and back-up fire & bilge pumps as well as 
additional powered portable pump should be sufficient. 
Subpart D requires an independent source of electrical power 
located outside the machinery space capable of supplying all 
loads listed above plus the steering gear, and fire & bilge 
pumps continuously for 3 hours. Cargo vessels require 
emergency lighting for 6 hours. 


Section 28.875 Radar, Depth Sounding, and Auto-pilot 


This section would adopt the equipment requirements of 
subpart D for radar and depth sounding devices. In 
addition, procedures would be proposed for the use of an 
auto-pilot. 


Section 28.880 Hydraulic Equipment 


This section would grandfather some existing hydraulic 
hose runs and materials. It provides specifics for fluid, 
hose, fittings, and compatibility for use. It adds the 
requirement for fail-safe system components and provides 
requirements that enhance operator safety. It reduces 
existing overuse of nonmetallic hydraulic flex hose by 
limiting its use in runs where flexibility is not 
specifically required. However, any retrofit of hydraulic 
hoses would have to be accomplished over a period of time, 
such as replacing the flex hose with hard piping only 
whenever renewals, replacements or alterations are being 
accomplished. In comparison, subpart D specifically limits 
the allowable length of nonmetallic flexible hose to 30
'
' 
while subchapter I requires specific material approval in 
applicable sections of subchapter F. 


Section 28.885 Cargo Gear 


This section would take the cargo equipment found 
presently on these vessels and incorporate them with 
subchapter I requirements.

Section 28.890 Examination and Certification of Compliance 



This section would require that each ATA vessel be 
examined for compliance once every two years. The 
examination would be performed by the American Bureau of 
Shipping (ABS), a similarly qualified organization, or 
another accepted organization. The organization performing 
the examination would be required to provide the owner and 
the cognizant Coast Guard District Commander, (Attention: 
Fishing Vessel Safety Coordinator) with a copy of the signed 
certification letter if the vessel was found to be in 
compliance. A copy of a certification letter would also be 
required to be maintained on board the vessel. 
With respect to the inspection provisions, 46 U.S.C. 3302(c) 
was amended by exempting fishing, fish processing, and fish 
tender vessels of not more than 500 gross tons from 
consideration as a freight vessel, a seagoing barge, or a 
seagoing motor vessel under 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), and (7) 
if, when the vessel transports cargo to or from Alaska, that 
place does not receive weekly common carrier service by 
water from a place in the United States; or the cargo is of 
a type not accepted by that common carrier service; or in 
the case of a fish tender vessel, the vessel is not engaged 
in the Aleutian trade. 

A fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade is 
not subject to inspection under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 
3301 (1), (6), and (7), if the vessel is not more than 500 
gross tons, has an incline test performed by a marine 
surveyor, and has written stability instructions posted on 
board. These provisions were effective May 16, 1991. 



Section 28.895 Survey and Classification 



This proposed section would require each ATA vessel 
which undergoes a major conversion completed after July 27, 
1990, to be classed by the ABS or another organization 
determined by the Commandant to be similarly qualified. 



Section 28.900 Loadlines 



This section would require that a fish tender vessel of 
not more than 500 gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade, 
obtain a loadline certificate. 



Section 28.905 Post Accident Inspection 



This proposed section was suggested by a common carrier 
during the first SNPRM to require that an ATA vessel undergo 
a general or partial survey by a Coast Guard Representative 
following an accident or if a defect is discovered which 
affects the safety of the vessel. This requirement would be 
similar to that found in subchapter I for cargo vessels, 
however a third party would be conducting this post accident 
inspection. 



Section 28.910 Repairs and Alterations 



This proposed section, again suggested during the first 
SNPRM, would require the managing operators of an ATA vessel 
to notify a Coast Guard Representative prior to making 
repairs or alterations to an ATA vessel that may affect the 
safety of the vessel. 



Section 28.915 Manning and Crew 



This proposed section would establish manning 
requirements for a fish tender vessel of not more than 500 
gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade. 

This section also proposes that machinery spaces be 
under the control, when at sea, of an engineer designated as 
in charge. This designation may be: (a) In writing by the 
owner, operator, or master; (b) by an entry in the ship's 
log if one is maintained; or (c) by a designation on the 
emergency instructions required under  28.265. If 
designated engineers are not part of the vessel's 
complement, then all the requirements of subpart D would 
have to be met in addition to this subpart. Any component 
or system on a vessel found to be in conflict between the 
regulations found in subparts D and G, then the higher 
standard will apply. ATA amended 46 U.S.C. 8702 to require 
that a fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade 
comply with the crew requirements set out in  8702, but 
allowed the percentage of the deck crew, who are required to 
have merchant mariners documents endorsed for a rating of at 
least able seaman, to be reduced from 65 to 50 percent of 
crew size. These provisions were effective November 16, 
1991. 

Lastly, the ATA amended 46 U.S.C. Chapter 73 to allow 
acceptance of service on an ATA vessel to be used by an 
individual to qualify for an endorsement as an ``able 
seaman_fishing industry'', ``able seaman_unlimited'' or 
``able seaman_special.'' If the service is on board a 
vessel of at least 100 gross tons, the service may be 
accepted to qualify as an ``able seaman_limited''.

Additional material would be incorporated by reference 
and listed in 46 CFR 28.040: National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA 70-1987), sections 310-13 and 310-15 would 
be incorporated in  28.865; Society of Automotive Engineers, 
SAE, section J1475 would be incorporated in  28.880; and 
Underwriters Laboratories, UL, standard 217-1985, ``Single 
and Multiple Station Smoke Detectors'' would be incorporated 
in  28.830. Copies of this material will be available for 
inspection where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

, and from the 
sources listed in  28.040. 
Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will 
submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register 
for approval of the incorporation by reference. 


Regulatory Evaluation 


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action 
under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not 
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under 
section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by 
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is 
not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures 
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; 
February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic 
impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full 
Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory 
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 
The Coast Guard estimates that only 20 vessels out of 
an estimated U.S. commercial fishing fleet in excess of 
120,000 vessels would be affected by this rule. This 
proposed rule includes a number of grandfathered provisions. 
Therefore, the Coast Guard believes that existing equipment 
onboard these 20 vessels should be upgraded and replaced 
only when the existing equipment is no longer serviceable. 


Small Entities 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et 
seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, 
if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may 
include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit 
organizations that are independently owned and operated and 
are not dominant in their fields; and (2) governmental 
jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. 
An estimated 20 commercial fishing industry vessels are 
involved in the Aleutian Trade Act. A number of these 
vessels are owned or operated by small entities. However, 
the Coast Guard estimates that the cost of complying with 
these revised proposed regulations will be minor. Because 
it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the 
Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this 
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. If 
however, you think that your business qualifies as a small 
entity and that this proposal will have a significant 
economic impact on your business, please submit a comment 
(see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think your business 
qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal 
will economically affect your business.

Collection of Information


This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment. This notice proposes regulations for ATA vessels only. Since this rule affects specific
vessels both inside and outside state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same
subject matter.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
These proposed rules are to enhance certain safety equipment requirements and general operating procedures of ATA
vessels and have no significant effect on the environment. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

.
