<DOCTITLE>Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Office Complex at Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's
County, MD</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has prepared
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for construction of a 350,000 square foot, low-rise office complex
plus associated parking on federal land within the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's County,
Maryland. The project provides for consolidation of USDA functions currently located in leased facilities in Maryland
and the District of Columbia, and in the USDA Headquarters South Building, which will be renovated. Since initiating
the EIS process with a public scoping meeting in January, 1994, the size of the proposed office complex has been decreased
by USDA from 700,000 s.f. to 350,000 s.f.

The Draft EIS considers environmental impacts from project implementation on each of three (3) possible government-owned
sites: Site A, 100

#

 acres north of the Capital Beltway, southeast of the Rhode Island Avenue/Sunnyside Avenue intersection; Site B,
120

#

 acres east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, southeast of the Powdermill Road/Soil Conservation Service Road
intersection; and Site D, 94

#

 acres southeast of the Edmonston Road/Beaverdam Road intersection. A ``No Action'' alternative is also considered.
Potential environmental impacts include short-term construction-related impacts, and long-term changes in traffic,
socio-economic and physical conditions. The Draft EIS is available for inspection at the Beltsville, Greenbelt,
and College Park Public Libraries, and upon request from the USDA Headquarters at the address given below.

A Public Hearing on the Draft EIS will be held on October 27, 1994, at 7:00 p.m. in the auditorium of the Beltsville Agricultural
Research Center, Building 003, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, Maryland 20705. A short presentation by USDA
summarizing the Draft EIS will precede a period for public comments. Oral comments should be limited to ten (10) minutes
each. Agencies and the public are invited to provide written comments on the Draft EIS, in addition to, or in lieu of,
oral comments at the Public Hearing. All written comments must be mailed, no later than October 27, 1994 to: Mr. Michael
V. Sazonov, Contracting Office Technical Representative, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Operations,
Washington Area Service Center, South Building, Room S-313, 14th and Independence Avenue SW., Washington,

Finding of No Significant Impact for Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure RC&D Measure Horry County,
South Carolina 



Introduction 



The Burgess Community Flood Prevention RC&D Measure is a federally assisted action authorized for planning
under Public Law 97-98, Agriculture and Food Act of 1981. An environmental assessment was undertaken in conjunction
with the development of the plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation with local, State, and Federal agencies
as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed during the assessment are available for
public review at the following location:

 


U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1202 1st Avenue, Conway, South Carolina 29526 



Recommended Action 



Proposed is the construction of the Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure consisting of four miles of new and/or
renovated channels in order to properly remove the stormwater from the residential areas of the watershed. The proposed
measure plan will reduce flooding around 113 homes and reduce flooding of roads. 



Effect of Recommended Action 



The proposed action will protect the private and public improvements within the watershed by improving the removal
of excess stormwater. The channels which will be constructed or modified will be designed to remove the 10 year frequency
storm event. Streamflow will be stabilized to the extent that peak flood flow rates will be slightly reduced and flow
will be attenuated. 

The project will impact 0.76 acres of wetlands. The channels depths will be designed from 0.0 feet to a maximum depth
of 5.0 feet. This design will permit out of bank flow while minimizing any hydrological change to the surrounding wetlands.
All spoil and debris will be removed from the wetlands. 

There will be a land use change of approximately 15 acres. These changes are a result of land clearing to accommodate
easements and channel location. The change is from forested to open vegetated maintenance road adjacent to the channel.
A vegetated plan will be developed by the SCS biologist in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. 

The proposed project will improve quality of life and improve the health of the community. The removal of ponded stormwater
will allow the septic systems to work more effectively, improving the surface and groundwater quality. 

An initial management survey of cultural resources concluded that no significant adverse impacts will occur to cultural
resources in the project area. SCS archaeologist will conduct a complete survey of the project area prior to the commencement
of any project component. 

Threatened and endangered plant species have been identified in the project area in recent history but will not be
impacted by the proposed project. SCS in consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the proposed
project as planned will not adversely affect federally listed or proposed endangered and threatened species in Phase
I. Field investigations have not revealed any endangered species in Phase II or III due to other habitat changes. 

Fish and wildlife habitats will be temporarily disturbed during the installation of the project. The project will
provide long-term benefits by providing diversity in landuse by creating open space, wildlife plantings, and improved
water quality.

No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installations, with the exception of minor inconveniences
to local residents during construction.



Alternatives



The measure plan consisted of three alternatives, the no action plan, construction of 4 miles of channels, and the
removal of all residents from the flood area. Alternative 2, the construction and modification of the channels, was
chosen as the best economical and cost effective solution. Alternative No. 2 has been modified three times to avoid
possible endangered species habitat and wetlands at the request of those agencies involved in the comment processes.



Consultation_Public Participation



Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for
Federal Assistance in April 1992. Agencies were again notified when planning was authorized in August 1992.

Scoping meetings were conducted with SCS staff and included representatives from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, South Carolina Department
of Health and Environmental Control, and South Carolina Coastal Council. Meetings were held during April 1992, September
1992, June 1993, and September 1993. Planning involved all agencies identified and included county government and
landowners within the project area.

Specific consultation was conducted with the state Historic Preservation officer and residents within the watershed
as to cultural and historical resources.

The measure plan was transmitted to all participating and interested agencies, groups, and individuals for review
and comments in January 1994. Public meeting with landowners and sponsors were held throughout the planning process
to keep all interested parties informed of the study progress and to obtain public input to the measure plan and environmental
evaluation.


Agency consultation and public participation to date has shown no unresolved conflicts with the implementation
of the selected plan.



Conclusion



The Environmental Assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local,
regional, or national impacts on the environment. Therefore based on the above findings, I have determined that an
environmental impact statement for the Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure is not required.

For your information the Borrower is currently considering the following terms:

(1) 

Amount:

 U.S. $10 million.

(2) 

Term: 

30 years.

(3) 

Grace Period: 

Ten years grace on repayment of principal (during grace period, semi-annual payments of interest only). If 

variable

 interest rate, repayment of principal to amortize in equal, semi-annual installments over the remaining 20-year
life of the loan. If 

fixed

 interest rate, semi-annual level payments of principal and interest over the remaining 20-year life of the loan.

(4) 

Interest Rate: 

Alternatives of both fixed and variable rate loans are requested.

(a) 

Variable Interest Rate: 

To be based on the three-month or six-month British Bankers Association LIBOR, preferably with terms relating to
Borrower's right to convert to fixed. The rate should be adjusted weekly.

(b) 

Fixed Interest Rate: 

If rates are to be quoted on a spread over an index, the lender should use as its index a long bond, specifically the 71/2%
U.S. Treasury bond due November 15, 2024. Such rate is to be set at the time of acceptance.

(5) 

Prepayment: 

(a) Offers should include any options for prepayment and mention prepayment premiums, if any.

(b) Federal statutes governing the activities of the USAID Housing Guaranty program require that the proceeds of
USAID-guaranteed loans be used to provide affordable shelter and related infrastructure and services to below median-income
families. In the extraordinary event that the Borrower materially breaches its obligation to comply with this, or
related, requirements, USAID reserves the right, among its other rights and remedies, to accelerate the loan. (It
should be noted that since the inception of the USAID Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID has not exercised its
right of acceleration).

(6) 

Fees: 

Please note that Lenders' placement fees (if any), legal fees, and out-of-pocket expenses are to be 

included

 in the rate quoted for this financing (i.e., such fees will not be deductible from the proceeds of the loan). The initial
up front fees of USAID and the Paying and Transfer Agent shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. In
the event of bidding through the Financial Advisor, the Investor is required to arrange with the Financial Advisor
regarding the fees to be paid, which are also to be included in the interest rate to be quoted.

(7) 

Closing Date: 

Not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender.

Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion
of the Borrower, and thereafter, subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements
between USAID and the Borrower.

The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in Section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, as amended (the ``Act'').

Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in Section 238(c) of the Act. They are: (1) U.S.
citizens; (2) domestic U.S. corporations, partnerships, or associations substantially beneficially owned by
U.S. citizens; (3) foreign corporations whose share capital is at least 95 percent owned by U.S. citizens; and, (4)
foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens.

To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of
the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established
from time to time by USAID.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Certificate of Interim Extension of the Term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306; Dynabac</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Interim Patent Term Extension.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office has issued a certificate under 35 U.S.C. Section 156(d)(5) for a one-year interim
extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306 that claims the human drug product known as Dynabac.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.



On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103-179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.

On August 22, 1994, Eli Lilly and Company, on behalf of the patent owner Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, filed an application
under 35 U.S.C. section 156(d)(5) for interim extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306. The application
states that the patent claims the active ingredient Dirithromycin in the human drug product Dynabac and a method of
using the product under regulatory review. The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing a
regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market or use the product commercially.
The original term of the patent is set to expire on September 13, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the
term of the patent for a period of one year.

Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. section 156. Since it is apparent that the
regulatory review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the
patent term under 35 U.S.C. section 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C.
section 156(d)(5) of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306 has been granted for a period of one year from the original
expiration date of the patent.

Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




The Governments of the United States and the Lao People's Democratic Republic reached agreement, effected by exchange
of notes dated November 8, 1993, to establish an export visa arrangement for certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber,
silk-blend and non-cotton vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in the Lao People's

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the
Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on
December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Visa Arrangement of November 8, 1993, between the Governments of the United States
and the Lao People's Democratic Republic; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March
3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on October 1, 1994, entry into the Customs territory of
the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption
and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk-blend, and non-cotton vegetable
fiber textiles and textile products in Categories 200-239, 300-369, 400-469, 600-670, and 800-899, including merged
and part categories, produced or manufactured in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and exported from the Lao People's
Democratic Republic on and after October 1, 1994 for which the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic
has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below. Should additional categories, merged categories
or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included
in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period October 1, 1994 through
October 15, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa.

A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking
in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.

Each visa stamp shall include the following information:
 
1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical
digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for the Lao People's Democratic Republic is ``LA''), and a six digit
numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 4LA123456.

2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.

3. The signature and the printed name of the issuing official.

4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment
as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation (e.g., ``Cat. 340-510 DOZ'').

Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').

U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
printed name of signer, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been
crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall
not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and
only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota.

The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.

If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic,
or a visa waiver may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Lao People's Democratic
Republic, and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver,
if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. 
If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from Laos has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an
incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to
the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.

Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.

A facsimile of the visa stamp is enclosed with this letter.

The actions taken concerning the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic with respect to imports of textiles
and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the
Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs
exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for Howard Hanson Dam Operating, King County, WA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Seattle District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Continuing
Operation and Maintenance of the Howard Hanson Dam on the Green River, King County, Washington. Even though this project
was completed before the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, it is the intent of the Corps to prepare an EIS on
current operations which have an impact on notable environmental amenities, particularly, resident and anadromous
fish resources.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Howard A. Hanson Dam was originally authorized as the Eagle Gorge Dam and Reservoir by the Flood Control Act of 1950.
Construction was completed in 1962. Project authorized purposes were flood control, augmentation of low flows,
irrigation and water supply. Irrigation in the Green River Valley is no longer a priority and the project has never
been operated for water supply. Howard Hanson Dam has arrange of operational choices within the parameters of the
authorized uses of the project. Throughout the years that HHD has been in operation, many downstream changes have
occurred in land use, recreation, k fishery resources and resource allocation as well as in general environmental
awareness. These, in turn, have resulted in operational changes and adjustments primarily related to refilling
the conservation pool and controlling sediment accumulation in the reservoir. Seattle District proposes to operate
the project for flood control and low flow augmentation in accordance with a refill strategy instituted in 1992, a
drought year. In coordination with resource agencies, refill will begin early (April) and discharge flows are designed
to minimize impacts to wild steelhead spawning downstream. This strategy is dynamic and adjustments will be made
on a year-to-year basis as new knowledge is gained.


Alternatives


The Corps of Engineers has three alternative courses of action available:
1. Operate the project as described above (the ``no action'' alternative because it is the existing condition.
2. Operate with the original parameters generally used from 1962 to 1983.
3. Operate with 98% reliability with delay of refill for out-migration of upper watershed fish_a strategy generally
used from 1984 to 1992.


Scoping and Public Involvement


Public involvement will be sought during scoping and conduct of the study in accordance with NEPA procedures. A public
scoping process has been begun to clarify issues of major concern, identify any information sources that might be
available to analyze and evaluate impacts, and obtain public input on the range and acceptability of alternatives.
The Notice of Intent formally commences the scoping process under NEPA. As part of the scoping process, all affected
Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Tribes, and other interested private organizations, including environmental
groups, are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. Comments are requested concerning project alternatives, mitigation
measures, probable significant environmental impacts and permits or other approvals that may be required.
The following key areas have been identified to be analyzed in depth in the draft EIS:



1. Geology and Engineering Design.
2. Water Management.
3. Water Quality.
4. Fisheries.
5. Wildlife.
6. Wetlands.
7. Cultural Resources.
8. Socioeconomic Resources.


Other Environmental Review and Coordination Requirements


All review and coordination requirements will be fulfilled via this NEPA process. On-going operations of the dam
are continually coordinated with agencies and interested publics.


Scoping Meeting


A scoping meeting is not scheduled for this EIS.


Availability of Draft EIS


The draft EIS is scheduled for release in the spring of 1995.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE). 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Information Collection. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This information collection will be used to explore two methodological issues: whether survey methods show that
nonuse values exist for nonenvironmental goods (e.g., consumer willingness to pay to prevent the job losses of others);
and a comparison between alternative survey instruments. See Supplementary Information. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) is funding a methodological study on nonuse values. A nonuse value is a measure of people's
willingness to pay to preserve the mere existence of something even though they never plan to own, use, or directly
benefit from it. The first portion of the study addreses whether such values exist for nonenvironmental services,
such as jobs of others outside one's community. In the second portion of the study, willingness-to-pay for single
items considered individually will be compared to willingness-to-pay for the same items when bundled. These methodological
questions will be evaluated in a trade-off context, with the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest as the subject
of the study. 



This study is being performed solely to address methodological issues surrounding the estimation of nonuse values
and will not be used for any other purpose. In particular, DOE seeks to ascertain whether individuals who state positive
nonuse values for 

environmental 

services also state positive nonuse values for 

nonenvironmental 

services and how different survey methods perform to elicit willingness-to-pay valuations. 

The method used here will be a paper-and-pencil survey administered in a shopping mall in or near Raleigh, North Carolina.
Recruiters will approach shoppers and ask if they are willing to take the survey. It will take approximately one-half
hour for each of the anticipated 200 respondents to complete the questionnaire, for a total information collection
burden of 100 hours. 

DOE recognizes that the use of the mall-intercept approach which is necessitated by the Department's limited resources
for this research entails statistical problems that render problematic any extrapolation of survey results to a
population or subpopulation other than the actual individuals sampled. Thus, the results of this survey will be used
solely to guide future research and advance the development of methods for estimating nonuse values, and will not
be used for policy purposes related to any rulemaking, natural resource damage assessment, or other substantive
government program. DOE believes that the practical utility of this research justifies the small burdens it imposes
on respondents.

In the Matter of: Evcon Industries, Inc. (Case No. F-072)



Background


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart
B.

The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

Evcon filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated May 11, 1994, in accordance with section 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. The
Department published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 14, 1994, Evcon's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 35916.
Evcon also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on July 9, 1994.
59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994.

No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Evcon Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Evcon.



Assertions and Determinations



Evcon's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Evcon requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces. Evcon states that since the 30-second delay
is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in a 1.0 to 2.0 percent improvement
in overall energy efficiency, the petition should be granted.

Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Evcon indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces.

Since the blower controls incorporated on the Evcon furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in every
instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees
that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the Evcon AGU, BGU, and BGD series
gas furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces, today's Decision and
Order exempts Evcon from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 30-second
delay.




It is, therefore, ordered that:




(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Evcon Industries, Inc. (Case No. F-072) is hereby granted as set forth
in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 

(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Evcon Industries, Inc., shall
be permitted to test its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part
430, with modifications set forth below: 

(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 
3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section
9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 
(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Evcon Industries, Inc. shall comply in all respects
with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 
(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces manufactured by Evcon Industries, Inc. 
(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 
(5) Effective September 7, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Evcon Industries, Inc. on
July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994 (Case No. F-072).

Assertions and Determinations



York's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. York requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces. York states that since the
30-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an approximately
0.5 percent improvement in energy efficiency, the petition should be granted. 

Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. York indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces. 

Since the blower controls incorporated on the York furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in every
instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees
that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the York P2DP, PBKD, and XED02
lines of induced draft furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft
furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts York from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows
testing with the 30-second delay. 




It is, therefore, ordered that:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section
9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, York International Corporation shall comply in all
respects with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 

(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the P2DP, PBKD, and XED02 lines of induced draft furnaces manufactured by York International Corporation.


(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 

(5) Effective September 7, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the York International Corporation
on July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35918, July 14, 1994 (Case No. F-073).

<DOCTITLE>Transwestern Pipeline Co., et al., Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



September 6, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission:



1. Transwestern Pipeline Company



[Docket No. CP94-751-000] 



Take notice that on August 30, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), Post Office Box 1188, Houston,
Texas 77251-1188 filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order granting permission
and approval to abandon certain facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection. 
Transwestern states that while preparing for further proceedings in its refunctionalization proceeding in Docket
No. CP94-254-000, and upon further analysis of its system in response to the gathering orders recently
issued by the Commission, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including certain compressors, plants,
meters, dehydrators, and other miscellaneous wellhead facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical
or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. It is stated that this abandonment requests authorization
to abandon certain compression, plants, metering, dehydration, and other miscellaneous facilities, and to secure
all other authorizations as may be required under the circumstances. 

Transwestern states that it is proposing to abandon a number of compressors because the wells upstream have been plugged
and abandoned by the producer and deliveries of gas have ceased. It is stated that other compression facilities will
be abandoned because the wellhead pressure has fallen below the level necessary for the gas to enter Transwestern's
facilities or gas can no longer enter Transwestern's system because the producer disconnected the well. In certain
instances, Transwestern contends that the well has been split connected or disconnected because the producer has
opted to transport the gas through another pipeline with a lower pressure line. Transwestern submits that abandonment
of other compressors is requested because the volumes of gas from the wells behind the compressors have fallen to below
the minimum level required for operation of the compressors. 

According to Transwestern, abandonment of some of the compressors is requested because the facilities are no longer
needed for one of the following reasons: (i) The gathering system behind the compressor was sold and there are no volumes
flowing into the Transwestern system; (ii) the producer decided to provide its own compression; (iii) an exchange
arrangement with another pipeline was terminated, and compression is no longer required or necessary; (iv) Transwestern's
line pressure was lowered to the point that compression is no longer required; or (v) at stations where there are multiple
units, the volume decreased to the point that one or more such units are not required. 

Transwestern also proposes to abandon six plants, three because the producers have chosen to install their own treating
facilities for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, and therefore, the plants are no longer necessary. 

For the remaining three plants, Transwestern states that one will be abandoned because the wells requiring hydrogen
sulfide removal have been plugged and abandoned, one will be abandoned because the production behind the plant no
longer consists of sour gas requiring hydrogen sulfide removal, and the third will be abandoned its operation is no
longer economically feasible due to a substantial decrease of volumes flowing through the plant. 

Transwestern states that it also proposes to abandon meters, dehydrators, and associated facilities because no
gas has flowed through the subject facilities since 1990, and it is quite certain that no gas will flow through the facilities
in the future.

September 2, 1994.


Take notice that on August 31, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), tendered for filing a Fuel Reimbursement
Charge Adjustment Report pursuant to Section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised
Volume No. 1.

FGT states that the ratio of fuel usage and unaccounted for volumes to actual deliveries determined in accordance
with Section 27 of its tariff and reflected on an attached workpaper is 2.31%. Because this percentage supports the
currently effective Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage of 2.25% requested in FGT's out-of-cycle filing on May
11, 1994, in Docket No. TM94-5-34 and approved by Commission order issued June 17, 1994, and because changes
in the Percentage must be reflected in all Shippers' arrangements with suppliers and upstream transporters and/or
gatherers, FGT is not proposing any revisions at this time. Therefore, no tariff sheets are filed with the report.
FGT further states it will continue to closely monitor the actual quantities of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas
as information becomes available and make such adjustments to the Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage as warranted
in accordance with Section 27 in order to closely match the fuel retention with actual operating experience and minimize
the over or under retention of company used fuel and unaccounted for volumes.
FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the
filing and the interested state commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September
13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

Sewer Overflow (CSO) Management Award Nominations Under EPA's Environmental Excellence Awards Program (EPA ICR
No. 1287.04; OMB Control No. 2040-0101).


Abstract:

 This ICR is an extension of an existing information collection request in support of the Environmental Excellence
Awards Program. Established under section 501(e) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the program
recognizes municipalities and industries that demonstrate outstanding technological achievements; or innovative
processes, methods or devices in their waste treatment and pollution abatement programs. The program provides a
positive incentive for compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system and supports sound
environmental management practices at water treatment facilities.
As part of the process for selection, candidates must complete and submit relevant questionnaires (Biosolids, CSO,
O&M, SW) requesting: (1) Identification information; (2) planning and process reports; (3) general plant design
and layout information; (4) flow/output data; and (5) financial and management information. 
The questionnaires are screened initially by the State or EPA Region, then forwarded through headquarters to the
EPA-sponsored National Panel (consisting of EPA, professional associations and States) for the awards selection.
A national awards ceremony is held each fall in Washington, DC to honor those facilities that are selected. 


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 14 hours per response including
an average of 8 hours per response for facility Owner/Operators reviewing instructions, gathering the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the questionnaire; and 6 hours per response for State agencies screening applicants,
and reviewing and forwarding questionnaires to the EPA. 


Respondents:

 Owners/operators of municipal or private wastewater treatment facilities, and State agencies involved in the awards
process, as appropriate. 


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 200 owners/operators and their respective State agencies, where appropriate.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 On occasion of submission of questionnaire.

<DOCTITLE>California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Waiver of Federal preemption; Decision </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice regarding waiver of Federal preemption. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is granting California a waiver of Federal Preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act to enforce
amendments to its motor vehicle emission standards and test procedures to require more stringent evaporative emission
standards, durability requirements, and testing procedures for 1995 model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks,
medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, except petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. California
also amended its corresponding regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 I have decided to grant California a waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as
amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), for amendments to its evaporative emission standards, durability requirements,
and test procedures for 1995 model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty
vehicles and engines.

1 

A comprehensive description of the California evaporative emission regulations can be found in the decision document
for this waiver and in materials submitted to the Docket by California. 




Section 209(b) of the Act provides that, if certain criteria are met, the Administrator shall waive Federal preemption
for California to enforce new motor vehicle emission standards and accompanying enforcement procedures. The criteria
include consideration of whether California arbitrarily and capriciously determined that its standards are, in
the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the applicable Federal standards; whether California
needs State standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; and whether California's amendments are
consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these standards and accompanying enforcement procedures
do not cause California's standards, in the aggregate, to be less protective of public health and welfare than the
applicable Federal standards. No information was presented to me by any parties to demonstrate that CARB arbitrarily
or capriciously reached this protectiveness determination. Therefore, I cannot find CARB's determination to be
arbitrary and capricious. 
CARB has continually demonstrated the existence of compelling and extraordinary conditions justifying the need
for its own motor vehicle emission control program, which includes the subject standards and procedures. No information
has been submitted to demonstrate that California no longer has a compelling and extraordinary need for its own program.
Therefore, I agree that California continues to have compelling and extraordinary conditions which require its
own program, and, thus, I cannot deny the waiver on the basis of the lack of compelling and extraordinary conditions.

CARB has submitted information that its emission standards and durability requirements are technologically feasible
and present no inconsistency with Federal requirements and are, therefore, consistent with section 202(a) of the
Act. Additionally, CARB determined that certain differences exist between California and Federal test procedures
but that any vehicle that satisfies California's requirements can be presumed to meet the Federal requirements.
Because of the test procedure inconsistencies described by CARB, EPA agrees that a manufacturer would be unable to
demonstrate compliance with both California and Federal requirements with the same test vehicle in the course of
a single test sequence. Therefore, EPA will accept the data used to successfully certify under CARB's 1995 model year
evaporative emissions test procedures as demonstrating compliance with applicable EPA standards. Accordingly,
I hereby grant the waiver requested by California. 
My decision will affect not only persons in California but also the manufacturers outside the State who must comply
with California's requirements in order to produce motor vehicles for sale in California. For this reason, I hereby
determine and find that this is a final action of national applicability. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may be sought only in the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitions for review must be filed by November 14, 1994. Under section
307(b)(2) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may not be obtained in subsequent enforcement proceedings.

As with past waiver decisions, this action is not a rule as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2).
Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this action
on small business entities.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for labeling of pesticide products used together or sequentially.
That policy has been developed in a draft Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Labeling Limitations for
Products Used Together or Sequentially'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request a copy
of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pesticide products may be mixed or used after other pesticides according to label directions. However, sometimes
products bear labeling statements which prohibit or advise against using certain products together or after each
other to prevent crop phytotoxicity, incompatibility, reduction of efficacy or adverse effects to humans or the
environment. The Agency is proposing guidance on when such labeling statements will be approved. The proposed policy
is that the Agency will require or approve mandatory labeling statements prohibiting or limiting use of one product
with or after another only if data are submitted which demonstrate that unreasonable adverse effects will occur without
such statements. If EPA is not persuaded by the data or no data are submitted, the Agency will approve advisory statements
which recommend that a product not be used with or after another. 


This 

Federal Register

 notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing
any comments, EPA determines that changes to the policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the draft PR Notice prior
to release.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Scientific Reassessment of Dioxin 



In April 1991, EPA announced that it would conduct a scientific reassessment of the health risks of exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo-

p

-dioxin (TCDD) and chemically similar compounds collectively known as dioxin. The EPA has undertaken this task in
response to emerging scientific knowledge of the biological, human health, and environmental effects of dioxin.
Significant advances have occurred in the scientific understanding of mechanisms of dioxin toxicity, of the carcinogenic
and other adverse health effects of dioxin in people, of the pathways to human exposure, and of the toxic effects of
dioxin to the environment. The reassessment is part of the Agency's goals to improve the research and science base
and to incorporate improved research and science into EPA decisions. 



History 



In 1985 and 1988, the Agency prepared assessments of the human health risks from environmental exposures to dioxin.
Also, in 1988, a draft exposure document was prepared that presented procedures for conducting site-specific exposure
assessments to dioxin-like compounds. These assessments were reviewed by the Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB).
At the time of the 1988 assessments, there was general agreement within the scientific community that there could
be a substantial improvement over the existing approach to analyzing dose response, but there was no consensus as
to a more biologically defensible methodology. The Agency was asked to explore the development of such a method. The
Agency's reassessment activities are in response to this request. 



Stages in the Reassessment Process That Have Been Completed 



The EPA had endeavored to make each phase of the reassessment of dioxin an open and participatory effort. On November
15, 1991, and April 28, 1992, public meetings were held to discuss the Agency's plans and activities for the reassessment,
to hear and receive public comments and reviews of the proposed plans, and to receive any current, scientifically
relevant information. 

In the Fall of 1992, the Agency convened two peer-review workshops to review draft documents related to EPA's scientific
reassessment of the health effects of dioxin. The first workshop was held September 10 and 11, 1992, to review a draft
exposure assessment titled, Estimating Exposures to Dioxin-Like Compounds. The second workshop was held September
22-25, 1992, to review eight chapters of a future draft Health Assessment Document for 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-

p

-dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds. Peer-reviewers were also asked to identify issues to be incorporated into
the risk characterization, which was under development. 

In the Fall of 1993, a third peer-review workshop was held on September 7 and 8, to review a draft of the revised and expanded
Epidemiology and Human Data Chapter, which also would be part of the future health assessment document. The revised
chapter provided an evaluation of the scientific quality and strength of the epidemiology data in the evaluation
of toxic health effects, both cancer and noncancer, from exposure to dioxin, with an emphasis on the specific congener,
2,3,7,8-TCDD. 

Prior to each workshop, the draft documents or chapters were made available in keeping with the Agency's continuing
commitment to conduct the reassessment of dioxin in an open and participatory manner, to keep the public informed
of its progress, and to encourage public participation in the document development process. The public also was invited
to attend the workshops, to present oral comments, and/or to submit written comments. At each workshop, a panel of
scientific experts from outside the Agency reviewed the draft documents and provided valuable comments. It also
should be noted that outside scientists have been heavily involved throughout the developmental process of writing
and reviewing these draft documents. With this notice, the External Review Drafts of both draft documents are being
released for a 120-day public review and comment period. 



Current Stage of the Scientific Reassessment of Dioxin 



The scientific reassessment of dioxin consists of five activities: 

 


1. Update and revision of the health assessment document for dioxin. 

2. Laboratory research in support of the dose-response model. 

3. Development of a biologically based dose-response model for dioxin. 

4. Update and revision of the dioxin exposure assessment document. 

5. Research to characterize ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems. 

 


The first four activities have resulted in two draft documents (the health assessment document and exposure document)
for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-

p

-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. These companion documents, which form the basis for the Agency's reassessment
of dioxin, have been used in the development of the risk characterization chapter that follows the health assessment
(Chapter 9, Volume III). The process for developing these documents consisted of three phases which are outlined
in later paragraphs. 

The fifth activity, which is in progress at EPA's Environmental Research Laboratory in Duluth, Minnesota, involves
characterizing ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems from exposure to dioxins. Research efforts are focused on
the study of organisms in aquatic food webs to identify the effects of dioxin exposure that are likely to result in significant
population impacts. A report titled, Interim Report on Data and Methods for the Assessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-

p

-Dioxin (TCDD) Risks to Aquatic Organisms and Associated Wildlife (EPA/600/R-93/055), was published in April
1993. This report will serve as a background document for assessing dioxin-related ecological risks. Ultimately,
these data will support the development of aquatic life criteria which will aid in the implementation of the Clean
Water Act. 

As mentioned previously, completion of the health assessment and exposure documents involves three phases: Phase
1 involved drafting state-of-the-science chapters and a dose-response model for the health assessment document,
expanding the exposure document to address dioxin related compounds, and conducting peer-review workshops by panels
of experts. This phase has been completed. 

Phase 2, preparation of the risk characterization, began during the September 1992 workshops with discussions by
the peer-review panels and formulation of points to be carried forward into the risk characterization. Following
the September 1993 workshop, this work was completed and was incorporated as Chapter 9 (Volume III) of the draft health
assessment document. This phase has been completed. 

Phase 3 is currently underway. It includes making External Review Drafts of both the health assessment document and
the exposure document available for public review and comment. 



Next Stages in the Reassessment Process 



As described previously, public briefings will be held during the first week of the public comment period to be followed
by formal public hearings in December 1994. After the close of the public comment period, the Agency's Science Advisory
Board (SAB) will review the draft documents in public session (early 1995). Following SAB review, the draft documents
will be revised, comments and revisions will be incorporated, and final documents will be issued.

Privacy Act of 1974; Notice of a Computer Matching Program 
 
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
 


 
 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a Computer Matching Program between HUD and the Small Business Administration (SBA). 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988, as amended, (Public Law 100-503), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the
Conduct of Matching Programs (54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989)), and OMB Bulletin 89-22, ``Instructions on Reporting
Computer Matching Programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public,'' the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to conduct a computer matching program
with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to utilize a computer information system of HUD, the Credit Alert Interactive
Voice Response System (CAIVRS), with SBA's debtor files. In addition to HUD data, the CAIVRS data base now includes
delinquent debt information from the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Veterans Affairs and the Small Business
Administration. This match will allow prescreening of applicants for loans or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government
to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or insured by the Federal Government for HUD or SBA
direct or guaranteed loans. 
 


Before granting a loan, the lending agency and/or the authorized lending institution will be able to interrogate
the CAIVRS debtor file which contains the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of HUD's delinquent debtors and defaulters
and defaulted debtor records of the SBA and verify that the loan applicant is not in default or delinquent on direct
or guaranteed loans of participating Federal programs of either agency. Authorized users place a telephone call
to the system. The system provides a recorded message followed by a series of instructions, one of which is a requirement
for the SSN of the loan applicant. The system then reports audibly whether the SSN is related to delinquent or defaulted
Federal obligations for HUD or SBA direct or guaranteed loans. As a result of the information produced by this match,
the authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision of any loan assistance to an applicant or take
other adverse action against such applicant, until an officer or employee of such agency has independently verified
such information.

Records to be matched: HUD will utilize its system of records entitled HUD/DEPT-2, 

Accounting Records. 

The debtor files for HUD programs involved are included in this system of records. HUD's debtor files contain information
on borrowers and co-borrowers who are currently in default (at least 90 days delinquent on their loans); or who have
any outstanding claims paid during the last three years on Title II insured or guaranteed home mortgage loans; or individuals
who have defaulted on Section 312 rehabilitation loans; or individuals who have had a claim paid in the last three years
on a Title I loan. For the CAIVRS match, HUD/DEPT-2, System of Records, receives its program inputs from HUD/DEPT-28,
Property Improvement and Manufactured (Mobile) Home Loans_Default; HUD/DEPT-32, Delinquent/Default/Assigned
Temporary Mortgage Assistance Payments (TMAP) Program; and HUD/CPD-1, Rehabilitation Loans-Delinquent/Default.
 The SBA will provide HUD with debtor files contained in its system of records entitled, Loan Case File (SBA 075). HUD
is maintaining SBA's records only as a ministerial action on behalf of SBA, not as a part of HUD's HUD/DEPT-2 system
of records. SBA's data contain information on individuals who have defaulted on their direct loans. The SBA will retain
ownership and responsibility for their systems of records that they place with HUD. HUD serves only as a record location
and routine use recipient for SBA's data.
Notice Procedures: HUD and the SBA will notify individuals at the time of application (ensuring that routine use appears
on the application form) for guaranteed or direct loans that their records will be matched to determine whether they
are delinquent or in default on a Federal debt. HUD and the SBA have published notices concerning routine use disclosures
in the 

Federal Register

 to inform individuals that a computer match may be performed to determine a loan applicant's credit status with the
Federal Government.
Categories of Records/Individuals Involved: The debtor records include these data elements: SSN, claim number,
program code, and indication of indebteness. Categories of records include: records of claims and defaults, repayment
agreements, credit reports, financial statements, and records of foreclosures. Categories of individuals include:
former mortgagors and purchasers of HUD-owned properties, manufactured (mobile) home and home improvement loan
debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans, and rehabilitation loan debtors who are delinquent or in default
on their loans.
Period of the Match: Matching will begin at least 40 days from the date copies of the signed (by both Data Integrity Boards)
computer matching agreement are sent to both Houses of Congress or at least 30 days from the date this Notice is published
in the 

Federal Register

, whichever is later, providing no comments are received which would result in a contrary determination.

Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Management Plan 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act of 1992, the Refuge Manager of the Rocky Mountain
Arsenal National Wildlife Area, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Department of Interior) gives notice of the agency's
intent to prepare an environmental impact statement on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive
Management Plan, Adams County, Colorado. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-402) established the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal as a National Wildlife Refuge following environmental cleanup, and provided authority for the
Fish and Wildlife Service to manage the area as if it were a National Wildlife Refuge during the cleanup process. Pursuant
to the Department of Interior's Departmental Manual implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, an Environmental
Impact Statement will be prepared for all master plans for major new installations of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The Plan will guide the development of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. Ray Rauch, Refuge Manager,
will be the responsible official. 



Federal, state and local agencies, individuals, or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the decision
regarding the Plan are invited to participate in the scoping process. Public involvement in the planning process
will be sought by 1) sending planning updates and requests for comments to agencies, organizations, and individuals,
and 2) holding open house/public comment forums in the Denver metropolitan area. Scoping meetings will be held on
September 12, 13, and 14. Locations and times for the scoping meetings will be announced in the local news media and
in a newsletter. The analysis is expected to take about 12 months. A draft environmental impact statement should be
available for public review and comment by May, 1995. 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of guidance
provided by several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. Reviewers
of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the
proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Judicial review
may waive or dismiss objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but
that were not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement.

Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions


Date: August 18, 1994.


Case No. 94-OFC-14


In the Matter of: United States Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Plaintiff v.
KRT Drywall/Acoustical, Defendant.




It appears that:
1. Plaintiff U.S. Department of Labor filed the complaint herein on July 13, 1994 pursuant to the expedited hearing
procedures set forth in 41 CFR 60-30.31 

et seq.

 A copy of the complaint is attached hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference.
2. The complaint and Plaintiff's Request for Admissions were served on Defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical by Federal
Express and were received by KRT on July 13, 1994.
3. KRT did not file an answer, nor has it requested an extension of time within which to file an answer.
4. On August 9, 1994 Plaintiff filed a ``Motion for Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions'' on the grounds that Defendant
failed to file an answer or request an extension of time within 20 days after service of the complaint as required by
41 CFR 60-30.6(a).
5. On August 10, 1994 Defendant filed an ``Objection to Plaintiff's Motion For a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions''
requesting a denial of the Plaintiff's default motion on the grounds that the complaint ``may have been misplaced,''
and that therefore entry of default ``will work an injustice upon KRT.''
6. On August 15, 1994 Plaintiff filed its response to Defendant's objection contending that the provisions of 41 CFR
60.32(c) are mandatory.
41 CFR 60.30.32(c) provides that if a hearing is not requested within 25 days of the filing of the complaint, the allegations
of the complaint shall be adopted as findings, and the sanctions and/or penalties sought in the complaint shall be
imposed. It appears that the above provisions of 41 CFR 60.30.32(c) are mandatory and not discretionary.
Since Defendant has neither filed an answer nor asked for an extension of time within which to answer, and has to date
not requested a hearing in any other way, Plaintiff's Motion for Default is granted and Plaintiff's Proposed Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which are attached and incorporated herein by this reference, are adopted as the findings
herein.
It is therefore ordered that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts are immediately canceled; and that KRT
or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates),
are declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications
of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has
demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in
compliance with the provisions of the Executive Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole
any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive
Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086.

Administrative Complaint





Pursuant to 41 CFR 60-30.5 and 41 CFR 60-30.32, Plaintiff, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,
United States Department of Labor (hereinafter ``OFCCP''), by it attorneys, hereby files this Administrative Complaint.
The hearing, if requested, will be subject to the expedited hearing procedures at 41 CFR 60-30.31, 

et seq

. OFCCP alleges the following:


1. This action is brought by OFCCP to enforce the contractual obligations imposed by Executive Order No. 11246 (30
Fed. Reg. 12319), as amended by Executive Order No. 11375 (32 Fed. Reg. 14303) and Executive Order 12086 (43 Fed. Reg.
46501) (hereinafter ``the Executive Order'') and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.


2. Jurisdiction exists under Sections 208 and 301 of the Executive Order and the following regulations: 41 CFR 60-1.34,
41 CFR 60-1.26 and 41 CFR 60-4.8 and 41 CFR Part 60-30.


3. KRT Drywall/Acoustical (hereinafter ``Defendant'') is a construction contractor specializing in drywall work.


4. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has maintained its principal place of business in Logan, Utah.


5. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has held a Federal or federally assisted construction contract of $10,000
or more.


6. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has been a Government contractor, subcontractor or federally assisted
construction contractor within the meaning of the Executive Order and at all pertinent times has been subject to the
contractual obligations imposed on Government contractors and subcontractors by the Executive Order and the implementing
regulations issued thereunder.


7. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has been required to abide by the affirmative action requirements set forth
in 41 CFR Part 60-4.


8. On May 12, 1992, OFCCP commenced a compliance review of Defendant. That review resulted in a Notice of Violation
issued on May 26, 1992, finding that Defendant had violated its affirmative action obligations in six specific respects.


9. On June 26, 1992, OFCCP and Defendant entered into a Conciliation Agreement resolving the deficiencies identified
in the May 26, 1992 Notice of Violation.


10. Defendant agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports at six month
intervals. The reports were to include information on the number of vacancies for each craft, the number of contacts
KRT had with linkage and recruitment sources to fill those vacancies, the number of applications received by KRT from
each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires by race, sex and ethnicity.


11. The Conciliation Agreement was to remain in full force and effect until OFCCP determined that Defendant had submitted
two acceptable reports as defined by the Agreement.


12. Defendant agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to notify certain employment and recruitment organizations
when job vacancies arose and to seek referrals from those organizations. The organizations to be contacted included
the Turning Point Program, the Indian Employment Service and the Utah State Job Service.


13. The first personnel activity summary report was due on November 10, 1992, and was to cover the period of May 1, through
October 31, 1992.


14. Defendant submitted a report on November 30, 1992, which stated that the company had hired 10 male applicants in
the last six months.

<DOCNO> FR940913-2-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940913-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

15. Defendant did not notify the Indian Employment Service or the Turning Point Program of these 10 openings and did
not request that these sources supply applicants for any of these positions, as agreed upon their conciliation agreement.
16. Defendant's first personnel activity report was not timely submitted.
17. Defendant did not specifically request qualified female and minority applicants when it listed job openings
with Job Service.
18. Defendant did not, during the period May 1, through October 31, 1992 make every good effort to recruit and employ
women.
19. By letter dated February 4, 1993, OFCCP notified Defendant that its untimely filing of the first personnel activity
report, its failure to specifically request affirmative action job orders when it contacted the Job Service, and
its failure to make every good faith effort to recruit and employ women during the period from May 1, through October
31, 1992, violated the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement.
20. Defendant's second personnel activity report was due on May 10, 1993, and was to cover the period from November
1, 1992, through April 30, 1993.
21. On May 7, 1993, Defendant filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact
with linkage or recruitment sources during the period covered by the second report.
22. OFCCP contacted and visited KRT during June and July 1993 in an effort to confirm Defendant's representation that
there had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter.
23. The letter submitted by Defendant to OFCCP on May 7, 1993, misstated defendant's hiring activity during the preceding
six months.
24. During the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993, Defendant failed to maintain personnel records
including hire dates, termination dates and applicant information as required by the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement.
25. Defendant hired a number of individuals during the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993.
26. Defendant did not contact the linkage organizations agencies regarding vacancies filled during the period from
November 1, 1992, through March 30, 1993, and did not request those sources to supply applicants for any of these positions.
27. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP.
28. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 23 through 26, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP.
29. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18 and 23 through 26, above, violate Executive Order
11246, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and therefore violate KRT Drywall/Acoustical's contractual
obligations to the Federal Government.
30. Plaintiff notified Defendant of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the Conciliation
Agreement. Defendant has not demonstrated that it did abide by the terms of the Conciliation Agreement and so, pursuant
to 41 CFR 60-1.34(a), enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately.
31. KRT failed to contact the linkage organizations referenced in the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement; consequently,
Defendant may have failed to consider for employment qualified individuals registered with these organizations.
32. Unless retrained by an Administrative Order, KRT Drywall/Acoustical will continue to violate the obligations
imposed upon it by the Executive Order and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
Wherefore, plaintiff prays for a decision and order pursuant to Section 209 of the Executive Order, 41 CFR 60-1.26
and 41 CFR Part 60-30, permanently enjoining Defendant, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors,
divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it from violating the Executive
Order.
Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order debarring Defendant and its officers, agents, servants, employees,
successors, divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it, from entering
into future Government contracts, subcontractors or federally assisted construction contracts until such time
as Defendant satisfies the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it has undertaken
to correct past acts of noncompliance and that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, but in no event less than 210 days.
Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order canceling any contracts Defendant may hold by the time a final order
is issued.
Plaintiff further prays for such other relief as justice may require.

Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law



Plaintiff Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (``OFCCP'') filed this action on July 12, 1994. As is set
forth more fully in OFCCP's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions filed this date, defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical
a/k/a Construction Associates (hereinafter ``KRT'') failed to answer the Administrative Complaint or to request
a hearing within the period provided by the applicable regulations. 41 CFR 60-30.6 and 60-30.32. The Administrative
Law Judge therefore is required to enter a default judgment against KRT. 41 CFR 60-30.32(c).




OFCCP proposes that the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law be included in the Order of Judgment issued
in this case. 


I. Findings of Fact 


1. KRT Drywall/Acoustical (``KRT'') is a construction contractor specializing in drywall work. 
2. At all times pertinent hereto KRT has held a federal or federally assisted construction contract or subcontract
of $10,000 or more. 
3. On May 12, 1992, OFCCP commenced a compliance review of KRT. 
4. On May 26, 1992, OFCCP issued to KRT a Notice of Violation finding that KRT had violated its affirmative action obligations
in six specific respects and was not in compliance with the requirements of Executive Order 11246.
5. On June 16, 1992, OFCCP and KRT entered into a Conciliation Agreement resolving the deficiencies identified in
the May 26, 1992 Notice of Violation. 
6. KRT agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports at six month intervals.
These reports were to include information for the relevant six-month period on the number of vacancies for each craft,

received by KRT from each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires
by race, sex and ethnicity.
7. The Conciliation Agreement was to remain in full force and effect until OFCCP determined that KRT had submitted
two acceptable reports as defined by the Agreement.
8. KRT agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to notify certain employment and recruitment organizations when job
vacancies arose and to seek referrals from those organizations. The organizations to be contacted included the Turning
Point Program, the Indian Employment Service and the Utah State Job Service.

1, through October 31, 1992. 
10. On November 30, 1992, KRT submitted a report which stated that the company had hired 10 male applicants in the six
month period covered by the report.

14. KRT did not, during the period May 1, through October 31, 1992 make every good effort to recruit and employ women.
15. On February 4, 1993, OFCCP notified KRT that its untimely filing of the first personnel activity report, its failure
to specifically request affirmative action job orders when it contacted the Job Service, and its failure to make every

16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement.
16. KRT's second personnel activity report was due on May 10, 1993, and was to cover the period from November 1, 1992,
through April 30, 1993.
17. On May 7, 1993, KRT filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact
with linkage or recruitment sources, during the period covered by the second report.

had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter.

22. KRT did not contact the linkage organizations agencies regarding vacancies filled during the period from November
1, 1992, through March 30, 1993, and did not request those sources to supply applicants for any of these positions.
23. On September 14, 1993, OFCCP notified KRT of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under
the Conciliation Agreement. OFCCP provided KRT 15 days in which to respond.
24. KRT failed to demonstrate within the 15-day period that it did abide by the terms of the Conciliation Agreement.
25. On July 12, 1994, OFCCP filed an Administrative Complaint in this matter and served upon KRT Requests for Admission.

26. To date, KRT has not answered either the Administrative Complaint or the Requests for Admission.


II. Conclusions of Law


1. The Office of Administrative Law Judges has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Sections 201, 208, and 209
of Executive Order 11246, and 41 CFR 60-1.26 and 41 CFR Part 60-30 of the Secretary of Labor's implementing
regulations, and is empowered to issue a final order determining whether KRT is in current violation of its obligations
under the Executive Order and its implementing regulations and to recommend appropriate remedies and sanctions.
41 CFR 60-30.32(c).
2. KRT is a Government contractor, subcontractor or Federally assisted construction contractor within the meaning
of the Executive Order. At all material times KRT has been subject to the contractual obligations imposed on Government
contractors and subcontractors by the Executive Order, and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.
3. At all material times, KRT has been required to abide by the affirmative action requirements set forth in 41 CFR Part
60-4.
4. KRT breached its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement entered into on June 16, 1992.
5. KRT's actions as described in the Findings of Fact, above, violate Executive Order 11246, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.
6. The Executive Order, and its implementing regulations authorize sanctions, including contract cancellation
and debarment. 

See, 

Section 209 of the Executive Order.
7. Sanctions are appropriate when, as here, a contractor has failed to abide by the terms of a conciliation agreement,
and is in violation of the Executive Order.
8. Under the applicable regulation where, as here, a defendant fails to answer an administrative complaint or to request
a hearing within 20 days of service of that complaint, its right to a hearing shall be deemed waived and the Administrative
Law Judge shall order the sanctions and remedies sought in the administrative complaint. 41 CFR 60-30.32(c).
9. For these reasons, I order that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts immediately be canceled and that
KRT or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates),
be declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications
of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has
demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in
compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that it has
undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole any victims of its past
noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive Order.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Dairyland Power Cooperative; La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering the issuance of a Confirmatory Order modifying
the August 7, 1991, Order (the Decommissioning Order) which authorized the Dairyland Power Cooperative (DPC, the
licensee) to decommission the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor (LACBWR). LACBWR is located 19 miles south of La Crosse,
Wisconsin.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would allow DPC to: (i) make limited changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning
Plan; and (ii) conduct certain tests and experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC
approval. The licensee requested, by letters dated August 2, and August 5, 1994, that the NRC issue an order that revises
the Decommissioning Order to allow DPC limited flexibility under its Decommissioning Plan. This action is consistent
with the flexibility under 10 CFR 50.59 afforded to a licensee authorized to operate a production or utilization facility
and afforded by other Decommissioning Orders issued by the NRC.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The LACBWR has been shut down since April 30, 1987. All spent fuel has been removed from the reactor and is stored in the
fuel element storage well.

The licensee's authority to operate LACBWR was removed by license Amendment No. 56, dated August 4, 1987. The licensee
is authorized to possess but not operate the LACBWR. The NRC in its Order (Decommissioning Order) of August 7, 1991,
directed DPC to decommission the reactor facility in accordance with its Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's
regulations. This action was taken in response to the licensee's application for authorization to decommission
the facility, dated December 21, 1987, as revised February 22, 1988, September 9, 1988, September 30, 1988, January
26, 1989, March 28, 1989, June 6, 1989, October 3, 1989, July 25, 1990, May 10, 1991, and July 25, 1991. Neither the August
7, 1991, Decommissioning Order which directed the licensee to decommission the reactor facility, nor the approved
Decommissioning Plan, contained an approved procedure that would allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility
or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning
Plan, without prior NRC approval. The LACBWR is currently in SAFSTOR in accordance with the approved LACBWR Decommissioning
Plan. This Confirmatory Order would modify the Decommissioning Order and allow the licensee to: (i) make limited
changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct certain tests or experiments
not described in the Decommissioning Plan without prior NRC approval.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The proposed action, procedural in nature, does not involve any significant environmental impacts. The proposed
Confirmatory Order modifies the Decommissioning Order to allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility
or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning
Plan without prior NRC approval provided they do not involve an unreviewed safety question or a significant environmental
impact not previously evaluated.

Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance
that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequence of an accident or reduce the margin
of safety. No changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluent that may be released offsite. Further, there
would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure.

Accordingly, the NRC concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant
effluent and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the NRC has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed action,
any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would
be to deny the request. This would not significantly reduce environmental impacts of plant decommissioning and would
result in reduced flexibility.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment included
as an enclosure to the Decommissioning Order.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



This Environmental Assessment was prepared by the NRC staff, primarily within the Office of Nuclear Material Safety
and Safeguards, Rockville, Maryland. The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of Wisconsin regarding
the environmental impact of the proposed action, and the State did not provide comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon this Environmental Assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC has determined not to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement for the proposed Confirmatory Order.

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee application for the order dated August 2, and August
5, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the La Crosse Public Library, 800 Main Street, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54601.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Revisions to System of Records </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed revision of an existing system of records. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is publishing for
public comment revisions to an existing system of records, NRC-32, Licensee and Applicant Taxpayer Identification
Number Records_NRC. The proposed revisions add six new routine uses which will enhance the NRC's ability to collect
certain license fee debts owed to the U.S. Government. Corresponding changes to other portions of the system notice
are also being made as a result of the additional routine use disclosures. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposes to amend its system of records entitled ``NRC-32, Licensee and
Applicant Taxpayer Identification Number Records_NRC,'' to establish six new routine uses which will enhance the
NRC's ability to collect certain license fee debts owed to the U.S. Government. Existing routine use b. is redesignated
h. New routine use b. permits the disclosure of information in the system to the Defense Manpower Data Center of the
Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, and other Federal, State, or local agencies for computer
matching to identify individuals who are (1) delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to NRC and (2) receiving Federal
salary or benefit payments. NRC will use the information obtained as a result of the matching to collect the debts under
the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365) by voluntary repayment, by administrative
or salary offset, or by referral to collection agencies. New routine use c. permits the disclosure of information
in the system to the General Accounting Office, Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, or other Federal agencies for
further collection action on delinquent accounts. New routine use d. permits disclosures to commercial credit reporting
agencies to obtain or add to a credit history file for use in the administration of debt collection. New routine use
e. permits disclosures to any Federal agency where an NRC debtor is employed or receiving remuneration to enable that
agency to collect a debt owed to the NRC. New routine use f. permits disclosure to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
for computer matching under 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer to collect or to compromise
a claim by NRC against a taxpayer under 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717, and 3718. New routine use g. permits the disclosure of information
from the system to the IRS to collect a debt by offset against the debtor's tax refunds under the Federal Tax Refund Offset
Program. 



Other revisions to the system of records notice are also being made. These include changes to (1) clarify the categories
of individuals covered, (2) add paper records to the categories of records, (3) update the authority for maintaining
the system, and (4) expand the record source categories. 

Accordingly, NRC proposes to amend ``NRC-32, Licensee and Applicant Taxpayer Identification Number Records_NRC,''
in its entirety to read as 
follows: 



NRC-32 



System Name: 



Licensee and Applicant Taxpayer Identification Number Records_NRC. 



System Location: 



License Fee and Debt Collection Branch, Office of the Controller, NRC, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland.




Categories of Individuals Covered by the System: 



NRC licensees and individuals or corporations who have filed applications for an NRC license.

Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3718. 

b. To the Defense Manpower Data Center, Department of Defense; the United States Postal Service; or any other Federal,
State, or local agency to conduct an authorized computer matching program in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974,
as amended, to identify and locate individuals who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the U.S. Government
under certain programs or services administered by the NRC in order to collect the debts under the provisions of the
Debt Collection Act of 1982 (5 U.S.C. 5514) by voluntary 

repayment, by administrative or salary offset, or by referral to collection contractors. 

c. To the U.S. General Accounting Office, Department of Justice, United States Attorney, or other Federal agencies

or by initiating administrative or salary offset procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982
(5 U.S.C. 5514). 

f. To the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by computer matching to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer for the purpose
of locating such taxpayer to collect or to compromise a Federal claim by NRC against the taxpayer pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
6103(m)(2) and in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717, and 3718. Redisclosure of a mailing address obtained from
the IRS may be made only for debt collection purposes, including to a debt collection agency to facilitate the collection
or compromise of a Federal claim under the Debt Collection Act of 1982, except that redisclosure of a mailing address
to a commercial reporting agency is for the limited purpose of obtaining a commercial credit report on the particular
taxpayer. Any such mailing address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared for any other NRC purpose
or disclosed by NRC to another Federal, State, or local agency which seeks to 

locate the same taxpayer for its own debt collection purpose. 

g. Referral of legally enforceable debts to the Internal Revenue Service to be offset against the debtor's tax refunds
under the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes and Amendments Thereto by the American
Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange, and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Relating to Short
Sales of Nasdaq National Market Securities


September 2, 1994.



I. Introduction



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on March 31, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), on June 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``Phlx''), on June 13, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., on June 16, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``PSE''), and on June 27, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), respectively (each individually referred
to herein as an ``Exchange'' and two or more collectively referred to as ``Exchanges''), submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes designed to allow their members to designate certain
short sales of Nasdaq
 National Market (``NM'') securities
 as bid test exempt sales in connection with the bid test applicable to short sales of such securities (``bid test rule''
or ``short sale rule'') recently adopted by the NASD and included in the NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice (``NASD
Rules'').
 On May 9, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1;
 on June 20, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1;
 on June 21, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1;
 on June 30, the PSE filed Amendment No. 1,
 and on August 3, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 2.
 The CBOE proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register 

on May 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on these proposed rule changes. This order approves the Exchanges' proposals and the Exchanges'
Amendments.

















II. Description of Proposals


A. Introduction


The Exchanges have submitted substantially similar proposals to the Commission to amend their respective rules
 so as to coordinate them with the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice relating to a bid test applicable to short sales of NM
securities traded through Nasdaq.
 The proposals require Exchange members who initiate, accept, or transmit for execution, or execute sales of NM securities
for the account of another Exchange member, to designate such sales as long sales, short sales, or bid test exempt sales.
Accordingly, NASD members who receive orders to sell NM securities from or for the account of Exchange members will
have a basis to determine whether such sales are short sales subject to or exempt from the bid test.

Under NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48, sales of NM securities may be designated as bid test exempt if they qualify
for one or more of the exemptions from the bid test included in the rule. One of these exemptions applies to short sales
effected by ``qualified options market makers''
 (``market maker exemption'') to hedge offsetting options positions. This exemption recognizes the need for options
market makers to hedge their options positions by buying or selling (including selling short) shares of underlying
stocks or underlying component stocks contained in stock indexes.





To benefit from the bid test exemption afforded to qualified options market makers, a market maker must be designated
as a qualified options market maker by a ``qualified options exchange.''
 The NASD Rules define a ``qualified options exchange'' as a national securities exchange with Commission approved
rules and procedures governing the designation of qualified options makers. In addition, to be deemed a ``qualified
options exchange,'' the NASD Rules require an exchange to implement procedures governing the surveillance of its
market makers' use of the exemption, as well as to require the exchange to authorize the NASD to limit the designation
of a qualified options market maker where the options exchange finds substantial, willful, or continuing violations
of its rule governing qualified options market makers.







The Exchanges' rules governing qualified options market makers will be implemented as an eighteen month pilot and
will be effective concurrently with the NASD's bid test rule pilot program. The proposals are subject to modification
or termination at the end of the pilot period. Additionally, the exchanges will require market makers to designate
the NM securities to which the NASD market maker exemption will apply.

If an Exchange determines that a qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the market maker
exemption, that Exchange may withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker based
upon that Exchange's determination that such action is warranted in light of the substantial, willful, or continuing
nature of the violation. Each Exchange also will notify the NASD of such a determination so that the NASD may take steps
to ensure that Nasdaq NM sales are executed in compliance with all applicable NASD rules. Moreover, the Exchanges
have designed surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the proposed rule change. Specifically, these
procedures must be implemented to allow the Exchanges to be deemed qualified options exchanges as that term is defined
by the NASD pursuant to the options market maker exemption.






B. The CBOE's Proposal



The CBOE proposes to adopt Rule 15.10 to require members to designate sales of Nasdaq NM securities as long sales, short
sales, or bid-test exempt sales.
 The CBOE proposal allows a short sale to be designated as bid-test exempt if the sale qualifies for one of the NASD's
bid-test exemptions, or, as further provided in the NASD's rule, if the short sale is an exempt hedge transaction in
a ``designated NM security''
 underlying a class of stock options, or included in an index underlying a class of index options for which the market
maker holds an appointment under the CBOE's rules.








Under the CBOE's proposal, a registered market maker will be considered a qualified options market maker in options
on properly designated NM securities. Such a market maker is entitled to engage in ``exempt hedge transactions''
with respect to those NM securities.
 The CBOE's proposed rule will remain effective for the eighteen month pilot period of the NASD's short sale rule, or
for whatever period the market maker short sale exemption remains effective.

<TEXT>
 

The CBOE proposal also provides that if one of its members initiates, accepts for execution, transmits for execution,
or executes a short sale of an NM security without properly identifying it, such a sale may violate certain CBOE rules.
In addition, if a participant designates a short sale as a bid test exempt sale, including claiming the sale to be exempt
by reason of the market maker exemption, but does not satisfy the requirements for such an exemption, or if the sale
is made with the purpose of disrupting or manipulating the market in the security that is the subject of the sale of a
related option, such a sale may also violate certain CBOE rules.
 The CBOE has designed surveillance procedures to monitor member compliance with the CBOE's proposed rule once it
becomes effective.
 Finally, the CBOE has stated its commitment to notify the NASD if the CBOE determines that there has been a substantial,
willful, or continuing violation of its proposed rule.






C. The Phlx's Proposal



The Phlx proposal is substantially the same as the CBOE proposal. The Phlx's proposal creates new Rule 1072 entitled
Reporting Requirements Applicable to Short Sales in NASD/NM Securities. The Phlx proposal applies to Registered
Options Traders (``ROTs'') and specialists. In its original filing, Phlx ROTs and specialists were both limited
to designating Nasdaq NM securities underlying no more than twenty of the options or index options, which the specialist
or ROT has been allocated or assigned respectively, as designated Nasdaq NM securities. The Phlx has since amended
its proposal to state that a Phlx specialist may designate all Nasdaq NM securities in which it is registered.
 The Phlx proposal also amends Phlx Rule 455(d)(12) (Short Sales) by adding a reference to its new Rule 1072.





D. The Amex's Proposal



The Amex proposal is substantially the same as the CBOE proposal. The Amex proposal adds a new paragraph (d) to its Rule
957, Accounts, Orders and Records of Registered Traders Specialists and Associated Persons. The Amex refers to options
specialists and registered options traders, as those terms have the same basic meaning as the CBOE term ``market maker.''
The Amex proposal also amends Amex Rule 590 (Minor Rule Violation Fine Systems) by adding a reference to new paragraph
(d) of its Rule 957.

<TEXT>
 

E. The PSE's Proposal



The PSE proposal is nearly identical to the CBOE proposal. The PSE proposal creates new Rule 4.19, Reporting Requirements
Applicable to Short Sales in Nasdag/NM Securities. The PSE filed an amendment requesting accelerated effectiveness
of its proposal.

28

 In addition, the PSE's proposal contains a non-substantive difference with respect to format.





F. The NYSE's Proposal



The NYSE's proposal is structured differently from those of the CBOE and other Exchanges, though it is not dissimilar
in effect. Instead of referring to ``Nasdag NM securities,'' the NYSE refers to ``Nasdag NMS securities,'' defining
such securities as having the meaning that Part I of Schedule D to the By-Laws of the NASD assigns either to NM or NMS securities.

29

 The NYSE defines a ``qualified options Exchange market maker'' to mean either an NYSE options specialist acting in
respect of one of his specialty options or an NYSE Competitive Options Trader (``COT'') acting in respect of an NYSE
listed option.

30








Unlike the CBOE proposal, the NYSE proposed rule does not state explicitly the prohibition against its members transacting
an improper short sale for the account of another NYSE member. Instead, the NYSE states that the market maker exemption
is available only if the short sale is related to normal market making activity.

31







III. Discussion



The Commission believes that the Exchanges' proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. Specifically, the Commission
believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act

32

 in that they are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public
interest. The proposals coordinate the Exchanges' rules with the NASD's bid test applicable to short sales of NM securities.
The bid test is intended to reduce the potential for abusive short selling practices in the Nasdaq market without restricting
options market makers who may need to sell stocks short in order to hedge options positions resulting from their market
making activities.





The Commission approved the NASD's short sale rule proposal on June 29, 1994,

33

 and in doing so stated that the rule, together with the market maker exemption, is a reasonable approach to short sale
regulation of Nasdaq National Market securities. The Commission believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent
with the NASD's bid test rule. Moreover, the Commission believes the Exchanges' proposals address the limitations
imposed by the NASD for applicability of the market maker exemption.





Specifically, the Exchanges' proposals will implement rules designed so that each Exchange will satisfy the NASD's
definition of a ``qualified options exchange.''

34

 Additionally, the proposals include provisions to allow the Exchanges to designate options market makers, specialists,
and their equivalents as ``qualified options market makers.''

35

 This designation will allow these market makers, specialists, and their equivalent to make use of the NASD's market
maker exemption to the bid test rule.






The first requirement imposed by the NASD for an exchange to be a ``qualified options exchange'' is that it have approved
rules and procedures for designating market makers as qualified options market makers. These standards must be designed
to identify options market makers who regularly engage in market making activities in the particular options class(es).
Accordingly, the CBOE proposal states that a CBOE market maker will be considered a ``qualified options market maker''
in options on properly ``designated NM securities.''

36

 CBOE market makers may designate NM securities underlying options, or included in an index underlying options, for
which they hold an appointment at no more than three trading stations at the CBOE.

37

 A short sale in a designated NM security that is an ``exempt hedge transaction,''

38

 is entitled to the NASD's market maker exemption from its bid test rule. The Phlx,

39

 Amex,

40

 PSE,

41

 and NYSE

42

 have very similar provisions in their proposals. The Commission believes that these standards should help to ensure
that qualified options market makers continue to engage in market making activities in their assigned options, while
not allowing the market maker exemption to be extended beyond its original purpose.

The second requirement for an Exchange to be deemed a ``qualified options exchange'' pursuant to the NASD's rules
is that the exchange have procedures providing for the surveillance of its market makers' use of the market maker exemption
set forth in NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48(h)(1). The purpose of such procedures is to ensure that short sales
effected by qualified options market makers are exempt hedge transactions and that other non-qualified market makers
are not using the exemption. The Commission is satisfied that the Exchanges have provided for the implementation
of such procedures to become effective with the implementation of the NASD's bid test rule. These procedures are intended
to monitor market maker use of the market maker exemption. 
 
Finally, each Exchange, in its respective proposal, has stated that if it determines that a qualified options market
maker has failed to comply with the terms of the exemption, the Exchange may withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation
of a qualified options market maker based upon the Exchange's determination of the substantial, willful, or continuing
nature of the violation.
 The purpose of this provision is to satisfy the third NASD requirement for an exchange to be deemed a qualified options
exchange. That requirement states that an exchange must have rules and procedures authorizing the NASD to withdraw,
suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker if the qualified options exchange has determined
that the qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the market maker exemption, and that
such a withdrawal, suspension, or modification of the market maker's exemption is warranted in light of the substantial,
willful, or continuing nature of the violation.
 The Commission also notes that because each Exchange proposal contains a commitment to notify the NASD of such a determination,
the Exchanges have provided the NASD with the means to withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified
options market maker insofar as Nasdaq NM securities are involved.
 





The Commission approved the NASD's short sale rule on an eighteen month temporary basis, effective September 6, 1994,
through March 5, 1996.
 In doing so, the Commission stated that questions remain whether the market maker exemption from the short sale rule
is appropriate on an ongoing basis. The Commission noted that specialists and other market makers do not enjoy similar
exemptions from the Commission's short sale rule for listed securities under Rule 10a-1 under the Exchange
Act. Consequently, the Exchanges' proposals are approved on a temporary basis, to remain in effect so long as there
exists a market maker exemption to the NASD's short sale rule.
 
 





During the eighteen-month temporary approval period for the NASD's bid test rule, the Commission expects the Exchanges
to gather data on the operation and effectiveness of the rules and procedures relating to the market maker exemption.
In particular, the Exchanges should focus on: gathering data regarding the number of market makers using the market
maker exemption, and the frequency with which they use it; the sufficiency of the surveillance procedures; difficulties
in administering the market maker exemption and the accompanying surveillance procedures; and the nature of any
violations of the market maker exemption. 
 
The Commission finds good cause for approving File Nos. SR-Phlx-94-09, and Amendment Nos. 1 and
2 thereto; SR-Amex-94-21, and Amendment No. 1, thereto; SR-PSE-94-16, and Amendment
No. 1 thereto; and SR-NYSE-94-22 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice
of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Each of the Exchanges' proposed rule changes and amendments is consistent with the CBOE's proposal, notice of which
was published on May 18, 1994,
 and contain only minor variations from the CBOE proposal. As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists
for approving the foregoing rule proposals and amendments on an accelerated basis given that the implementation
date of the NASD bid test rule is September 6, 1994. 
 




IV. Solicitation of Comments 
 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning File Nos. SR-Phlx-94-09,
and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 thereto; SR-Amex-94-21, and Amendment No. 1, thereto; SR-PSE-94-16,
and Amendment No. 1 thereto; and SR-NYSE-94-22. Persons making written submissions should file
six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed
rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change
between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available for inspection and copying
at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organizations. All submissions should refer to
the file number(s) in the caption above and should be submitted by October 4, 1994.
 


V. Conclusion 
 


It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-Amex-94-21, SR-CBOE-94-10, SR-NYSE-94-22,
SR-PSE-94-16, SR-Phlx-94-09), as amended, are hereby approved on a temporary
basis, to remain in effect so long as the current market maker exemption to the NASD's short sale rule remains in effect.

 



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

from the bird strike weight requirements of  25.631 to consider only a 4 pound bird impact for empennage strength
evaluation, instead of the current 8 pound impact.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 11, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final labeling regulations implementing
section 611 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The regulations include
a section which permits a manufacturer to petition EPA to temporarily exempt a product manufactured with a class I
substance from the labeling requirements. The company must prove that there are no substitutes that: do not rely on
the use of a class I substance; reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment; and, are currently or potentially
available. Through this action, EPA proposes to grant petitions for such exemptions for the two specific applications
of products manufactured with class I substances described below, because substitutes that do not rely on the use
of class I substances and reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment are neither potentially nor currently
available. The effect of this action will be to provide the extensions necessary for these two petitioners to develop
potentially available substitutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Section 611 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, requires EPA to promulgate regulations requiring labeling of products
manufactured with, and products and containers containing, ozone-depleting substances. On February 11, 1993 at
58 FR 8136, EPA published the final regulations at 40 CFR part 82, subpart E (40 CFR 82.100 

et seq

). Section 82.120 of the final labeling regulations (40 CFR 82.120), states that a company may petition EPA to temporarily
exempt a product manufactured with a class I substance. To get the exemption, the company must prove that there are
no substitutes that: (1) Do not rely on the use of a class I substance; (2) reduce the overall risk to human health and
the environment; and (3) are currently or potentially available. In the regulations, EPA defines ``potentially
available'' to mean that adequate information exists to support a determination that a substitute for a class I substance
is environmentally acceptable, economically viable, and technologically feasible. 

The petition provision allows the Agency to exempt products manufactured with class I substances from the labeling
requirements where a company shows that it has been unsuccessful in identifying a commercially or potentially available
alternative substance or manufacturing process for its current use of the class I substance and where the Agency finds
that no such alternative substance or process is ``potentially available.'' The two petitions claimed that alternatives
were not ``potentially available'' at this time. In one case, the argument was made that additional time is required
in order to accommodate an extensive evaluation and approval process required by another Federal entity; and, in
the other case, implementation of possible substitutes/manufacturing processes remain uncertain, requiring
additional development of the possible alternative process before full-scale construction of three new manufacturing
facilities can begin. 

As part of the petition review process, EPA developed criteria by which to evaluate the submissions. Unlike the Significant
New Alternatives Policy Program (SNAP) petitions naming acceptable substitutes for eight sectors of industry submitted
under section 612 of the CAA, the petitions submitted under section 611 are reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful
attention given to each application of a class I substance in a manufacturing process. The Agency considered all of
the factors below in determining whether to accept or reject a petition with regard to the technological feasibility
and the environmental acceptability of a substitute. 

In evaluating technological feasibility, EPA considers when the company first began investigating alternative
substances or processes to replace their uses of class I substances; EPA's knowledge about the product/manufacturing
process and possible substitutes; whether parallel manufacturers of similar products have come up with substitutes;
whether a timeline has been developed for implementation of a substitute, including research and development of
a substitute process where applicable; and, whether the timeline seems reasonable where no substitute is commercially
available. In addition, the Agency considers a company's constraints (technology, other Federal requirements,
etc.) in order to determine whether a change is within the control of the company; whether a company is able to state
what it must specifically do to implement the substitute; whether training and procurement of equipment and manufacturing
materials are accessible; what measures have been taken to understand and solve the ``unknowns;'' whether vendors
exist that can meet the product's manufacturing needs; and whether the company has discussed its manufacturing needs
with these vendors. 

In evaluating environmental acceptability, EPA considers whether a substitute is environmentally implementable
in terms of the available technology.

In general these criteria were considered collectively. However, EPA believes that for most companies, implementation
of an alternative, whether it be a drop-in replacement or a complete overhaul of the production process, often entails
significant cost and time constraints. EPA recognizes that companies need lead time in establishing a labeling program
or installing an alternative technology where companies have chosen to switch from a class I substance 
to a substitute in order to comply with the regulations. Companies that have not implemented a substitute are required
to label their products until they have implemented a substitute. Therefore, where a company's early efforts to replace
its uses of controlled substances are prevented through 

unavoidable

 obstacles beyond its control, such as a required Federal review or permit program, or where a substitute requires
additional development through testing due to unknown or unavoidable impediments, EPA has placed greater weight
on such circumstances in developing its determinations, because the ability of a company to switch to an alternative
is seriously hampered by circumstances outside of its control. 
EPA emphasizes that its process of evaluating a company's request for exemption from the labeling requirements is
a different review process from the essential use exemption authorized by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Parties) and could well reach different conclusions. Under the Montreal
Protocol process, member countries can put forth nominations for essential use exemptions that would allow for continued
production of ozone-depleting substances after the production phaseout, to be used in an application for which there
are no suitable substitutes. The Parties receive and review these applications individually and may decide to grant
particular exemption requests. If the Parties agree that a particular applications is essential, additional production
of an ozone-depleting substance will be authorized for that particular application after the phaseout has taken
effect. 
EPA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29410), requesting essential use nominations for CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform
and HBFCs by July 19, 1993. The Agency requested nominations for essential uses of halons on February 12, 1993 (58 FR
6788). Companies nominated their specific applications of a controlled substance to receive an exemption from the
production and consumption phaseout schedule. These nominations are reviewed first by EPA and then by the Montreal
Protocol Parties. The Parties recognized the need for such exemptions because of the accelerated phaseout dates.
Exemptions, if any, will be granted at the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, which may be held as early as June 1994. Nominations
for halon essential uses will be considered earlier since halons are subject to an even more rapid phaseout schedule.
Nominations for essential uses will continue to be considered each year at subsequent meetings of the Parties; thus,
companies will have additional opportunities to request an essential use exemption in the future. The process will
entail a rigorous international review process, which is described in Decision IV/25 of the Fourth Meeting of the
Protocol. Therefore, if a company requests a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements through  82.120
of the labeling regulations, and also wishes to request an exemption for use of controlled substances beyond the phaseout
date, the company must separately nominate its use for an essential use exemption to EPA. 


II. Petitions for Exemption 


Today, EPA proposes to accept two petitions. The first petition, submitted by the Upjohn Company (Upjohn), contends
that Upjohn has a substitute for its use of CFC-12 as a sterilant; however, a review and evaluation period is required
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the alternative can be approved and then implemented. The company
therefore contends that a substitute is not potentially available until the FDA review is completed. EPA is proposing
to grant this exemption until August 31, 1994. 
The other petition, submitted by the E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DuPont), is classified as confidential business
information and thus, EPA cannot disclose the name of its product. (Dupont has produced a petition containing nonconfidential
information that has been placed into the docket). This product, which consists of certain fine synthetic fibers,
uses CFC-11 as a basic process solvent in the fiber manufacturing process. Although Dupont has identified a
possible substitute, it must develop, implement and test a major process change to replace the existing manufacturing
facilities. Therefore, Dupont contends that a substitute is not potentially available until this process has been
identified and current facilities have been successfully modified to ensure that this alternative can in fact be
accommodated.

A. The Upjohn Company 


The Upjohn Company (Upjohn) submitted a petition to exempt six of its pharmaceutical products that are currently
sterilized using CFC-12 from the labeling requirements. The products are Hydrocortisone, Isoflupredone
Acetate, Methylprednisolone acetate, Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Neomycin Sulfate and Prednisolone Hydrous
USP. The company has submitted a request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept Spectinomycin Hydrochloride,
a non-ozone-depleting substance, as a replacement for CFC-12. The alternative is currently used by Upjohn
to sterilize some of its other products; however, FDA review and evaluation is required before it can make a change.
Therefore, Upjohn is submitting this petition based on the premise that the above mentioned products are not currently
or potentially available until FDA approval is obtained. There are no environmental concerns identified with this
substitution; the company clearly has an alternative which it has instituted in other applications and requires
additional time before it can use the substitute in the above applications. 
Without an exemption, the company asserts that it would be required to label the five products until FDA concludes
its review, which would result in a substantial financial loss with little if any environmental benefit. The company
also maintains that by labeling its five products while FDA reviews their submission, users could become confused
by the warning statement and could decide to discontinue use of the products against the advice of their physicians.
Upjohn indicates that such an outcome could result in increased absenteeism from work and potentially severe negative
health effects and expenses incurred by society. 


B. DuPont 


DuPont currently manufactures a fine synthetic fiber using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC-11). DuPont began searching
for an alternative in 1987 and initiated a research and development (R&D) program to find an alternative substance
for the CFC-11. The R&D program was comprised of the following activities: identifying all non-CFC candidates
for replacements; acquiring or fabricating (where none were commercially available) all potential candidates
for testing; conducting tests to ascertain that each candidate possessed the desired properties; further evaluating
those which passed the initial tests in laboratory reviews; performing additional examinations once the candidates
passed the laboratory tests; then performing testing to determine the acceptability of the test product. For six
years, DuPont has researched over 100 potential candidates which hold specific properties required for production
of the fiber. This search has included all reasonable chemical classes including (but not limited to): HCFCs, HFCs,
perfluorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and amines. After consideration of these and other potential alternatives,
Dupont determined that no drop-in or replacement compound (i.e. a substitute that does not require retrofitting
of equipment) for the current manufacturing process was possible. Dupont identified only one or two possible replacement
candidates, which will require complete testing and development and which, even if successful, will require specially
designed and engineered new production facilities. All of the unsuccessful replacement candidates failed to possess
at least one of the physical and chemical properties needed in the manufacturing process. The critical properties
include corrosion characteristics, critical temperature, toxicity, boiling point and ozone depletion potential.
Moreover, use of the possible non-CFC replacement at the current manufacturing facilities is not compatible with
the existing plant process and permits, as well as OSHA and other safety code restrictions. Thus, testing of any non-CFC
replacement must occur at new specially designed and engineered facilities. 
Although a candidate substance has been identified as a possible substitute, Dupont continues to face various technical
difficulties in implementing a new process change. Once a substitute is identified as a possible replacement, pilot
testing of the candidate in a smaller version of a large-scale production facility, the preparation of the design
of the larger facilities, and construction of the plants must ensue in order for the alternative to be tested for large
scale production. DuPont has obtained the necessary local, state and Federal operating permits and general approval
from the appropriate environmental authorities to design, construct and test the pilot plant which will further
verify the production technology and equipment, the new process, and establish new procedures and practices for
the facility operators. In May 1993, this specially engineered and constructed pilot plant was constructed. 
DuPont indicates that it will spend millions of dollars over the next several years for implementation and production
trials in the new facilities. Two years of development activities are planned for the pilot facility in order to test
and refine the manufacturing process. The plant continues to be modified as the need for technical adjustments arise
from the trial runs. This occurs simultaneously with the design of the first facility, selection of a contractor and
construction of the facility. There will be additional actions required to prepare for the first round of commercial
production trials once the facility is built. DuPont will need to certify that each end use for the new fiber product
meets the standards of each customer base, including industry, local, state, and Federal standards. The standards
vary, requiring distinct examinations in order to determine whether for each end use, the product is capable of the
same performance standards as the product made with a CFC. In addition, personnel require retraining, a new workforce
is necessary to carry out the tests for product standards and certifications, and process control systems need monitoring.

DuPont contends that until all of the plants have been constructed, fully evaluated for their productability, and
full-scale production of the saleable fiber product has been initiated following completion of the standards testing,
no substitute is potentially available. Because of these various technical difficulties in design, and process
changes to accommodate further investigation of the potential alternative, the Agency concurs that Dupont has subsequently
shown that an alternative is neither potentially nor currently available. 
Although DuPont estimates it will be unable to meet the global demand for its product by the end of 1996, the substitute
would then be considered to be potentially available, as some of the plants will have undergone equipment quality
checks and production tests and begun producing the product.

III. Proposed Decisions 



EPA proposes to accept these two petitions for temporary exemptions from the labeling requirements until the dates
specified by the petitioners. No company may exceed its deadline without first obtaining approval by the EPA. If the
need for an additional extension is required by either company, an addendum to the petition must be submitted to the
Agency requesting an extension. 



A. Upjohn 



EPA believes that in this case, the alternative identified in the petition is neither potentially nor currently available,
due to additional Federal requirements regarding approval or disapproval of the substitute, which preclude the
company from implementing the change until after a determination under such requirements is made. The circumstances
are outside of the company's control. Absent the FDA requirements, Upjohn would be able to introduce the alternative
substance to its sterilizing operation. This proposed determination is consistent with regulations implementing
section 610 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 which state that companies seeking Federal approval of substitute
chemicals or reformulations may receive a temporary exemption (ninety days) from the product ban r
