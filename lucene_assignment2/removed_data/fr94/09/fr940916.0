Suitability, Personnel Security and Related Programs, Investigations, and Suitability Disqualification Actions

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In April 1991, OPM published interim final regulations that effected major changes in procedures governing background
investigations to determine suitability for competitive service employment and eligibility for employment or
retention in employment in national security positions (56 FR 18650, April 23, 1991). The interim regulations set
forth separate criteria and procedures for security clearances in national security cases and for suitability determinations
in cases not involving national security, and created the OPM Review Panel, an intermediate appellate body for appeals
from OPM suitability decisions. 



OPM has decided to revoke the section of the interim regulations establishing the OPM Review Panel, based on comments
received from the public and experience acquired under the interim regulations during the last three years. OPM has
concluded, as several commenters predicted, that the OPM Review Panel has not served a useful independent reviewing
function.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 OPM promulgated the current suitability and personnel security regulations as an interim final rule with a request
for comments in April 1991. 56 FR 18650-18656 (April 23, 1991). Comments were received from 16 sources, including
individuals, Federal agencies, Federal employee unions, and public interest organizations. 



A number of commenters objected to creation of the OPM Review Panel. One agency criticized the Panel on the ground that
it would create unnecessary delay in the appeal process and increase agency operating costs by keeping appellants
on the payroll for longer periods of time. One public interest organization voiced concern that decisions of the Panel
might not be impartial, given the fact that Panel members would be employed by OPM and their performances would be appraised
by OPM officials. A Federal employee union noted that, historically, internal review boards tend to support decisions
of the parent organization. 

OPM is now abolishing the Review Panel primarily because the Panel has not accomplished its intended purpose. In creating
the Panel, OPM had hoped to decrease costs, provide appellants with a streamlined resolution of their cases, and cut
down on the number of appeals taken in suitability cases to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Experience
has shown, however, that a large number of appellants still proceed with appeals after review by the Panel; thus, the
original purpose conceived for the Panel has not been realized. OPM has, therefore, concluded that the OPM Review
Panel does not provide a useful independent reviewing function and should be abolished. 

Prior to the creation of the Review Panel, individuals could appeal OPM suitability decisions directly to the MSPB,
and the appellants' agencies had the option to suspend them or to retain them in a pay status pending adjudication of
the appeal. Under OPM's interim final rule that established the Review Panel, appellants were retained in a pay status
while their appeals were pending with the Panel, but, if the Panel affirmed OPM's decision, the appellants' agencies
were directed to remove the appellants within five days of receipt of the Panel's decision by the agency. With the elimination
of the Review Panel as announced herein, OPM has determined that appellants' pay status will be the same as it was prior
to creation of the Panel. Therefore, the appellants' employing agencies will have the option to suspend the appellants
or to retain them in an active pay status pending adjudication of the appeal to the MSPB. 



EO 12866, Regulatory Review 



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with EO 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they relate to internal personnel matters within the Federal Government.

of the appeal at the time it is filed. 

(b) Appeal Procedures. The procedures for filing an appeal with the Board are found at Part 1201 of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations. 

(c) Pay Status Pending Appeal. When an employee or appointee whom OPM has determined to be unsuitable files an appeal
to the Board, the employing agency may either suspend the employee or appointee on the day following the date on which
the removal was to have been effected pending adjudication of the appeal, or retain the employee or appointee in an
active duty status for the period, in which event the agency shall so notify the employee or appointee. Part 752 of this
chapter does not apply to the suspension.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this final rule is to codify determinations made by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) with respect
to the 1994 peanut crop: The national average support level for quota peanuts of $678.36 per short ton (st); the national
average support level for additional peanuts of $132 per st; and the minimum Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) export
edible sale price for additional peanuts of $400 per st. The determinations of the national average support levels
for quota and additional peanuts were made pursuant to the statutory requirements of the Agricultural Act of 1949
(the 1949 Act), as amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. The determination of the
minimum CCC export edible sale price for additional peanuts is a discretionary determination made to facilitate
the marketing of additional peanut contract negotiations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866 and has been determined to be significant.



Federal Assistance Program 


The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance,
to which this rule applies are Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 relating to intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 
48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule do preempt State
law, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because CCC is not required by 
5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject of these
determinations. 



Information Collection Requirements 


The amendments to 7 CFR part 1421 set forth in this final rule do not contain information collections that require clearance
by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. 


This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1949 Act. 

On February 15, 1994, the Secretary announced the national average support levels for 1994-crop quota and additional
peanuts and the minimum CCC export edible sales price for 1994-crop additional peanuts. 

Section 1017 of The Food Security Act of 1985 provides that the Secretary shall determine the rate of loans, payments,
and purchases for the 1991 through 1995 crops of commodities without regard to the requirements for notice and public
participation in rulemaking as prescribed in 
5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary. 




Determinations 



A. Quota Peanuts Support Level 


In accordance with section 108B(a)(2) of the 1949 Act, the national average price support level for 1994-crop quota
peanuts must be the corresponding 1993-crop price support level adjusted to reflect any increases in the national
average cost of peanut production (excluding any changes in the cost of land) during the calendar year immediately
preceding marketing year (MY) 1994, except that the MY 1994 price support level cannot exceed the MY 1993 support level
by more than 5 percent. In the event of a reduction in these costs of production, the MY 1994 price support level for quota
peanuts would be required, under the terms of Section 108B, to be unchanged from MY 1993. The MY 1993 quota peanut price
support level is $674.93 per st. The MY 1994 support level for quota peanuts was determined based on the following estimates:

<PARENT> FR940916-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




 






As indicated, relevant peanut production costs increased from calendar year 1992 to 1993. The MY 1994 quota peanut
price support level is accordingly established at $678.36 per st, up $3.43 per st from MY 1993. 



B. Additional Peanut Support Level 



Section 108B(b)(1) of the 1949 Act provides that price support shall be made available for additional peanuts at such
level as the Secretary determines will ensure no losses to CCC from the sale or disposal of such peanuts, taking into
consideration the demand for peanut oil and peanut meal, expected prices of other vegetable oils and protein meals,
and the demand for peanuts in foreign markets. 
 

The MY 1994 price support level for additional peanuts is established at $132 per st to ensure no losses to CCC from the
sale or disposal of such peanuts, up $0.91 per st from MY 1992. Peanuts are pledged as collateral for price support loans.
The peanuts are then sold out of inventory in order to recoup the loan principal, interest and related costs. The statutory
factors have been analyzed as set out below. Based on those factors, it is anticipated that while the current oil market
is unusually strong, there is enough uncertainty in the market to suggest caution in setting the floor price for inventory
peanuts sold for crushing. For that reason, it has been determined that the support rate should remain essentially
unchanged from the level for additional peanuts that was in place for the 1993 crop, that being $131.09 per st. However,
it was determined to increase the support level to reflect a similar percentage increase as applied to the quota support
level, then rounded to the nearest whole dollar which should continue, it has been determined, to be a level which will
reasonably assure no losses on the sale or disposal of additional peanuts for CCC. In making this determination, the
following information was considered. 

1. The domestic use of peanut oil during MY 1994 is forecast to be 117,500 st, up 6.8 percent from MY 1993 projected domestic
use. MY 1994 peanut oil beginning stocks are expected to be 25,000 st, down 50 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average
peanut oil price is expected to be $0.35 per pound, down $0.06 per pound from MY 1993. 


2. The domestic use of peanut meal during MY 1994 is forecast to be 205,000 st, up 44,000 st from MY 1993 projected domestic
use. MY 1994 peanut meal beginning stocks are expected to be 5,000 st, down 1,000 st from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average
peanut meal price is expected to be $155 per st, up $45 per st from MY 1993. 


3. The domestic disappearance of soybean oil during 
MY 1994 is forecast to be 6,525,000 st, up 1.2 percent from projected MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 soybean
oil beginning stocks are expected to be 462,500 st, down 40.5 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average soybean oil price
is expected to be $0.275 per pound, unchanged from 
MY 1993. 


4. The domestic disappearance of cottonseed oil during MY 1994 is forecast to be 530,000 st, unchanged from projected
MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 cottonseed oil beginning stocks are expected to be 42,500 st, up 4.9 percent
from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average cottonseed oil price is expected to be $0.29 per pound, down $0.005 from MY 1993.

5. The domestic disappearance of soybean meal during MY 1994 is forecast to be 24,500,000 st, up 1.0 percent from projected
MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 soybean meal beginning stocks are expected to be 300,000 st, up 
47 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average soybean meal price is expected to be $165 per st, down $35 per st from 
MY 1993. 
6. The domestic disappearance of cottonseed meal during MY 1994 is forecast to be 1,600,000 st, up 
3.9 percent from projected MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 cottonseed meal beginning stocks are expected
to be 40,000 st, up 37.9 percent from MY 1993. The average cottonseed meal price for MY 1994 is expected to be 
$130 per st, down $35 per st from MY 1993. 
7. The world use of peanuts for MY 1993 is expected to be 23.03 million metric tons, down 0.1 percent from MY 1992. World
peanut production for MY 1993 is forecast to be 
22.74 million metric tons, down 1.5 percent from MY 1992. Ending stocks for MY 1993 are forecast at 0.59 million metric
tons, down 30.0 percent from MY 1992. 


C. Minimum CCC Export Edible Sales Price for Additional Peanuts 


The minimum price at which additional peanuts owned or controlled by CCC may be sold for use as edible peanuts in export
markets is a discretionary action that, by practice, is announced at the same time as quota and additional peanut support
levels to facilitate the negotiation of additional peanut contracts by producers and handlers. 
A proposed rule setting forth the MY 1994 minimum CCC export edible sales price of $400 per st as well as other determinations
not related to this notice, was published on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63106). Eight comments were received during the
public comment period that ended on December 2, 1993. Comments were submitted by four grower and sheller organizations
that supported the proposed 
$400 per st minimum CCC export edible sales price. Two manufacturers and two manufacturer organizations made no recommendations
on this issue. For the reasons given in the proposed rule, the minimum price at which 1994-crop additional peanuts
owned or controlled by CCC may be sold for use as edible peanuts in export markets is established at $400 per st.

Payment Programs for Shorn Wool, Wool on Unshorn Lambs, and Mohair (1991-1995) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule amends the regulations that set forth the 1991-1995 wool and mohair payment programs as authorized
by the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended. This interim rule provides that in determining net proceeds for shorn
wool or mohair, effective for 1993 and subsequent marketing years, marketing charges for commissions, coring, or
grading shall not be deducted. This interim rule removes the 1 percent assessment on 1993, 1994, and 1995 marketings
and revises payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year. The changes necessitated by the Omnibus Reconciliation
Act, enacted August 10, 1993, were effective for the 1993 marketing year beginning January 1, 1993. Since the Act made
changes that affect the 1993 and 1994 marketing years which are currently in effect with payments in process, good
cause is shown to make the changes effective immediately without prior notice and comment. Comments will be received
60 days after the effective date and be considered when the rule is to be made final. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 



This interim rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by USDA it has
been determined that this interim rule: 

(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 

(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;


(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 



Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance to which
this rule applies are: National Wool Act Payments_10.059. 



Executive Order 12778 



This interim rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this interim rule
do not preempt State laws and are not retroactive to 1992 and prior crop years. Before any judicial action may be brought
regarding the provisions of this regulation, the administrative appeal provisions set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must
be exhausted.

Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115
(June 24, 1983). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments to 7 CFR part 1468 set forth in this interim rule will not result in any change in the public reporting
burden or in the application for payment. Therefore, the information collection requirements of the Paperwork Reduction
Act are not applicable to the interim rule. 



Request for Comments 



Comments are requested with respect to this interim rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final
rule. 



Background 



The regulations at 7 CFR part 1468 currently set forth the provisions which are used to administer the wool and mohair
programs. These programs are authorized by the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act). 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 amended the Wool Act by: 

(1) Requiring the Secretary of Agriculture not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading
in determining net sales proceeds and national payment rates for shorn wool or mohair; and 

(2) Revising the payment limitation for wool and mohair producers for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000.


Also, the Wool Act authorizes the Secretary to deduct a 1 percent assessment from Wool Act payments made to producers
during the 1991 and 1992 marketing years. Such authority has not been renewed. Removing the 1 percent assessment will
increase producer's Wool Act payments by the 1 percent that was withheld from the 1991 and 1992 marketing year payments.


Not deducting marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading in determining net sales proceeds and national
payment rates for shorn wool and mohair will reduce total Wool Act payments by a small amount. Producers who have marketing
charges for commissions, coring, and grading will have their payments increased slightly; but the national payment
rate will be reduced slightly. This action should encourage more producers to core and grade their wool and mohair
to obtain a higher price for their wool or mohair. 

The decrease in the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000 will reduce payments
slightly. The persons affected by this change would be larger producers who earn over $100,000 for a marketing year.


The statutory requirement not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, grading, and coring in determining net
sales proceeds requires a change in definitions. All references to ``net sales proceeds'' have been changed to ``net
proceeds for payment purposes''. A definition for ``net proceeds for payment purposes'' has been added in  1468.3.


Section 1468.3 is amended by adding the definitions for (1) commission; (2) coring; (3) deductible marketing charges;
(4) grading; (5) gross proceeds; (6) net proceeds; (7) net proceeds for payment purposes; (8) nondeductible marketing
charges; and (9) nonmarketing charges. 

Section 1468.4 is amended to reduce the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year. 

Section 1468.5 is amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.6 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes.
Section 1468.6 is also amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.8 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes.
Section 1468.8 is also amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds, and to remove the 1 percent assessment.


Section 1468.10 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.13 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.15 is removed to withdraw the provision for assessments. 

It is necessary that this regulation be placed in effect as soon as possible. Since the Omnibus Reconciliation Act
amendments went into effect during the 1993 marketing year and assistance in process is being affected by the statutory
changes, these changes need to be implemented immediately so as to impact the 1993 and 1994 marketing years. Accordingly,
good cause is shown for making this rule effective without prior public notice and comment. Comments will be reviewed
after the interim rule is effective.

``gross proceeds,'' ``net proceeds,'' ``net proceeds for payment purposes,'' ``nondeductible marketing charges,''
and ``nonmarketing charges'' definitions to read as follows: 


 1468.3 

Definitions. 


* * * * * 




Commission 

means fees or charges incurred to market shorn wool or mohair on behalf of the producer. Examples of commissions include
charges for overhead charges, operating expenses, in and out charges, insurance, advertising, association dues,
or assessments. 


Coring 

means obtaining a sample representative of a lot of grease wool or mohair. The sample is tested for yield, diameter,
and vegetable matter content. The core sample may also be used to measure clean color. 


* * * * * 




Deductible marketing charges 

means service fees or charges paid by or for the account of the producer that are directly related to marketing of shorn
wool or mohair, such as, but not limited to, transportation (freight), scouring, and carbonizing and are deducted
from a producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments. 


* * * * * 




Grading 

(sorting and classing) means the grouping of like fleeces by measurable characteristics, such as fineness, yield,
vegetable matter type and content, length, strength, and color. Skirting is not considered to be part of the grading
process. 


* * * * * 




Gross proceeds 

means the amount computed for the seller on a grease basis before any marketing or nonmarketing charges have been subtracted.



* * * * * 




Net proceeds 

means the amount paid to the seller after all marketing and nonmarketing charges have been subtracted. 


Net proceeds for payment purposes 

means proceeds that are determined by subtracting from the gross proceeds of the wool or mohair all deductible marketing
charges and any amount of nondeductible marketing charges that exceeds the combined total nondeductible marketing
charges for price support payment established by CCC. This figure is also used in establishing national payment rates
and individual producer payments. 


Nondeductible marketing

 charges means service fees or charges paid by or for the account of the producer for commission, grading, and coring,
and are not deducted from a producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments. CCC shall determine the
combined total charges for commission, grading, and coring on which price support payments will be made. 



Nonmarketing charges 

means charges paid by or for the account of the producer that are not directly related to improving the marketability
of the shorn wool or mohair, such as, but not limited to, storage, bags, advances, interest on advances, shearing,
and association dues, and are not deducted from the producer's gross proceeds to determine price support payments.

(5) The gross amount paid to the seller on a grease basis. 
(6) The net amount paid to the seller after the deduction of all marketing and nonmarketing charges have been subtracted.

(i) (A) The following is applicable to 1993 and prior marketing years. Marketing deductions may be itemized or as a
composite amount for all marketing charges with an explanation of what services are included in that amount. If it
is the practice of a marketing agency to show, on the sales document, only the net proceeds after marketing deductions,
the gross sales proceeds and the amount of the marketing deductions need not be shown, provided the sales document
contains a statement reading substantially as follows: 
``The net proceeds for payment purposes after marketing deductions shown herein were computed by deducting from
the gross proceeds charges for the following marketing services: _ _ _. Details of these charges will be furnished
on request.'' 
(B) All services for which deductions are made shall be enumerated in the blank space indicated. If a sales document
shows charges without specifying their nature, the charges will be considered deductible marketing charges. 
(ii) (A) The following is applicable to 1994 and subsequent marketing years. Nondeductible marketing charges must
be identified separately from other deductible marketing charges and nonmarketing charges and the amount of such
specified. If commissions, grading, and/or coring are identified as being included in marketing charges, the services
that are included in commissions and/or grading must be specified. CCC shall determine the combined total for commission,
grading, and coring charges on which price support payments will be made. Deductible marketing charges and nonmarketing
charges may be itemized or as a composite amount for all deductible marketing charges and nonmarketing charges with
an explanation of what services are included in that amount. If it is the practice of a marketing agency to show only
the net proceeds paid to the seller; the gross sales proceeds, the amount of deductible marketing charges, and nonmarketing
charges need not be shown, provided the sales document contains a statement reading substantially as follows: 
``The net proceeds paid to the seller were computed by subtracting from the gross sales proceeds all marketing charges
and nonmarketing charges. Deductible marketing charges and nonmarketing charges deducted from gross proceeds
include: _ _ _. Details of these charges will be furnished on request.'' 
(B) All the services for which deductions are made shall be enumerated in the blank space as indicated. If a sales document
shows charges without specifying the nature, the charges will be considered deductible marketing charges. 
(iii) If a sales document contains a figure for net proceeds for payment purposes, computed for a location other than
the producer's farm, ranch, or local shipping point, the person preparing the sales document shall show thereon the
name of the location for which the net proceeds for payment purposes have been computed. If a marketing agency has guaranteed
a minimum sales price for the wool or mohair, is unable to sell the wool or mohair for a higher price, and therefore settles
with the producer on the basis of such guaranteed minimum price, the sales document shall be on the basis of guaranteed
minimum price, regardless of a lower price at which the agency may sell the wool or mohair. In such a case, the marketing
agency shall indicate on the sales document that the price is the guaranteed minimum sales price.

6. Section 1468.8 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: 


 1468.8 

Computation of payment. 


(a) (1) The amount of the shorn wool or mohair price support payment shall be computed by applying the rate of payment
to the net proceeds for payment purposes for the wool or mohair marketed during the specified marketing year. For shorn
wool payments, if there is a purchase by the producer of unshorn lambs, the resultant amount shall be reduced, by an
amount resulting from multiplying the liveweight at the time of purchase of such lambs reported in the application
for payment by the calculated wool on shorn lambs price support for such marketing year. If the amount of the reduction
exceeds the payment computed on the shorn wool marketed, the liveweight of lambs which corresponds to the excess amount
shall be carried forward and used to reduce payments on unshorn lambs marketed or slaughtered or shorn wool marketed
in the current or subsequent years. 
(2) Except as provided in  1468.6 (b)(6) with respect to a guaranteed minimum sales price, the net proceeds for
payment purposes for shorn wool and shorn mohair shall be determined by subtracting from the gross sales proceeds
of the shorn wool or mohair all deductible marketing charges, and any amount of nondeductible marketing charges that
exceed the combined total nondeductible marketing charges for price support payment established by CCC. 
(b) The amount of the price support payment due a producer for wool on unshorn lambs shall be computed by applying the
rate of payment to the liveweight of the lambs sold or moved to slaughter during the specified marketing year, reduced,
on account of the purchase or importation by the producer of unshorn lambs, by the liveweight at the time of purchase
or importation of such lambs reported in the application for payments. If the amount of the reduction exceeds the liveweight
of the unshorn lambs sold or moved to slaughter during said marketing year, such excess liveweight shall be carried
forward and used to reduce payments on the wool on unshorn lambs marketed or slaughtered or shorn wool marketed in the
current or subsequent years. 


* * * * * 


7. Section 1468.10 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 1468.10 

Preparation of application. 


(a) Application for price support payments for shorn wool, shorn mohair, and wool on unshorn lambs must be submitted
by completing Form CCC-1155, ``Application for Payment (National Wool Act)''. Marketing agencies may assist
producers in filling out applications by inserting the information on sales of wool and mohair and sending sales documents
to the appropriate county office, but the producer must sign the application and is responsible for the requirements
as to the time and manner of filing the application. If the producer paid marketing charges not shown on the sales document,
such charges shall be considered in arriving at the net proceeds for payment purposes. 


* * * * * 


8. Section 1468.13 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 1468.13 

Payment. 


(a) Payments under this part shall be made only on the basis of the net proceeds for payment purposes received for wool
or mohair or the calculated amount of wool grown on unshorn lambs sold or moved to slaughter. No payment shall be made
on that part of any sale which has been canceled or on the basis of prices or weights which have been fraudulently increased
for the purpose of obtaining higher payments. No payment shall be made on sales to a wool or mohair growers association,
which is not a cooperative marketing association, by its producer-members on the basis of net proceeds for payment
purposes in excess of the fair market value of the wool or mohair (grease basis), as determined by CCC.

Brucellosis in Cattle; State and Area Classifications; California 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis regulations concerning the 
interstate movement of cattle by changing the classification of California 
from Class Free to Class A. We have determined that California no longer meets the standards for Class Free status.
This action imposes certain restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from California.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis is a contagious disease affecting animals and man, caused by 
bacteria of the genus Brucella. 
The brucellosis regulations, contained in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations), provide a system for
classifying States or portions of States according to the rate of Brucella infection present, and the general effectiveness
of a brucellosis control and eradication program. The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class
C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required to be placed under Federal quarantine.

The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months
preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of
brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become
less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status. 
The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail: (1) Maintaining a cattle herd infection
rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) tracing back and successfully closing (investigating
and resolving) a certain percentage of cases of brucellosis infection detected by the Market Cattle Identification
(MCI) program, a program of testing at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments; (3) maintaining
a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments
in the MCI program, identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to
infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan
in effect within a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or
she owns; and (4) maintaining minimum procedural standards for administering the program. 
Because of its herd infection rate, California was classified as a Class Free State on April 4, 1994, in an interim rule
published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 15612-15613, Docket No. 94-009-1); there had been no known brucellosis in cattle in California
for 12 consecutive months. Since then, however, two cattle herds in California have been found to be infected with
brucellosis. 
To attain and maintain Class A status, a State or area must: (1) Not exceed a cattle herd infection rate, due to field
strain Brucella abortus, of 0.25 percent or 2.5 herds per 1,000 based on the number of reactors found within the State
during any 12 consecutive months, except in States with 10,000 or fewer herds; (2) trace to the farm of origin 90 percent
of all brucellosis reactors found in the course of MCI testing; (3) successfully close at least 95 percent of the MCI
reactor cases traced to the farm of origin during the 12-consecutive-month period immediately prior to the most recent
anniversary of the date the State or area was classified Class A; and (4) have a specified surveillance system, as described
above, including an approved individual herd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipient
herd. 
After reviewing California's brucellosis program records, we have concluded that California meets the standards
for Class A status. Therefore, we are removing California from the list of Class Free States or areas in 
 78.41(a) and adding it to the list of Class A States or areas in  78.41(b). 
This action will place certain restrictions on the interstate movement of cattle from California. 


Immediate Action 


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has 
determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without 
prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis.

Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this 
action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these 
conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon 
publication in the 

Federal Register

. We will consider comments that are 
received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
Cattle moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breeding stock, or for feeding. Changing the brucellosis
status of California from Class Free to Class A increases testing requirements governing the interstate movement
of cattle. However, testing requirements for cattle moved interstate for immediate slaughter or to quarantined
feedlots are not affected by this change. Cattle from certified brucellosis-free herds moving interstate are not
affected by this change. 
The groups affected by this action will be herd owners in California, as 
well as buyers and importers of cattle from the State. 
There are an estimated 28,000 cattle herds in California that would be 
affected by this rule. Ninety-eight percent of these are owned by small 
entities. Most of these herds are not certified brucellosis-free. Test-eligible cattle offered for sale from other
than certified brucellosis-free herds must have a negative test under Class A status regulations, but not under regulations
concerning Class Free status. This testing costs approximately $3.25 per head. If such testing were distributed
equally among all herds affected by this rule, the change to Class A status would cost approximately $16 per herd. 
Therefore, we believe that changing the brucellosis status of California 
to Class A would not have a significant economic impact on the small entities affected by this interim rule. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

VI. Procedural Determinations



I. Background on the Kentucky Program



On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Background information
on the Kentucky program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of
approval can be found in the May 18, 1982, 

Federal Register 

(47 FR 21404). Subsequent actions concerning conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR
917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16, and 917.17.



II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated April 18, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KY-1276), Kentucky submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. It replaces a previous proposed amendment dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative
Record No. KY-1260). Kentucky submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Known as Senate Bill
266, the amendment was passed by Kentucky's General Assembly during the 1994 regular session. It consists of proposed
new and amended statutes to KRS pertaining to disposal of coal combustion fly ash, bottom ash, waste from fluidized
bed combustion, and scrubber sludge. The statutes offer surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal
combustion waste on the permit area. Kentucky proposes to revise KRS 350.010 to define coal combustion by-products,
and add a new section of KRS chapter 350 to specify the procedures governing the disposal of coal combustion by-products.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 19, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26153), and in the same document opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on June 20, 1994.

Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment.

Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references
and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment.



Revisions to Kentucky's Statutes With No Corresponding Federal Regulations



1. KRS 350.010_Definition



At KRS 350.010(22), Kentucky is defining ``coal combustion by-products'' to mean fly ash, bottom ash, scrubber sludge,
and waste from fluidized bed combustion, produced by the combustion of coal. Coal combustion by-products do not include
boiler slag, or residues of refuse-derived fuels, such as municipal solid waste, tires, and solvents.

There is no direct Federal counterpart for this definition. However, the Director finds the proposed definition
at KRS 350.010(22) to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.



2. KRS 350_Additions to Statute



(a) At KRS 350(1), Kentucky is adding a provision allowing the State to issue permits authorizing the disposal of coal
combustion by-products at surface coal mining operations.

(b) At KRS 350(2), Kentucky is restricting the application of the statute to the disposal of waste from burning clean
oil or gas with coal, if the oil or gas is used only for startup or flame stabilization. The types of by-products excluded
from application are those coal combustion by-products: (1) For which a special waste formal permit or a special waste
permit-by-rule is required under KRS Chapter 224; (2) that have been mixed or otherwise co-managed with low volume
waste or with materials that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics; (3) generated prior to the effective date
of this Act, unless the applicant can demonstrate that these by-products have not been mixed or otherwise co-managed
with low volume waste or with materials that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics, or (4) which are injected underground.

(c) At KRS 350(3), Kentucky is requiring that an application to modify an existing permit to initially include disposal
of coal combustion by-products be an application for a major revision or an amendment under KRS 350.070.

(d) At KRS 350(4), Kentucky is specifying that modifications for an existing permit that includes coal combustion
by-product disposal may be made by application for a minor revision, where the application proposes disposal of the
same by-products in the same location as approved in the existing permits.

(e) At KRS 350(5), Kentucky is specifying that modifications for an existing permit to increase the amount of coal
combustion by-products to be received, to change the components of the by-products, or to change the generating facility
may be made by application for a minor revision. If the proposed changes result in an increase of concentrations of
heavy metals, or if public notice is deemed necessary, an application for a major revision will be required.

(f) At KRS 350(6), Kentucky is requiring that a permittee keep accurate records, to be available upon request, to the
Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet) showing the source and amount of each
shipment of coal combustion by-products received.

(g) At KRS 350(7), Kentucky is requiring that prior to disposal of coal combustion by-products, any material not approved
for disposal shall be removed from the coal combustion by-productions and records kept.

(h) At KRS 350(8), Kentucky is requiring that coal combustion by-products be disposed of only in the pit or extraction
area, unless the permittee makes a demonstration that no adverse environmental impacts will occur.

(i) At KRS 350(9), Kentucky is prohibiting the disposal of any component of the coal combustion by-products listed
or meeting the criteria of hazardous waste as specified in the State's law and administrative regulations governing
hazardous wastes.

(j) At KRS 350(10), Kentucky is requiring that the permittee prepare and maintain accurate maps showing each location
where coal combustion by-products have been disposed of and the volume of coal combustion by-products disposed of
at that location. Phase I bond release is not permitted unless the appropriate maps have been submitted.

(k) At KRS 350(11), Kentucky is requiring that the permittee or applicant provide representative samples of the coal
combustion by-products, if requested or if required by the issued permit.

(l) At KRS 350(12), Kentucky is requiring that the permittee annually obtain and submit to the Cabinet a laboratory
analysis to characterize the coal combustion by-products in the manner required by KRS Chapter 224 and the Resources
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-580), as amended.

(m) At KRS 350(13), Kentucky is requiring that if the disposal of coal combustion by-products is proposed, any required
newspaper advertisement include the intended action and the name, address, and location of the facility that will
generate the by-products.

(n) At KRS 350(14), Kentucky is requiring that the application include a demonstration that the applicant has the
legal right to dispose of coal combustion by-products on the proposed areas. A copy of the applicable conveyance must
also be included. If the mineral estate has been severed from the surface estate, a written consent from the surface
owner for the disposal or a copy of the conveyance that expressly grants or reserves the right to dispose of coal combustion
by-products must also be included.

(o) At KRS 350(15), Kentucky is requiring that the application include certain identifying information for the generating
facility, a listing of each of the component materials the coal combustion by-products will contain, and the approximate
volume in cubic yards and the approximate tonnage that will be received from the generating facility annually and
for the term of the permit.

(p) At KRS 350(16), Kentucky is requiring that the application include the results of representative sampling and
laboratory analysis of each component of the coal combustion by-products for contaminants listed in Kentucky's
administrative regulations. The analysis must test for certain metals and address neutralization potential and
potential acidity and a demonstration must be made that each component of the by-products does not contain any contaminant
at a concentration that equals or exceeds specified regulatory levels.

(q) At KRS 350(17), Kentucky is requiring that the application describe the proposed methods of by-product handling
and disposal, including methods of record keeping.

(r) At KRS 350(18), Kentucky is requiring that the application include appropriate maps and drawings of all areas
and facilities to be used in the permit area for by-product handling and disposal.

(s) At KRS 350(19), Kentucky is requiring that the application contain a determination of the probable hydrologic
consequences of the disposal of coal combustion by-products for the permit and adjacent area and contain a description
of the measures to be taken to assure that the disposal will not pose a threat to human health or the environment, to minimize
disturbances to the hydrologic balance, and to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit
area. Certain protective and preventative measures must also be described, including measures to be taken to prevent
coal combustion by-products from becoming airborne.

(t) At KRS 350(20), Kentucky is requiring that the application include baseline data to characterize the quality
of ground and surface water in areas that may be affected by disposal of the by-products.

(u) At KRS 350(21), Kentucky is requiring that surface and ground water baseline data collection and monitoring stations
be established, as appropriate. In determining the number and locations of monitoring wells, the Cabinet shall recognize
the distinct differences between disposal of coal combustion by-products under this section and the disposal of
coal combustion by-products for which a special waste formal permit or a special waste registered permit-by-rule
is required under KRS Chapter 224.

(v) At KRS 350(22), Kentucky is requiring that the characterization of ground water include certain specified parameters.

(w) At KRS 350(23), Kentucky is requiring that the characterization of surface water include certain specified parameters.

(x) At KRS 350(24), Kentucky is requiring that the minimum number of sampling events for ground and surface water for
parameters beyond those usually required be in accordance with Kentucky's administrative regulations promulgated
pursuant to KRS Chapter 224, pertaining to special waste landfills used solely for the disposal of coal combustion
by-products.

(y) At KRS 350(25), Kentucky is requiring that the application include a plan for the monitoring and reporting, until
final bond release, of the quality of ground and surface water in areas that may be affected by disposal of by-products
and for the monitoring of contaminants in the ground and surface water.

(z) At KRS 350(26), Kentucky is requiring that the performance bond for the surface mining permit cover the disposal
of by-products on the permit area.

(aa) At KRS 350(27), Kentucky is requiring that a permittee, operator, or person disposing of coal combustion by-products
comply with certain specified environmental performance standards. The performance standards address the handling,
disposal, and placement of the by-products. They include the following requirements: (1) Coal combustion by-products
shall be handled and disposed by the method approved in the permit; (2) disposal areas and facilities used for coal
combustion by-products handling and disposal shall be designed, located, operated, and maintained to assure that
the handling and disposal will not pose a threat to human health or the environment, to minimize disturbances to the
hydrologic balance within the permit area and adjacent area, and to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance
outside the permit area; (3) to the extent practical, areas to receive coal combustion by-products shall be selected
to minimize water contact with the by-products; (4) the coal combustion by-products shall be placed at least four
feet above the seasonal high-water table, unless the applicant demonstrates that no adverse environmental impacts
will occur; (5) the coal combustion by-products shall not be placed within four feet horizontally of a final highwall,
exposed coal seam, or coal outcrop; (6) the volume of coal combustion by-products disposed of on the permit area shall
not exceed the in-place volume of the marketable coal seams to be removed from the permit area; (7) disposal of coal
combustion by-products shall not result in a greater amount of excess spoil than the amount that would result if disposal
of by-products were not part of the permitted operation; (8) the thickness of coal combustion by-products at any point
in any disposal area shall not exceed forty feet; (9) the Cabinet may reduce the allowable maximum volume or thickness
of coal combustion by-products for a disposal area if it determines that the reduction is necessary to assure protection
of human health and the environment; and (10) after the coal combustion by-products are placed in the disposal area,
they shall be covered as contemporaneously as practicable with at least four feet of nonacid-forming spoil material.

(bb) At KRS 350(28), Kentucky is requiring that the permittee monitor and report the quality of surface and ground
water quarterly, with certain exceptions for water quality parameters which are not normally required to be monitored.

(cc) At KRS 350(29), Kentucky is requiring that the monitoring and reporting of ground water quality include the parameters
used in the baseline characterization of ground water specified in subsection (22), unless the State requires different
parameters.

(dd) At KRS 350(30), Kentucky is requiring that the monitoring and reporting of surface water quality include the
parameters used in the baseline characterization of surface water specified in subsection (23), unless the State
requires different parameters.

(ee) At KRS 350(31), Kentucky is requiring that applications submitted under this section be processed in the same
manner as other applications submitted under KRS Chapter 350.

(ff) At KRS 350(32), Kentucky is authorizing the promulgation of administrative regulations under this section
pertaining to the disposal of coal combustion by-products.

There are no direct Federal counterparts to the provisions of the proposed amendment. However, the Director finds
that provided the proposed provisions are in addition to, not in place of or to establish a variance from existing Kentucky
program provisions, the proposed revisions to KRS Chapter 350 are not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA
and the Federal regulations.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
Because no one requested an opportunity to speak at a public hearing, no hearing was held.

Two public comments were received. The first commenter supported the amendment. The second generally supported
the amendment provided that the provisions of the amendment are supplemental to the requirements of the approved
state program and impose additional, rather than exclusive, permitting and performance obligations on mine operators.
The commenter also felt clarification should be sought in the areas of characterization requirements for surface
and ground water and variances in contemporaneous reclamation obligations. The Director notes that the proposed
amendment is being approved with the provision that the statutes will be implemented in addition to, and not in place
of, existing State program provisions. Therefore, because the provisions of the proposed amendment are in addition
to the requirements of SMCRA and are not inconsistent with the SMCRA, and because OSM is approving the proposed regulations
to the extent that the additional characterization requirements for surface and ground water are required to be collected
in the same manner and for the same duration as the baseline hydrologic information required under SMCRA and no delays
in contemporaneous reclamation will be permitted based on waste disposal, additional clarification is not required.



Federal Agency Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program.

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health
Administration, concurred without comment. The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, suggested that
certain provisions be required in the implementing regulations relating to type of fill, testing procedures, baseline
data characterization and monitoring, and hydrologic models. The Director notes that the comments will be forwarded
to the State for consideration. However, the proposed statutes, as submitted, are not inconsistent with the provisions
of SMCRA.



Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to
those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under
the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq

.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq

.).

On May 20, 1994, OSM solicited EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment. On June 9, 1994, EPA gave its written
concurrence (Administrative Record No. KY-1291).



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Kentucky on April 18, 1994.

<TEXT>
 

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 917, codifying decisions concerning the Kentucky program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Department of the Treasury
gives notice of an amendment to exempt the new system of records entitled Internal Security Management Information
System (ISMIS)_Treasury/IRS 60.011 from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemption is to comply with legal
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information and to protect certain information on individuals
maintained in this system of records.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of the Treasury published a notice of proposed rule exempting a system of records in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 44481, dated August 23, 1993. The Internal Revenue Service published a notice of proposed new system of records
in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 40644, dated July 28, 1993.




Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the head of an agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency
from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 if the agency or component thereof that maintains the system performs
as its principal function any activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The Office of the Chief Inspector
has as its principal function activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.

To the extent the exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) does not apply to the above-named system, then exemption under
5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), relating to investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, is hereby claimed
for this system.

The proposed rule requested that public comments be sent to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Internal Revenue
Service no later than September 22, 1993. No comments pertaining to the proposed rule were received by the Office of
Disclosure. Accordingly, the Department of Treasury is hereby giving notice that the new system of records entitled
Internal Security Management Information System (ISMIS)_Treasury/IRS 60.011 is exempt from provisions of the
Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and the authority of 31 CFR 1.23(c). The reason for exempting this system
of records from this provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a is set forth in the rule itself.

It has been determined that this rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.'' Departmental experience
indicates that the rule does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter
the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities,
or the regulatory principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, it is hereby certified that
this rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of the Treasury has determined
that this final rule would not impose new recordkeeping, application, reporting, or other types of information collection
requirements.

The following correction is made to the rule as published on August 23, 1993 at 58 FR 44482, column 2, line 21, by changing
paragraph designation ``(b)'' to ``(a)''.

Special Local Regulations for Marine Events; Atlantic Ocean, Ocean City, MD



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Special Local Regulations are being adopted for the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix held annually about Labor Day in
the Atlantic Ocean off Ocean City. The effect of these regulations will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated
area for the safety of spectators and participants. These regulations are needed to provide for the safety of life,
limb, and property on the navigable waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning this regulation in the 

Federal Register

 on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29403). Interested persons were requested to submit comments and none were received. The 60-day
comment period ended on August 8, 1994.



Drafting Information


The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard
District, and LCDR Christopher Abel, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.



Background and Purpose



The Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix, sponsored by the United States Offshore Racing Association is an annual event
held on the Atlantic Ocean off of Ocean City. As part of the application, the sponsor requested that the Coast Guard
provide control of spectator and commercial traffic within the regulated area.



Discussion of Regulations



This regulation will regulate the area surrounding the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix race course on the Atlantic
Ocean off of Ocean City. The course runs from Ocean City Inlet to Maryland Beach. To provide for the safety of participants,
spectators, and vessels transiting the area, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area.
A temporary spectator anchorage area will be established for what is expected to be a large spectator fleet. Coast
Guard patrol vessels will be positioned at Ocean City Inlet to direct vessels around the regulated area, or to the temporary
spectator anchorage area. The sponsor usually provides 29 vessels to assist the Coast Guard and local government
agencies in patrolling the event. Medical vessels will display fluorescent orange placards, and patrol boats will
display fluorescent green placards.

Good cause exists for making this rule effective less than thirty days from the date of publication because the Coast
Guard did not have adequate time after the required comment period for this rule to publish the rule more than thirty
days before this year's event.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This regulation will only be in effect for three hours, and the impacts on routine
navigation are expected to be minimal.



Small Entities



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposed rule contains no collection of Information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the final rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.C of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and been placed in the rulemaking docket.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a new operating regulation to limit the number of openings of the East Sunrise Boulevard
Drawbridge, mile 1062.6 at Fort Lauderdale during certain periods. This rule is being made to relieve highway congestion
created by back-to-back bridge openings while still meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Brodie Rich, Project Manager, and LT. J.M. Losego, Project
Counsel.


Regulatory History


On June 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 29405). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.


Background and Purpose


This new drawbridge presently opens on signal. Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. requested that the Coast Guard conduct
a study to determine whether scheduled openings would improve traffic conditions in the area. The bridge owner (Florida
Department of Transportation) recommended hour and half-hour openings on weekdays and 20-minute openings on weekends
during the season to reduce traffic delays. A Coast Guard evaluation of the proposal concluded that the very light
highway traffic levels for this six-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed
opening schedules. However, in order to eliminate back-to-back openings during the tourist season, the Coast Guard
tested a 15-minute opening schedule between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily from December 1, 1993 through January 30, 1994,
pursuant to a published Notice of Deviation (58 FR 65668; December 16, 1993). No comments were received in response
to the Notice of Deviation. The results of the test indicated that traffic backups created by back-to-back openings
were reduced.
The rule allows for a 15-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily during the season (November
15th through May 15th). This schedule should eliminate back-to-back openings and help to reduce traffic delays without
unreasonably impacting navigation.


Discussion of Comments and Changes


We received no comments in response to our public notice. The Final rule is unchanged from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs with tows.

Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since tugs with tows are exempt from this rule,
the economic impact is expected to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.b.2.g(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, FL



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is changing the regulations governing the operation of the State Road 402 Max Brewer Bridge, mile 878.9,
at Titusville by permitting the draw to remain closed during different periods. This change is being made to synchronize
the existing closed periods with the periods of peak vehicular traffic. This action will accommodate the needs of
vehicular traffic and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Walt Paskowsky, Project Manager, and LT Jacqueline
Losego, Project Counsel.



Regulatory History



On February 22, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations,
Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, FL in the 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 8428). The Coast Guard received no comments on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not
held.



Background and Purpose



The bridge presently opens on signal except that from 6:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday,
except federal holidays, the draw need not open. NASA, whose employees commute to and from the John F. Kennedy Space
Center, requested a 30 minute increase in the morning closed period extending from 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. This was requested
to insure uninterrupted flow of highway traffic during the heaviest daily commuter traffic periods. The bridgeowner,
Brevard County, concurred with the proposal. A Coast Guard analysis of highway traffic showed the bridge is used almost
exclusively by commuter traffic (90% flow in one direction) for about an hour each weekday morning and afternoon.
The drawbridge is opened frequently due to its substandard clearance (9 feet closed) especially during the fall and
spring vessel migration periods. Holding conditions for vessels are considered adequate to allow vessels to safely
wait for a bridge opening during the commuter closed periods. A review of the traffic data indicates there has been
a change in the timing and density of commuter traffic which requires an earlier morning closed period. In addition,
the data showed there has been a reduction in the amount of afternoon commuter traffic which would allow a change in
the closure periods without requiring an increase in the length of time vessels are required to wait for an opening.



Discussion of Comments and Changes



No comments were received. The owner of the bridge, Brevard County, concurred with the proposed change. The final
rule is, therefore, unchanged from the proposed rule published on February 22, 1994.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of executive order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a) (3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation. (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic
impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10 E of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since the rule exempts tugs with tows, the Coast
Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) that this final rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements.



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed the rule under principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined
that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B., promulgation of operating requirements for drawbridges is categorically
excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the
docket.

Security Zone; Indian Point Nuclear Power Station, Indian Point, NY



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a security zone in the waters of the Hudson River off of Indian Point, New York. This
zone is needed to protect the Indian Point Nuclear Power Station from destruction, loss, or injury from sabotage or
other subversive acts, accidents, or other causes of a similar nature, that may occur as a result of a marine regatta.
This zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the east bank of the Hudson River south of Indian
Point, New York. Entry into or movement within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain
of the Port, New York.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information



The drafters of this notice are LT Rosanne Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York and LCDR J.D. Stieb,
Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office.



Regulatory History



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for not publishing an NPRM as well as making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Due to the late notification of this rally and regatta, there was insufficient time to draft and publish
a notice of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient
time for publication of this temporary final rule 30 days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking
procedures were followed would effectively cancel this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to the public
interest in allowing the freedom of speech and assembly.



Background and Purpose



Greenpeace submitted an application to hold a marine regatta as part of their Rally and Flotilla for Clean Energy on
September 18, 1994. Approximately twenty (20) sailboats and small yachts will sail in the Hudson River past the Indian
Point Nuclear Power Station, Indian Point, New York, to demonstrate support for their land based rally. This security
zone is needed to protect this waterfront facility from damage or injury. This facility has several water intakes
that extend into the Hudson River. This security zone is needed to keep vessels and swimmers at a safe distance from
the water intakes in order to prevent the discharge of debris for the purpose of clogging the water intakes. This security
zone prohibits vessel traffic in all waters of the Hudson River 100 yards off of the Indian Point Nuclear Power Station,
Indian Point, New York. This security zone has been narrowly tailored to impose the least impact on participants and
maritime interests yet provide the level of security necessary to adequately protect the nuclear power station.
Entry into or movement within this security zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the
Port, New York.



Regulatory Evaluation



This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This security zone precludes vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the
east bank of the Hudson River south of Indian Point, New York. However, due to the fact that the duration of the event
is limited; that this portion of the Hudson River is 1,300 yards wide, allowing ample room for the safe transit of vessel
traffic without hindering the participants in this marine regatta; that the event is on a Sunday, meaning that commercial
and recreational traffic is minimal; that this regulation is consistent with the sponsor's plans and causes no impact
to the regatta course; that there is no impact to the course planned by the sponsor of the marine regatta; and that extensive,
advance, notifications will be made to the maritime community, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this
regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.
of commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.

Regulated Navigation Area; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, NC



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary Regulated Navigation Area (RNA) in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway
by the Onslow Swing Bridge. The purpose of the RNA is to ensure the safety of workers who are replacing a fendering system
along the Onslow Swing Bridge and to control maritime traffic which may be delayed because of the fendering project.
The RNA establishes a no-wake speed near the bridge and permits the work barge to block the channel while work is in progress.
All work is expected to take place during daylight hours and the RNA is effective only while the barge or workers are
present.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Drafting Information




The drafters of this regulation are LT John Arenstam, project officer for the Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District,
Portsmouth, VA, and LCDR Christopher Abel, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Background and Purpose



This Regulated Navigation Area was requested by the U.S. Navy to repair the Onslow Swing Bridge on Camp Lejeune, North
Carolina, to ensure the safety of the workers making the repairs and regulating the traffic transiting through the
worksite. Since new pilings and fendering materials must be driven into the bottom of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway,
the barge with the driving machinery may impede traffic while work actually is taking place. Additionally, workers
on the barge may be dangerously impeded or thrown off if the barge is affected by wakes.

The RNA is expected to be activated only during daylight hours while work actually is taking place. When the barge or
workers are not present, the RNA will not be in effect. Mariners will be able to contact the bridge tender on VHF-FM
channel 13 for up-to-date information regarding passage through the worksite. Vessel traffic will not be delayed
for a period of more than 90 minutes.

The RNA regulates the speed of vessels approaching the work area and their passage through the work area.

Good cause exists for making this rule effective without a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and within 30 days of publication
in the 

Federal Register

. The request from the U.S. Navy was received within 30 days of the RNA's effective date. To delay the project until comments
could be received would result in a considerable increase in seasonal maritime traffic passing underneath the bridge
during the repair work. A delay would also significantly increase the cost of the project to the American taxpayers.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is taking direct final action on revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revisions concern
rules from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). The revised rules control VOC
emissions from Architectural Coatings, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing, Storage
of Petroleum Products, Organic Liquid Loading and Can Coating. This approval action will incorporate these rules
into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
In addition, the final action on these rules serves as a final determination that the deficiencies in these rules have
been corrected and that on the effective date of this action, any sanctions or Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) obligations
are permanently stopped. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions
of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards
and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Applicability


The rules being approved into the California SIP include: SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks
from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; Rule 447, Organic
Liquid Loadings; and Rule 452, Can Coating. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
to EPA on March 29, 1994.


Background


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 Act or pre-amended Act), that included the Sacramento Metro Area. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this
area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2),
and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. (40 CFR 52.222). On May 26, 1988, EPA notified
the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2) of the 1977 Act, that the above district's portion of the
California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing
SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public
Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the
CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available
control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections
of those deficiencies.
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Sacramento
Metro Area is classified as severe;
 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.





The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on March 29, 1994, including
the rules being acted on in this notice. This notice addresses EPA's direct-final action for SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural
Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum
Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loadings; and Rule 452, Can Coating. The SMAQMD adopted these rules on November
16, 1993. These submitted rules were found to be complete on June 3, 1994 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that
are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V
 and are being finalized for approval into the SIP.




Rule 442 controls VOC emissions from all coatings applied to stationary structures and their appurtenances, to mobile
homes, to pavements, or to curbs; Rule 443 limits emissions of VOCs from leaking components at chemical plants that
manufacture synthetic organic chemicals and polymers; Rule 446 controls emissions of VOCs from storage tanks for
organic liquids with vapor pressures greater than 1.5 psia under actual storage conditions; Rule 447 controls VOC
emissions at loading facilities of organic liquids; and Rule 452 limits emissions of VOCs from operations involved
in coating of metal containers, coil and cans. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These
rules were originally adopted as part of SMAQMD's effort to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation
and final action for these rules.

EPA Evaluation and Action 



In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. 

For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). Rule
442 controls emissions from a source category for which EPA has not developed a CTG. This rule was evaluated against
the general RACT requirements of the CAA (section 110 and Part D, 40 CFR Part 51), ``Issues relating to VOC Regulation
Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations_Clarifications to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 

Federal Register

SMAQMD's submitted rules include the following significant changes from the current SIP: 




Rule 442, Architectural Coatings 




 Removed the Air Pollution Control Officer's (APCO) discretion in approving alternate test methods, 


 Added statement that results by any listed test method showing non-compliance with any provision of the rule
shall constitute a violation of the rule, 


 Added new category for low solids stains. 




Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing 




 Removed the APCO's discretion in approving alternate test methods, 


 Added statement that results by any listed test method showing non-compliance with any provision of the rule
shall constitute a violation of the rule, 


 Added clear reference to EPA's capture efficiency guidance in 55 FR 26865, June 29, 1990. 




Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products 




 Removed the APCO's discretion in approving alternate test methods, 


 Added clear reference to EPA's capture efficiency guidance in 55 FR 26865, June 29, 1990. 




Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loading 




 Removed the APCO's discretion in approving alternate test methods, 


 Added definition of exempt compounds. 




Rule 452, Can Coating 




 Removed APCO's discretion in approving alternate test methods, 


 Added statement that results by any listed test method showing non-compliance with any provision of the rule
shall constitute a violation of the rule, 


 Added recordkeeping requirement when using an emission control system. 


EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical
and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loadings; and Rule
452, Can Coating are being approved under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)
and part D. 


The final action on these rules serves as a final determination that the deficiencies in these rules have been corrected.
Therefore, if this direct final action is not withdrawn, on November 15, 1994, any sanction or Federal Implementation
Plan Clock is stopped. 


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future implementation
plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


EPA is publishing this document without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective November 15, 1994, unless, by October 17, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 


If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective November 15, 1994.

Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301(a) and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; 
California State Implementation Plan Revision; 
Interim Final Determination That State Has Corrected the Deficiency 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule.




 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

 EPA has published a direct final rulemaking fully approving revisions to the California State Implementation Plan.
The revisions concern Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) Rules 442, Architectural
Coatings; 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; 446, Storage of Petroleum Products;
447, Organic liquid loading, and 452, Can Coating. EPA has also published a proposed rulemaking to provide the public
with an opportunity to comment on EPA's action. If a person submits adverse comments on EPA's proposed action within
30 days of publication of the proposed and direct final actions, EPA will withdraw its direct final action and will
consider any comments received before taking final action on the State's submittal. Based on the proposed full approval,
EPA is making an interim final determination by this action that the State has corrected the deficiency for which a
sanctions clock began on March 17, 1993. This action will defer the application of the offset sanction and defer the
application of the highway sanction. Although this action is effective upon publication, EPA will take comment.
If no comments are received on EPA's proposed approval of the State's submittal, the direct final action published
in today's 

Federal Register

 will also finalize EPA's determination that the State has corrected the deficiency that started the sanctions clock.
If comments are received on EPA's proposed approval and this interim final action, EPA will publish a final action
taking into consideration any comments received. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 



On April 5, 1991, the State submitted SMAQMD's Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing,
and Rule 452, Can Coating. On May 13, 1991, the State submitted SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings, and Rule
446, Storage of Petroleum Products. On October 25, 1991, the State submitted SMAQMD's Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loading.
EPA published a limited disapproval for the above Rules in the 

Federal Register

 on February 16, 1993. 58 FR 8545. EPA's disapproval action started an 18-month clock for the application of one sanction
(followed by a second sanction 6 months later) under section 179 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and a 24-month clock for promulgation
of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under section 110(c) of the Act. The State subsequently submitted revised
rules on March 29, 1994. EPA has taken direct final action on this submittal pursuant to its modified direct final policy
set forth at 59 FR 24054 (May 10, 1994). In the rules section of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA has issued a direct final full approval of the State of California's submittal of SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural
Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum
Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loading, and Rule 452, Can Coating. In addition, in the proposed rules section
of today's 

Federal Register

, EPA has proposed full approval of the State's submittal.

<TEXT>
 

Based on the proposed and direct final approval set forth in today's 

Federal Register

, EPA believes that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the original disapproval deficiency. Therefore,
EPA is taking this final rulemaking action, effective on publication, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency.
However, EPA is also providing the public with an opportunity to comment on this final action. If, based on any comments
on this action and any comments on EPA's proposed full approval of the State's submittal, EPA determines that the State's
submittal is not fully approvable and this final action was inappropriate, EPA will either propose or take final action
finding that the State has not corrected the original disapproval deficiency. As appropriate, EPA will also issue
an interim final determination or a final determination that the deficiency has not been corrected. Until EPA takes
such an action, the application of sanctions will continue to be deferred and or stayed. 
This action does not stop the sanctions clock that started for this area on March 17, 1993. However, this action will
defer the application of the offsets sanction and will defer the application of the highway sanction. See 59 FR 39832
(Aug. 4, 1994). If EPA's direct final action fully approving the State's submittal becomes effective, such action
will permanently stop the sanctions clock and will permanently lift any applied, stayed or deferred sanctions. If
EPA must withdraw the direct final action based on adverse comments and EPA subsequently determines that the State,
in fact, did not correct the disapproval deficiency, EPA will also determine that the State did not correct the deficiency
and the sanctions consequences described in the sanctions rule will apply. See 59 FR 
39832, to be codified at 40 CFR 52.31. 


II. EPA Action 


EPA is taking interim final action finding that the State has corrected the disapproval deficiency that started the
sanctions clock. Based on this action, application of the offset sanction will be deferred and application of the
highway sanction will be deferred until EPA's direct final action fully approving the State's submittal becomes
effective or until EPA takes action proposing or finally disapproving in whole or part the State submittal. If EPA's
direct final action fully approving the State submittal becomes effective, at that time any sanctions clocks will
be permanently stopped and any applied, stayed or deferred sanctions will be permanently lifted. 
Because EPA has preliminarily determined that the State has an approvable plan, relief from sanctions should be provided
as quickly as possible. Therefore, EPA is invoking the good cause exception under the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) in not providing an opportunity for comment before this action takes effect.

1

 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). EPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking before the effective date of this action is
impracticable and contrary to the public interest. EPA has reviewed the State's submittal and, through its proposed
and direct final action is indicating that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency that
started the sanctions clock. Therefore, it is not in the public interest to initially impose sanctions or to keep applied
sanctions in place when the State has most likely done all that it can to correct the deficiency that triggered the sanctions
clock. 




Moreover, it would be impracticable to go through notice-and comment rulemaking on a finding that the State has corrected
the deficiency prior to the rulemaking approving the State's submittal. Therefore, EPA believes that it is necessary
to use the interim final rulemaking process to temporarily stay or defer sanctions while EPA completes its rulemaking
process on the approvability of the State's submittal. Moreover, with respect to the effective date of this action,
EPA is invoking the good cause exception to the 30-day notice requirement of the APA because the purpose of this notice
is to relieve a restriction. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
This action temporarily relieves sources of an additional burden potentially placed on them by the sanctions provisions
of the Act. Therefore, I certify that it does not have an impact on any small entities.

Obligation Guarantees 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Maritime Administration (``MARAD'') is issuing this final rule which amends its regulations for Obligation
Guarantees implementing Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (``Act''). This rule will carry out
the provisions of Subtitle D of Title XIII, Public Law 103-160, enacted on November 30, 1993. Subtitle D authorizes
the Secretary of Transportation (``Secretary'') to guarantee obligations issued to finance (1) the construction,
reconstruction, or reconditioning of eligible export vessels, and (2) advanced shipbuilding technology and modern
shipbuilding technology of a general shipyard facility located in the United States. While Title XI of the Act is applicable
to financing assistance for all types of vessel construction, that part of the Title XI program related to fishing
vessels is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce, (NOAA),
pursuant to NOAA regulations, which appear at 50 CFR Part 253. Subtitle D of Title XIII directed the Secretary to prescribe
interim regulations within 90 days after the date of enactment and a final rule within 270 days after enactment. MARAD
published an interim final rule on March 31, 1994, and is now issuing this final rule that reflects its consideration
of only those comments received that addressed the specific subject matter of the interim final rule. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title XI of the Act, 46 App. U.S.C. 1271 

et seq.,

 authorizes the Secretary to provide guarantees of debt (``obligation guarantees'') issued for the purpose of financing
or refinancing the construction, reconstruction or reconditioning of vessels built in United States shipyards.
Applications for obligation guarantees are made to MARAD, which acts under authority delegated by the Secretary
to the Maritime Administrator (``Administrator''). Prior to execution of a guarantee, MARAD must, among other things,
make determinations of economic soundness of the project and the financial and operating capability of the applicant.
Prior to amendment by Public Law 103-160, guarantees could be issued only for debt incurred by United States
citizens for vessels to be operated under the U.S.-flag. Now, guarantees may be issued with respect to debt obligations
for certain vessels flying foreign flags.

The Title XI program enables owners of eligible vessels to obtain long-term financing on terms and conditions 
and at interest rates comparable to those available to large and financially strong corporations. Funds secured
by the obligation guarantees that are used for financing a vessel 
are borrowed in the private sector. 

Public Law 103-160, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994'' (``Authorization Act''),
was enacted on November 30, 1993. Subtitle D of Title XIII of the Authorization Act, the ``National Shipbuilding and
Shipyard Conversion Act of 1993'' (``Shipbuilding Act''), establishes a National Shipbuilding Initiative (NSI)
program to support the industrial base and national security objectives by assisting in the reestablishment of the
United States shipbuilding industry as a self-sufficient internationally competitive industry. It adds new sections
1111 and 1112 to the Act. 

New section 1111 applies to vessels and provides that the Secretary may guarantee obligations for eligible export
vessels in accordance with the same terms and conditions of Title XI as have been applicable to vessels documented
under United States law. Alternatively, the Secretary may guarantee obligations in accordance with such other terms
as the Secretary determines to be more favorable than the terms otherwise provided in Title XI and to be compatible
with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards. 

Section 1111 also establishes an Interagency Council to ``obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees,
on direct and indirect subsidies, and on other favorable treatment of shipyards provided by foreign governments
to shipyards in competition with United States shipyards.'' New section 1112 applies to shipyards and provides that
the Secretary may guarantee the payment of the principal of, and the interest on, obligations for advanced shipbuilding
technology and modern shipbuilding technology of general shipyard facilities located in the United States. 

Hereinafter in the discussion of this rule, the use of initial capital letters in a term will indicate that it is a defined
term in this Part 298. 
The Act presently provides a limitation of 75 percent or 
871/2 percent of the amount of Actual Cost which can be guaranteed, depending on the category of Vessel financed. However,
in 1985 MARAD formalized the policy, begun in 1982, of issuing Guarantees of no more than 75 percent of the Actual Cost
of a project in reaction to the growing number of defaults in several industry segments. As amended, the regulations
now require a 25 percent equity contribution in every case. The Shipbuilding Act prohibits the Secretary from establishing
any lesser percentage than set by statute that is intended to be applied uniformly to all Guarantees that are subject
to the limitation. 

Subtitle D of Title XIII also makes conforming amendments to Title XI of the Act to reflect the new authority of the Secretary
to issue Guarantees of debt Obligations used to finance Eligible Export Vessels and shipyard modernization and improvement,
in the form of Advanced Shipbuilding Technology or Modern Shipbuilding Technology, abbreviated in this discussion
as ``AST/MST'', and referred to at some places in the text as ``Advanced or Modern Shipbuilding Technology.'' It restricts
the total value of all Guarantees for shipyard modernization and improvement to not more than 121/2 percent of the
funds available per year for loan Guarantees from funds transferred from the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section
108 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. 

As specifically authorized by the Shipbuilding Act that became effective on November 30, 1993, MARAD published conforming
amendments to its Title XI regulations, as an interim final rule (59 FR 5123-33; March 31, 1994), effective on
publication, to avoid delay in implementation of the new law that could adversely impact the NSI program. This interim
final rule was intended to minimize transitional uncertainty, while allowing subsequent fine-tuning of these regulations
based on the opportunity for considered evaluation of comments from interested parties before adopting a final rule.


It was stated that whenever reference is made in the interim final regulations to forms prescribed by MARAD for applications
or other filing requirements, the format of such forms in effect prior to the effective date of these regulations may
be used pending revision and issuance of new forms to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget. To the extent
necessary to reflect statutory requirements, any form submitted may be modified or supplemented to facilitate processing,
but, until new forms have been approved, these regulations do not require more extensive paperwork or reporting requirements
than exist under the present Title XI regulations. Exemptions provided herein should substantially lessen the aggregate
reporting burden.

Discussion of Rulemaking Text 



The discussion that follows summarizes the comments submitted to MARAD by 28 commenters on the interim final rule,
notes where changes have been made to it and the rationale therefor and, where relevant, states why particular recommendations
have not been adopted. In addition to soliciting comments on the interim final rule amendments to the Title XI regulations,
MARAD requested public comment on two additional topics: (1) The issuance by the Secretary of a Letter of Interest
prior to an applicant's submission of a complete application and the subsequent issuance, if any, of a Letter Commitment,
and (2) the establishment of a deadline, such as 60 days, by which the Secretary would act on a Title XI application considered
complete by the Secretary. 

Almost all commenters responded favorably to the proposal that the Secretary exercise discretion to issue a Letter
of Interest prior to the applicant's submission of a complete application. Commenters noted that the procedure could
be particularly useful if the shipbuilder could use the document as a marketing document to compete effectively against
foreign yards that may be able to offer firm financing on the satisfaction of simple conditions. Some suggested that
if MARAD were also to preapprove ship designs, Letters of Interest would be very effective indicators of MARAD's interest
in a proposed financing. One commenter suggested that Letters of Interest could be used by applicants to forecast
the cost of a transaction and the expertise that will be needed to complete a proposed transaction. 

Commenters proposed that requests for Letters of Interest should contain information about (1) the type and design
of the Vessel to be financed and its intended trade, (2) the approximate cost of the Vessel and its proposed builder,
(3) the amount of the requested Guarantee, (4) recent financial information on the prospective shipowner or bareboat
charterer, (5) a description of the collateral to secure the Secretary's Guarantee, and (6) identification of the
country in which the vessel would be owned and documented. A commenter recommended that there be no charge or fee for
the issuance of a Letter of Interest, that the letter be issued prior to the filing of an application, and that the letter
be issued within ten days of the request. 

Several commenters raised two concerns about Letters of Interest. First, they argued that requests for such Letters
must be treated confidentially because a request for a Letter may come during the negotiating process and the requester
shipyard would not want its competitors to be aware of the negotiations or potential prices. A second concern raised
was that the formalization of a Letter of Interest procedure could slow down the expeditious approval by MARAD of loan
guarantee applications by increasing the burden on MARAD or by effectively duplicating the formal application process.
It was suggested by one commenter that MARAD could substitute preapplication meetings for the Letter of Interest.
Additional concern was expressed that the conditions contained in a Letter of Interest should not be deemed by the
agency to be binding if the applicant later demonstrates that it can meet alternative, but equivalent, conditions.


Many commenters thought that the 60-day processing period for completed applications was reasonable, appropriate,
and adequate.

<TEXT>
 

Some commenters suggested a shorter period of 30 days as conforming more closely to international commercial norms.
Some shipyards were concerned that the 60-day turnaround is noncompetitive in the international market because
a ``complete'' application may in itself take more than 60 days to draft. They suggested that guidelines would be necessary
to define the procedures for submitting a complete application. Some suggested that for a pre-approved ship design,
MARAD should be able to issue Letter Commitments within 30 days, and suggested that MARAD review its application requirements
to ensure that it is not requiring burdensome information. One commenter suggested that a deadline for processing
completed applications is an unnecessary requirement. 

MARAD Response: The discussion of the interim final rule stated that a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)
would be published at a later date that would propose modifications to the Title XI regulations to improve administration
of the entire Title XI program. Such modifications were not addressed in the interim rule because they were not required
to implement the amendments made to Title XI resulting from enactment of the Shipbuilding Act. MARAD has determined
that the two specific areas on which comments were solicited_the Letter of Interest and a deadline, such as 60 days,
for processing a complete Title XI application_should be addressed in the NPRM because they apply to both the export
and domestic programs. This will allow MARAD to deal with the issues at the same time. Commenters need not resubmit
their views on Letters of Interest and the 60-day processing period in response to the new rulemaking. Meanwhile,
MARAD will consider requests for Letters of Interest and will make every effort to finish its review of completed applications
within 60 business days. 



Discussion of Regulations by Sections





Note:

 Paragraph references are as designated or redesignated in the interim final rule.



Section 298.2 Definitions
 





(c) Advanced Shipbuilding Technology (``AST'').

 Some shipyards urged that the requirement that AST/MST be located at a ``general shipyard facility'' should not preclude
the design, development and construction of ship-borne AST/MST or mobile marine equipment that incorporates such
technology. 

MARAD Response: The statutory definition of a General Shipyard Facility includes a ``Vessel'' designed for the construction,
repair, rehabilitation, refurbishment or rebuilding of any vessel. To the extent that such a Vessel incorporated
the AST/MST, the regulations would not preclude their eligibility for a Guarantee. 



(e) Closing.

 Certain shipyard commenters requested that the definition of ``Closing'' be amended to clarify that a Mortgage is
not issued at every closing and that a Mortgage may not be available for collateral that does not constitute realty.


MARAD Response: MARAD believes that the current regulations are sufficiently clear. To constitute a ``Closing''
under MARAD's regulations, a Mortgage need not be required. 



(f) Depository.

 A number of commenters argue that it is unfair for MARAD to allow foreign Vessel owners and operators to use as a Depository
foreign financial institutions that are not available to U.S. Vessel owners and operators that participate in the
Title XI program. One commenter was in favor of allowing foreign institutions in foreign countries to act as Depositories
for Eligible Export Vessels. One commenter stated that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico should be specifically added
to the definition of Depositories acceptable under the domestic program and another stated that it assumes the definition
of Depository will not exclude foreign branches of U.S. banks. 

MARAD Response: When a Shipowner or charterer fails to maintain an agreed financial condition, Title XI documents
require that it make certain payments from its net cash flow to the Depository as collateral for MARAD. MARAD agrees
that, for reasons related to the enforceability of its collateral interests, there is insufficient reason to allow
foreign Depositories for Eligible Export Vessels or Vessels in the domestic program. To clarify further the range
of acceptable financial institutions allowed in the Eligible Export Vessel Program, MARAD has explicitly added
financial institutions located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the subsequent specific approval of
MARAD, foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions as acceptable Depository institutions, to hold Vessel charter
hire and Reserve Funds. 



(i) Eligible Export Vessel.

 A number of commenters stated that the definition of Eligible Export Vessels was too ``vague'' and should be clarified
to include all vessel types within the scope of 298.2(bb), the definition of ``Vessel.'' 

MARAD Response: The regulations provide that an Eligible Export Vessel means a ``vessel'' with certain characteristics
and they also provide a more comprehensive definition of ``Vessel.'' MARAD intended the term Eligible Export Vessel
to include the definition of Vessel. The clarification sought by commenters is obtained by amending section 298.2(i)
to read: ``Eligible Export Vessel means a Vessel ``constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned in the United States
for use in world-wide trade that will, upon delivery or redelivery, be placed under or continued to be documented under
the laws of a country other than the United States.''

(k) General Shipyard Facility.

 Many shipyards requested a clarification of whether a General Shipyard Facility must be geographically contiguous
or whether there may be various components of the facility in different locations if it can be shown that there is an
economically feasible means to achieve increases in productivity, efficiency and quality. 

With respect to paragraph (k)(2), relating to a Vessel, floating drydock, or barge that constitutes a General Shipyard
Facility and that must be ``built in the United States,'' one commenter requested clarification that the phrase ``built
in the United States'' has the same meaning in this context as it does for Vessels. 

MARAD Response: The Shipbuilding Act does not explicitly address this question of geographic locations of a yard.
There is no requirement that the components of a shipyard facility be geographically contiguous. A shipyard might
have supply depots or machine shops several blocks away or farther from its main structures and these geographically
separate buildings would, obviously, still be considered part of the yard. For purposes of shipyard modernization
and improvement projects, the test that MARAD uses is whether the facilities at multiple locations, whether owned
or leased, are part of the common enterprise, whether their activities are wholly or almost entirely devoted to the
construction, repair, rehabilitation, refurbishment or rebuilding of any Vessel, and whether the shipyard applicant
has management and control over the project and the personnel employed at each of the locations, whether owned or leased.
The regulation is consistent with MARAD's position and, with this clarification, need not be amended. 

MARAD agrees that the legislative requirement that the floating shipyard facility be built in the United States is
intended to meet the same standard as U.S.-flag Vessels built with Title XI. Accordingly, the definition of a Vessel,
floating drydock, or barge that constitutes a General Shipyard Facility has been amended to require a showing, in
the yard's application for a shipyard modernization Guarantee, that it meets the section 298.11(a) standards with
respect to a Vessel deemed to be of U.S. construction. 



(q) Modern Shipbuilding Technology.

 Many shipyards commented that Title XI financing should be available to a shipyard for any item that will enhance the
shipyard's competitiveness and capabilities even though such items do not constitute the ``best available proven
technology, techniques and processes'' as ``Modern Shipbuilding Technology'' is defined. It was argued that an
application for financing should not be rejected because, standing alone, it does not ``advance the state-of-the-art.''


MARAD Response: MARAD agrees that the intent of the statute and regulation is to allow flexibility in determining
whether a project promotes the purpose of the Shipbuilding Act and whether it constitutes AST/MST. An application
for a Guarantee should not be rejected merely because it does not ``advance the state-of-the-art'' or exceed the ``best
available'' processes of shipyards around the world. It is MARAD's interpretation of the statutory term that it will
be sufficient if a proposed project substantially advances the state-of-the-art or best available processes of
an applicant shipyard and makes it more competitive internationally. The regulation has been rewritten to clarify
MARAD's position. 



(r) Mortgage.

 Several commenters noted that the reference to 46 U.S.C. 31322 was confusing and recommended that it be changed to
46 U.S.C. 31301. Another commenter recommended that the rule should permit the use of valid security interests as
a reasonable substitute when mortgages are not available. An additional commenter argued that MARAD should delete
its reference to ``first mortgage'' as it relates to AST/MST, arguing that MARAD would then retain its flexibility
to allow co-financing with pari passu mortgages. Another commenter suggested that the use of the word ``enforceable''
before ``preferred mortgage'' was unnecessary. 

MARAD Response: The reference in section 298.2(r) has been amended to refer to section 298.2(x), 

Preferred Mortgage,

 which sets out in detail the requirements, among other things, for a foreign mortgage on an Eligible Export Vessel,
relying on 46 U.S.C. 31301. The rule already provides in section 298.31 for the use of other security interests when
Mortgages are unavailable or inappropriate. MARAD believes that it may have a first Mortgage and still enter into


pari passu

 relationships. Such relationships are often the rule in co-financing arrangements. In any event, there is nothing
in Part 298 that would preclude MARAD from accepting other security interests in addition to, or instead of, a Mortgage.
The use of the word ``enforceable'' before Preferred Mortgage is surplus and has been removed, given the requirements
regarding Mortgages in section 298.31(a). 



(w) Person.

 One commenter suggested that the definition of ``Person'' be expanded to include entities that are recognized under
the laws and regulations of a relevant jurisdiction that might not fit neatly under MARAD's definition. No examples
were offered. 

MARAD Response: MARAD believes that, in the absence of any examples of a deficiency in the definition, the existing
definition of Person, which includes an ``individual'' and ``unincorporated organization,'' among many others,
is sufficiently broad to encompass any applicant likely to apply, whether a U.S. or foreign entity. To ensure that
the definition is completely clear, however, MARAD has added the phrase ``or other acceptable legal business entity,''
after the words ``unincorporated organization'' in paragraph (w).

(x) Preferred Mortgage.

 With respect to a Preferred Mortgage, one commenter stated that the reference to 46 CFR 221.43 is incorrect and suggested
that it should refer to section 221.31. 

MARAD Response: The reference to section 221.43 is incorrect, and it should be to 46 CFR 221.23(d). Furthermore, MARAD
notes that the interim final rule inadvertently deleted former provision (s)(4)(vi). That provision has been restored
in the final rule and is redesignated as paragraph (x)(1)(iv)(F). Also, paragraph(x)(3) has been amended to recognize
that a Mortgage or other security interest on a foreign-documented Vessel can qualify as a Preferred Mortgage pursuant
to 46 U.S.C. 31301(6)(B). 



Section 298.2(bb).

 Most commenters objected to the provision precluding U.S. citizens from owning Eligible Export Vessels. They viewed
the provision as discriminating against U.S. citizens and giving unfair preferences to foreign owners. Almost all
of those objecting argued that the prohibition against U.S. citizens owning Eligible Export Vessels went beyond
the provisions of the statute and some argued that it was inconsistent with the intent of Congress to eliminate ``burdensome
citizenship requirements.'' By contrast, one commenter contended that the prohibition of ownership by U.S. citizens
was consistent with congressional intent. Some argued that the statute eliminated all citizenship requirements
except for fishing vessels and oceanographic research or instruction or pollution treatment abatement or control
vessels. Some commenters were concerned that MARAD's regulatory stance would limit the customer base and improperly
restrict, rather than expand, the true scope of the Shipbuilding Act. One commenter asserted that the proscription
of U.S. ownership could be easily evaded by imaginative corporate structuring and the use of charters. Finally, it
was argued that MARAD should encourage U.S. ownership of Eligible Export Vessels as a matter of national security.


MARAD Response: There is no statutory preclusion to U.S. companies participating in the Eligible Export Vessel program.
The Vessels will be delivered in the United States from a U.S. shipyard to a buyer for operation in worldwide trade under
the documentation of a country other than the United States, as the statute requires. A number of ``American'' companies
are, in fact, multi-national companies, and regularly order Vessels from foreign shipyards. Congress intends American
shipyards to enter into the international market, and no sound reason exists to preclude U.S. shipyards from competing
for this portion of the international commercial business. Accordingly, MARAD has removed the prohibition on U.S.
ownership from the definition of an Eligible Export Vessel. 



Section 298.3 Applications



Certain shipyards were concerned about the disclosure provision in subsection (d), 

Confidential information, 

concerning the disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA''), 5 U.S.C. 552, for two reasons:
(1) That in international circles, financing applications are treated with strict confidence; and (2) the added
expense of lawyers' fees for opposing a FOIA request render the Title XI programs non-competitive. 

MARAD Response: MARAD has no authority to amend the FOIA or the Administration's policy that it is to be liberally construed
in favor of disclosure. On the other hand, while MARAD has not modified this section, it will continue to refuse to disclose
information that is deemed by MARAD to be confidential, pursuant to legal authority interpreting the meaning of FOIA
exemption (b)(4), because it would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from
whom it was obtained. MARAD is, of course, also bound by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, for unauthorized disclosures
by Government officials of proprietary information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, which, among other
things, makes it a criminal act to release certain financial information such as a company's balance sheets, bids,
or other proprietary information. 

With respect to paragraph (e), 

Priority,

 some shipyards expressed concern that it accords unjustified priority to (1) ``naval and military auxiliary'' vessels,
(2) Vessels seeking domestic Title XI financing (in that MARAD must review applications for financing for Eligible
Export Vessels in light of those for domestic vessels), and (3) shipyards engaged in naval vessel construction as
well as pilot programs for shipyard modernization and vessel construction. 

MARAD Response: As a matter of maritime policy, MARAD accords priority for ``naval and auxiliary'' Vessels only in
the domestic Title XI program. As for any impact on domestic Vessels, MARAD is required by statute to review applications
regarding Eligible Export Vessels in light of the same standards as apply to Vessels to be documented under U.S. law.
See section 1103(g)(1) of the Act. Any relief in this regard must come from Congress. 

Regarding the priority for shipyards engaged in both naval construction and pilot programs for shipyard modernization,
such priority reflects the intent of Congress in facilitating the conversion of shipyards that have previously engaged
in naval construction to commercial activities. The Title XI legislation is part of the National Shipbuilding Initiative,
which also includes a technology development program for innovative commercial ship design and production processes
and technologies. MARAD intends to administer the Title XI program in a manner that achieves the purposes of the National
Shipbuilding Initiative.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the priority in paragraph (e) for General Shipyard Facilities that have engaged in naval vessel construction
is mandated by section 1359(a)(3) of the Shipbuilding Act with respect to amounts appropriated by the Secretary of
Defense and available for transfer to the Secretary of Transportation. 


Section 298.10 Citizenship 


This section sets forth the citizenship requirements for Title XI applicants and certain other parties that must
establish U.S. citizenship prior to acquiring a legal or beneficial interest in a Vessel financed under Title XI of
the Act. The exceptions to this requirement are Eligible Export Vessels and Eligible Shipyards. 
One commenter stated that Section 298.10 should be deleted because Title XI of the Act no longer contains a citizenship
requirement. Another commenter stated that the intent of Congress was to eliminate the citizenship requirement
for all vessels financed under Title XI, not just Eligible Export Vessels. One commenter stated that the citizenship
requirement in the 1936 Act applies only to a ``fishing vessel or oceanographic research or instruction or pollution
treatment, abatement or control vessel or Eligible Export Vessel.'' 
A commenter pointed out that the parenthetical phrase in new paragraph (e), 

Exemption

, should exclude ``operators'' in order to exempt those entities from being required to prove U.S. citizenship. Another
recommended deletion of this section because all U.S. citizenship requirements have been deleted for Title XI and
stated that as long as U.S. Coast Guard requirements are satisfied, MARAD should impose no additional requirements
on U.S. citizens that could result in discrimination and additional costs. 
MARAD Response: The position of MARAD is that Section 1101(b) of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1271(b)), which was not amended
by the Shipbuilding Act, requires that Vessels, other than Eligible Export Vessels, be owned by citizens of the United
States as defined by section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, 46 App. U.S.C. 802, (the ``Shipping Act''). There
is no legal requirement that a shipyard be owned by a Section 2 U.S. citizen. Review of the Shipbuilding Act and Title
XI does not support the commenter's suggestion that the citizenship requirement for Vessels only applies to ``fishing
vessels or oceanographic research or instruction or pollution treatment, abatement or control vessel.'' Likewise,
a review of the legislative history of the Shipbuilding Act reveals no statement to eliminate the citizenship requirement
for all Vessels financed under Title XI. The statute explicitly requires Section 2 citizen ownership of such Vessels,
other than Eligible Export Vessels. If a bareboat charterer or other operator desires possession and control of U.S.-flag
Vessels, the Shipping Act requires that it be a U.S. citizen or obtain MARAD's prior approval to charter or operate
the Vessel. Consistent with that requirement, it has always been MARAD's policy that Title XI Vessels may not be bareboat
chartered to, or be operated by, non-U.S. citizens. There is no reason to change this position now. Accordingly, bareboat
charterers and other ``operators'' of U.S. flag Vessels will remain subject to section 298.10(a). No amendment to
paragraph (e) is warranted in view of MARAD's disposition of the citizenship issues. 


Section 298.11 Vessel Requirement 


Concerning paragraph (a), 

United States Construction

, certain shipyards claimed that many component parts are manufactured abroad and are not available in the United
States, and others pointed out that U.S. Coast Guard U.S-built requirements relate to vessels operating in the coastwise
trade, which are the most restrictive of all. Accordingly, they recommended excepting Eligible Export Vessels from
these requirements; or that foreign made components are excepted so long as they are ``physically joined'' in this
country; or amendment of this section to permit use of foreign made components so long as they do not exceed 49 percent
of the Vessel's weight. 
MARAD Response: Paragraph (a), 

United States Construction

, has been amended to remove the requirements for fabrication in the United States of components of the hull and superstructure
for Eligible Export Vessels. Corresponding changes in   298.13 and 298.21(c) will make it clear that
even though foreign components of the hull and superstructure may be included for Eligible Export Vessels, these
costs will not be eligible for Title XI loan Guarantees. The intent is to allow hull and superstructure components
from worldwide sources so as to allow the maximum integration of foreign and U.S. shipyard production as U.S. shipyards
may desire for economic and/or competitive reasons in order to penetrate the international commercial market, without
financing the foreign components of the hull and superstructure. Nonetheless, consistent with MARAD's policy since
1986, raw and improved products, such as unshaped, unmolded and unpunched steel can be imported and used in the production
of the hull and superstructure without being excluded from Actual Cost as they are not deemed to be ``components''
of the hull and superstructure. 
Paragraph (c), 

Class, condition, and operation

, was amended in the interim final rule to allow Vessel classification by members of the International Association
of Classification Societies (IACS) ``to be ISO-9000 certified'', rather than restricting classification
authority to the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). With respect to Vessel classification, all but one commenter
favored allowing Vessel classification by all members of the IACS; the ABS stated that this amendment would be contrary
to law at 46 U.S.C. 3316(b) and could place the government's security in serious jeopardy.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940916-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940916-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter stated that the statute only requires the ABS, and not other IACS members, to be ISO-9000 certified.
Another commenter proposed that IACS members should be certified to the ``IACS-Quality System Certification Scheme
(QSCS),'' rather than the ISO-9000 standard. As to compliance with laws and regulations, several commenters
requested that the provision be clarified to state that Eligible Export Vessels need comply only with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations of the country of registry, and treaties and conventions to which the country of registry
is a party, or the laws of the ports it serves. 
MARAD Response: MARAD disagrees with the comment that MARAD is required to recognize solely the ABS as its agent in
all matters related to Vessel classification. It is MARAD's position that it has the authority under section 1104A(b)(6)
of the Act to set classification standards for Eligible Export Vessels without relying on the classification standards
of ABS. Section 1104A(b)(6) of the Act specifically states that the guaranteed vessel ``shall be in class A-1,
American Bureau of Shipping, or shall meet such other standards as may be acceptable to the Secretary * * *.''
There was nothing in the subsequent enactment of 46 U.S.C. 3316(b) that either explicitly or implicitly repealed
MARAD's ``other standard'' authority. That phrase is not limited to a different ABS class than A-1, as ABS contends.
For instance, ABS does not class all Vessels eligible for Title XI loan Guarantees. MARAD does not believe that the
government's security will be in serious danger if the Vessel is not maintained in Class A-1 ABS, so long as it
is classified by an IACS member in accordance with MARAD-approved standards. 
However, MARAD does not agree that the QSCS standard is more appropriate than the ISO 9000 standard. MARAD believes
that the ISO 9000 series reflects a broader and more appropriate set of classification standards, and should be required.
MARAD agrees essentially with the comments about the applicability of U.S. laws and regulations and has modified
this provision accordingly to clarify that Eligible Export Vessels need not comply with all U.S. laws and regulations
as to Vessel condition and operation, but must be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the International
Maritime Organization that are in force at the time of the Vessel's delivery. 


Section 298.12 Applicant and Operator's Qualifications 


One commenter suggested that this section be expanded to include the concept that a shipyard may be the applicant for
Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels and may be the initial party to the documentation, with the ultimate purchaser
assuming the obligations of the contracts as a party upon delivery of the Vessel. Another commenter stated that the
information required with regard to the identity and ownership of the applicant by paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (vi),
which were not amended by the interim final rule, is primarily relevant to establishing citizenship and should not
be required of applicants for Eligible Export Vessel Guarantees. A commenter stated that the content of this section
does not recognize certain structures for corporate entities that exist only in foreign countries, e.g., a ``Gmbh''
under German law, and suggested that there be a separate section for foreign applicants. That commenter also stated
that the required disclosure in paragraph (c)(4) of whether the applicant or a predecessor has been ``in default .
. . with others'' during the past five years needs clarification and should be limited to a default with respect to a
financial instrument that gave rise to a right of the non-defaulting party to receive accelerated payment. 
With respect to the information sought by MARAD in paragraph (c) concerning the applicant's structure, business
applications, activities and management, a commenter remarked that the expense to the ``smaller'' applicant may
be burdensome, particularly where legal and accounting services are required, which services are excluded from
the project's Actual Cost, and that the Secretary's ``waiver authority'' in section 298.13 (``Modified requirements''
in paragraph (h)) should be amended to exempt such applicants for Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels from having
to provide such information. Another commenter stated that the information required by paragraph (f)(2) concerning
all management personnel of an Eligible Shipyard applying for a Guarantee for AST/MST is too broad and should be limited
to senior supervisory personnel of the shipyard. 
MARAD Response: A shipyard can be an applicant for a loan Guarantee under the existing regulations. The shipyard would,
like all applicants, be required to demonstrate successfully that it meets the regulatory requirements for the program,
i.e., that, among other things, it is creditworthy to be the Obligor for the guaranteed Obligations, has an economically
sound use for the Vessel, and can offer sufficient collateral for the guaranteed Obligations. Building a ship solely
on the speculative hope that it could be sold would not qualify. A shipyard, like any qualified Obligor, could transfer
the Title XI obligation before or after delivery to a qualified purchaser with the consent of MARAD. No amendment to
the regulation is necessary as such transfer is allowed as a matter of contract.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940916-0-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940916-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Paragraph (b) prescribes the type of information an applicant is expected to provide about its identity and ownership,
depending on the structure of the organization. The example (``Gmbh'') cited by the commenter is the term used to denote
a German limited liability company, generally comparable to a U.S. corporation. Such a company would file under paragraph
(b)(1) of the regulations. To accommodate all possible applicants, MARAD has added a new paragraph (b)(4) stating
that MARAD will inform any entity that does not fit the other descriptions in paragraph (b) concerning the information
it should submit about its identity and ownership. MARAD will consider the comments it has received with regard to
information required by paragraph (b)(1)(v) and (b)(1)(vi), regarding ownership of capital shares, when preparing
the subsequent rulemaking concerning the administration of the entire Title XI program. 

MARAD sees no reason to change the present wording of paragraph (c)(4) requiring business data for small firms. The
proposal that MARAD limit the information it receives on defaults to defaults on financial instruments that give
rise to accelerated payments is far too limited. MARAD collects this information in order to discover needed information
about the applicant's creditworthiness and its business experience and status. Information about its defaults,
such as defaults on overdue tax liability or even on technical security defaults, can give MARAD valuable information
on which to make a decision. For similar reasons, MARAD rejects the suggestion that it amend paragraph (h) to exempt
the ``smaller'' applicant from describing its structure, activities, and management. The requested information
is necessary for making a proper evaluation and assessment of the applicant regardless of its financial and organizational
size. 

MARAD does agree with the comment proposing that the information sought by paragraph (f)(2) concerning management
personnel of an Eligible Shipyard is too broad. Accordingly, MARAD has amended the provision to limit the information
to that concerning senior supervisory personnel in the yard. 



Section 298.13 Financial Requirements



A commenter stated with respect to paragraph (a)(2)(i), which was not amended by the interim final rule, that the exclusion
from the cost of the project (Actual Cost) of foreign equipment and services, unless a waiver is specifically granted,
should be deleted, along with the section 298.32(a)(6) required provision in the documentation for use of articles,
materials, and supplies of U.S. growth production or manufacture, because these are Buy American provisions that
are obsolete (by virtue of a 1986 amendment to section 298.11(a)). With respect to Eligible Export Vessels, comments
in behalf of U.S. shipyards cited many reasons militating against exclusion of non-U.S. components from Actual Cost,


e.g.,

 few U.S. suppliers have the approval of classification societies other than ABS, and obtaining an equivalent certificate
could be expensive (

i.e.,

 a 5-10 percent differential), and could result in undesirable exceptions to the ship's class that would put
the U.S. shipyard in an unfavorable position vis-a-vis its foreign competitors; foreign shipowners want local components
for ease of replacement and repair; foreign shipowners and designers designate the use of specific components which
the shipbuilder cannot reject; many advanced ship types require components that are not available from U.S. sources
but are from foreign sources; and many components of AST/MST are not available on the U.S. market. 

Based on these assessments, it was recommended that MARAD delete the third sentence in paragraph (a)(2)(i), which
requires the exclusion of all foreign-made components from Actual Cost, as well as an obsolete Buy American provision
remaining in section 298.32(a)(6), which requires only articles, materials or supplies of U.S. growth or origin
to be used in a Title XI Vessel. 

A commenter also objected to the requirement in paragraph (a)(2)(i) for the applicant to submit supporting data,
suggesting that MARAD add a provision stating that where a contract is competitively bid, the applicant is not required
to submit supporting data, such as the cost of materials or worker hours, regarding the contract price, since the competitive
bidding process should satisfy MARAD that the contract price is fair and reasonable. It is asserted that many shipyards
do not bid a contract on such a basis and the requirement to supply such information to MARAD adds unnecessary administrative
costs to the shipyard. A commenter stated that paragraph (a)(3), 

Financing,

 should be harmonized with paragraph (g) with respect to the treatment of subordinated debt and equity since the latter
provides that subordinated debt may be included in equity, while the former disallows its inclusion.

MARAD Response: With respect to the export program, MARAD has determined that the requirements in the third sentence
of paragraph (a)(2)(i) and the provisions of sections 298.32(a)(6) and 298.32(b)(5)(ii), relating to foreign equipment
and materials, should be amended. These provisions were inadvertently left unamended in the regulations in 1986.
With one important exception, foreign components will no longer be excluded from the Actual Cost of a Vessel. The exception
is that foreign components of the hull and superstructure of any Vessel, including an Eligible Export Vessel, are
excluded from Actual Cost; this will ensure that significant Vessel construction and reconstruction that is financed
by the United States will be performed by U.S. yards. MARAD will still need to be apprised of the use of foreign components
and will not exclude them from Actual Cost, recognizing that many components are not available in the U.S. market or
are not available in a cost or delivery competitive basis. MARAD will allow the value of such foreign components in
the hull and superstructure to be used as owner-furnished equipment in meeting the equity requirements of section
298.13(a)(3). 

MARAD declines to adopt the proposal that it not require applicants to submit supporting data, such as labor costs
and worker hours, regarding a construction contract where the contract is competitively bid. Generally, shipyards
must prepare backup data to assure against doing business at a loss. Hence, in virtually all circumstances, the supporting
data are already available, which are all that MARAD is reviewing. Further, as guarantor, MARAD needs to make an independent
determination that the costs reflected in the Obligations are fair and reasonable, and has a statutory responsibility
to ensure that it is guaranteeing no more than the statutory limit of allowable costs. A competitively-bid contract
may reduce the likelihood of MARAD's guaranteeing inflated contract prices, but MARAD does not regard that procedure
as an adequate safeguard. Without conducting its own analysis of the cost of the project, MARAD would not be able to
determine whether (1) it was impermissibly guaranteeing ``soft costs''; (2) subsequent changes and extras were
fair and reasonable; or (3) the contract price exceeded the fair and reasonable cost of the Vessel, despite the competitive
bidding process. 

With respect to the comment that paragraph (a)(3) should be harmonized with paragraph (g) with respect to the treatment
of subordinated debt as equity, MARAD believes that the rule could be improved with the addition of language cross-referencing
the two provisions. Accordingly, it has added directly after the word ``debt,'' in the penultimate sentence of paragraph
(a)(3), a reference to the discretion of the Secretary, provided in paragraph (g) of this section, to allow subordinated
debt as equity.

With regard to

 Primary financial requirements at Closing

 in paragraph (d), a commenter for shipyard interests stated that the factors upon which the existing financial requirements
for a project are based, and which are made applicable under the interim final rule to a General Shipyard Facility owning
AST/MST, do not appear to apply to such technology, and suggests that there should be a separate concept demonstrating
how use of modern shipbuilding practices will enhance the shipyard's competitiveness. That commenter was also troubled
by the fact that financial requirements are generally required to be based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), but that many potential applicants will not have GAAP-based accounts and that restatement to
GAAP would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. This includes the requirement to file MARAD Form MA-172.


According to another commenter, since Actual Cost of a Title XI project, including AST/MST is made up of items that
are usually capitalizable under GAAP, and costs of research and development must generally be expensed, in order
to stimulate and encourage the development and construction of AST/MST MARAD should allow research and development
costs to be included in Actual Cost. Another commenter representing shipyard interests argued that the requirement
that a shipowner's equity be at least 50 percent of its long term debt, exclusive of Title XI debt, is unsatisfactory,
adding that this standard will preclude many potential international shipowners from using U.S. shipyards, since
in the international market, use of such factors as value of the collateral, possibly with some recourse, is the normal
practice. Furthermore, it was argued that there are subsidies available through the European Union and the Australian
government that tip the scales against Title XI financing. Accordingly, that commenter recommended that paragraph
(d)(1)(ii) be amended to the effect that the Vessel will serve as the sole security for the Guarantees; that in a highly
leveraged transaction, additional security should be considered; and that applicants with a well established market
share and a solid trading and revenue profile be required to maintain equity of only 15 percent of total long term debt.


Another commenter argued that MARAD's minimum working capital, net worth, debt to equity ratios, and other financial
ratios are too conservative when applied to the construction of AST/MST, particularly in the first year when expenses
are high. It was alleged that such severe financial restrictions will thwart the purpose of Congress in advancing
and assisting the transition of U.S. shipyards to modern shipyard facilities. One commenter noted that use of the
term ``Owner'' of technology in new paragraph (e)(3) may be limiting because the General Shipyard Facility may be
a ``Lessee'' of that technology. 

Another commenter stated that MARAD should allow more flexibility in reviewing the financial strength of the applicant
as MARAD's equity to debt test provides no flexibility for evaluating potential financial structures as is now used
in the export market, particularly by U.S. aircraft manufacturers for exporting aircraft, nor would it appear to
allow MARAD to review and approve a financing structure utilizing a foreign sales corporation. 

MARAD Response: MARAD is not persuaded by the suggestion that the primary financial requirements at Closing should
not apply to a General Shipyard Facility because they do not apply to AST/MST owned by a General Shipyard Facility.
These financial requirements are criteria used to measure how adequately a company is capitalized to undertake the
business it intends to pursue. MARAD needs that information for AST/MST projects just as it needs the information
for other Title XI projects to assure reasonable prospect of repayment of the underlying debt. 

Regarding the requirement for a restatement of accounts in GAAP format, modern financial analysis requires accurate
and standardized information. Companies seeking loan Guarantees for multimillion dollar projects should be prepared
to demonstrate their creditworthiness in a reliable and standard manner. Thus far, it has been MARAD's experience
with the Eligible Export Vessel program that the requirement for GAAP accounting has not proved an undue burden on
applicants.

Accordingly, MARAD declines to adopt the suggestions that it deviate from its normal financial terms, such as debt
to equity ratios or a minimum net worth test for Eligible Export Vessels or shipyards. MARAD believes that these traditional
tests, set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e), are useful in determining the creditworthiness of an applicant to function
in the marketplace and make its debt service payments. As appropriate, MARAD can modify the existing requirements
as provided under paragraph (h),

 Modified Requirements.

 MARAD also is not convinced to adopt the suggestion that it allow research and development costs to be included in Actual
Cost. The financing of ``soft costs,'' such as research and development costs, exceeds the financing of the specific
project, which is all that is authorized to be financed. 

MARAD has not adopted the suggestion that the financed Vessel be treated as the sole security for a Guarantee because
in some circumstances that collateral will be insufficient to secure the Government's interest. MARAD has a fiduciary
responsibility to ensure that the Government has received sufficient security for its loan Guarantees. Too often,
unfortunately, the proceeds of defaulted Vessels sold to recover MARAD's payments under its Guarantee have not been
sufficient. On the other hand, the current regulations state that ``under normal circumstances'' a financed Vessel
or shipyard technology will be adequate security for the Guarantee. The same regulations authorize the Secretary
to require additional collateral if it is determined that the Mortgage ``is not sufficient to provide adequate security.''
See section 298.31(c). 



Section 298.14 Economic Soundness 



A commenter argued that the new requirement in the interim final rule in paragraph (a)(2)(i) for disclosure of the
``number, type, and buyer of Vessels'' for which AST/MST ``will be used'' is unduly strict since a shipyard may be modernizing
to attract a market segment rather than a specific buyer. Another commenter stated that satisfying the existing Title
XI requirement in paragraph (b)(3) that the internal rate of return (IRR) analysis show a minimum return of 10 percent,
based on the total project cost, would be difficult for the applicant to show in the case of the construction and development
of new and innovative AST/MST facilities and equipment, and will discourage operators of General Shipyard Facilities
from taking initial steps in the direction of greater productivity and efficiency. 

MARAD Response: MARAD recognizes that many shipyards may modernize to attract a market segment rather than a specific
buyer, but MARAD believes that a shipyard's sound economic planning involves making reasonable business projections
about the number and type of Vessels that can be reasonably sold and the number and types of potential buyers that can
be expected to purchase them. Most businesses make such cost-benefit estimates and analyses of their business activities,
especially before they commit substantial amounts of capital to expand their business. Additionally, MARAD does
not believe that the IRR test will pose an insurmountable difficulty to shipyards since most shipyard projects would
not be undertaken unless they were projected to have a minimum internal rate of return of 10 percent. 



Section 298.17 Evaluation of Applications



One commenter suggested adding a fourth consideration for Eligible Export Vessels, in new paragraph (b) of the interim
final rule, ``the export credit terms offered by foreign governments,'' while another commenter states that the
new provision regarding factors considered in determining the applicant's equity requirements is not necessary
as it is within the scope of the economic soundness finding in section 298.14, and should be deleted. 

MARAD Response: The list of items that the Secretary is required to consider in determining the amount of an applicant's
equity was not intended to be exhaustive. MARAD will also consider all relevant factors, including the export credit
terms offered by foreign governments, the convertibility of foreign currency, foreign sovereign guarantees, corporate
parent guarantees, and other credit enhancements in determining the amount of applicant equity. It was deemed appropriate,
however, to give notice to the public of some of the primary items MARAD would consider. Accordingly, MARAD has amended
paragraph (b) to indicate that ``the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the following'' items. 



Section 298.18 Financing Advanced or Modern Shipbuilding Technology 



Two commenters argued that paragraph (a), 

Initial criteria,

 should be deleted as there is no requirement in the Shipbuilding Act that MARAD make a finding that the guaranteed financing
will aid in the transition of U.S. shipyards, and encourage modernization or support increased productivity. A shipyard
requested that there be included in paragraph (b) a definition of ``Technological Life'' of an asset when used to determine
the duration of a Guarantee for AST/MST. 

MARAD Response: Although there is no requirement in the Act that the Guarantee of shipyard financing aid in the transition
of those yards, encourage modernization, and support increased productivity, the Secretary is clearly authorized
to impose such a requirement as a matter of policy. Section 1112(a) of the Act authorizes the Secretary, ``subject
to the terms the Secretary shall prescribe,'' to Guarantee an Obligation for AST/MST. The Secretary has the authority
to prescribe terms so long as they are reasonable and are consistent with the purposes of the Act. One major purpose
of the Shipbuilding Act was to encourage yards in their efforts to make the transition to commercial activities. It
is clear that the initial criteria of section 298.18(a) are reasonable and are consistent with the policies of the
Act. 

MARAD is not yet able to include a definition of a ``technological life'' for a shipyard asset being financed. Although
the request is understandable, MARAD will determine, on a case-by-case basis, what the technological life of financed
assets is likely to be. In general, MARAD does not desire to have its Guarantees extend longer than the ``reasonable
useful life'' of the collective assets which comprise this technology (the AST/MST). 



Section 298.19 Financing Export Vessels



Paragraph (a), 

Transmittal to Secretary of Defense,

 requires the Secretary of Transportation to give the Secretary of Defense notice of receipt of an application. The
Secretary of Defense may disapprove the loan Guarantee for reasons of national security. As to the requirement for
review by the Secretary of Defense, one commenter urged that it should be clear that the Secretary of Defense can only
disapprove the loan Guarantee based on national security interests and for no other reason. In addition, the commenter
stated that the 30-day review period pursuant to which the Secretary has the right to exercise a veto is too long, given
the need to streamline the approval process. Accordingly, the commenter recommended seven days. One commenter suggested
that, to avoid confusion, the third reference to the Secretary in the second sentence of paragraph (a) should include
the words ``of Defense.''

Paragraph (b), 

Determinations by the Secretary,

 sets forth the determinations that must be made in order to issue an Eligible Export Vessel loan Guarantee. Paragraph
(b)(1) requires the Vessel to be of at least 5,000 gross tons if the loan Guarantee commitment cost is made available
from funds transferred from the Secretary of Defense. Several commenters suggested that MARAD should make it clearer
that Vessels under 5,000 gross tons are entitled to be financed as Eligible Export Vessels. In such instances, the
loan Guarantee commitment cost would be charged against the appropriated funds provided by the Department of Transportation
instead of the Department of Defense. However, one shipyard argued that all Eligible Export Vessel projects should
be greater than 5,000 gross tons because the purpose of the statute is to facilitate conversion from defense to commercial
activities. It asserted that to expend resources on relatively small Vessels, such as yachts and service boats, would
not maximize U.S. shipyards' potential to compete in the commercial market. In addition, there would be the added
practical difficulty of administering monies from two sources (Department of Defense and Department of Transportation)
and the administrative overlay would be too expensive. 
Paragraph (b)(3) provides that Guarantees for Eligible Export Vessels shall not be approved unless the Secretary
determines that the country to which the Vessel is to be exported, together with related institutions, is sufficiently
creditworthy. Numerous commenters objected to the requirement that the Secretary make a determination as to the
creditworthiness of the foreign country to which an Eligible Export Vessel is to be exported. They noted that the new
statute does not contain such a requirement and that the regulation does not clarify what is meant by the country ``to
which the Vessel is to be exported.'' The country could be the country of flag, the country where the owner and/or operator
is located, or the countries where the Vessel could operate. Two commenters expressed concern that the creditworthiness
requirement, if applied to the country of flag, would apply to flag-of-convenience countries where the Vessels will
rarely call. One commenter specifically noted that Liberia and Panama, two of the largest Vessel registers, would
be off limits pursuant to such a requirement. The commenter stated that a lender can accept a Mortgage and registration
from a country with poor credit provided the overall project is sound. 
Some commenters argued that the creditworthiness of a foreign nation should not be a concern because the Secretary
will have a security interest in vessels or other collateral. Another commenter suggested that where there is adequate
security for the Guarantees, MARAD's only other legitimate interest should be whether the country of registry's
legal structure provides for adequate enforcement of the Mortgage or other security. One commenter noted that this
is a different loan program from those that would require some political or country risk analysis and the provisions
for a review by the Secretary of Defense should be adequate to screen out deals that may involve entities from countries
whose interests are hostile to the U.S. or who pose a threat to our national security. Another commenter noted that
the regulation does not identify the issues or elements to be weighed by the Secretary in making a determination of
``creditworthiness'' nor do they state the standards against which such elements shall be measured. 
MARAD Response: The role of the Secretary of Defense is established by statute. See section 1104A(j)(1) of the Act.
MARAD cannot alter the time period established by Congress for review by the Secretary of Defense or otherwise expand
or contract that Secretary's authority. It is, of course, clear that the Secretary of Defense may only disapprove
a loan Guarantee based on an assessment of ``the potential use of the Vessel in a manner that may cause harm to the United
States national security interests.'' 

Id.

 MARAD concurs, however, with the comment that the third reference in the second sentence of paragraph (a) to the Secretary
should include the words ``of Defense'' and has so modified that sentence in the final rule. 
MARAD concurs with the suggestion that it should clarify that vessels under 5,000 gross tons can be financed as Eligible
Export Vessels with funds provided by appropriations to the Department of Transportation instead of funds provided
by the Department of Defense. MARAD believes that it should exercise the broadest possible flexibility to assure
that U.S. yards can be stimulated to engage in international commerce effectively. MARAD also believes that it may,
in fact, be very reasonable to finance smaller, ``niche'' vessels, and is acting to preserve its authority to do so.
Problems of administering the monies from two different sources are negligible.

The objection of numerous commenters to the language of paragraph (b)(3) as it applies to the creditworthiness of
``the country to which the Vessel is to be exported'' is, in part, well taken. Some Vessel owners will document their
Vessel under a flag of convenience that bears no commercial relationship to the country in which the shipowner or charterer
has its principal place of business. Of course, MARAD, as mortgagee, is concerned about the enforceability of its
security interests in the various jurisdictions involved in the business plan of the Vessel, including the enforceability
of a mortgage under a flag of convenience. However, the country of the ship's documentation is not the issue here. The
problems intended to be addressed by paragraph (b)(3) deal with the creditworthiness of the country in which the shipowner
and its charterers have their chief executive offices and have located a substantial portion of their assets. It is
in those places where MARAD will have to enforce deficiency judgments or pursue enforcement of Guarantees. Among
other things, these problems of enforcement include (1) the convertibility and the stability of currency from the
shipowner's or the applicable (bareboat or time) charterers' countries, (2) the likelihood of political violence,
expropriation, and government sanctioned repudiation of contracts, (3) the ability to enforce contract rights
in the juridical systems of the shipowner's and charterers' countries, (4) the likelihood that MARAD could enforce
sovereign and corporate guarantees, (5) the existence of acceptable lien filing and bankruptcy systems, and (6)
the stability of the banking systems. Accordingly, MARAD has revised paragraph (b)(3) to state that ``Such Guarantee
shall not be approved unless the Secretary determines that the countries in which the shipowner, its charterers,
guarantors, or other financial interests, if any, supporting the proposed transaction have their chief executive
offices or have located a substantial portion of their assets, present an acceptable financial or legal risk to MARAD's
collateral interests.'' 


Section 298.20 Term, Redemption and Interest Rates


Several shipyards and other commenters proposed that the Secretary should make liberal use of the maximum 25-year
duration for Guarantees in paragraph (a), and should disregard the provisions in the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development's (OECD) Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits that preclude financing
for more than 80 percent of the contract price of a Vessel and restrict financing to a maximum of eight and a half years
at a minimum interest rate of 8 percent. 
Paragraph (c), 

Interest rate,

 was amended in the interim final rule to allow the Secretary discretion with respect to Guarantees for all transactions
other than those for U.S.-flag Vessels owned by U.S. citizens. Two commenters objected to the requirement that interest
rates for U.S. Vessels must be ``reasonable'' while there is no such requirement for non-U.S. Vessels. One of the commenters
observed that while the intention of the legislation was to assist the shipbuilders, the specifics are offensive
when foreign owners are granted preferences by the regulation. Another of the commenters stated that there is no statutory
basis for Secretarial discretion with regard to interest rates for transactions other than for U.S. owned Vessels
that is similar to the discretion that exists in section 298.39 of the interim regulations. That regulation is based
on section 1111(a)(2) of the Act, as amended by the Shipbuilding Act, allowing the Secretary to meet export credit
terms of foreign governments. Therefore, it was submitted that the provision granting discretion in setting interest
rates should be eliminated. 
One commenter noted that the word ``rates'' appears to be missing after the words ``. . . taking into
account the range of interest . . .''. The commenter suggested that, at the end of the paragraph, the
words ``with respect to each application'' be deleted and the words ``. . . with respect to the Obligations
to be guaranteed'' be substituted therefor. 
MARAD Response: In issuing loan Guarantees pursuant to section 1111(a), MARAD is not subject to the OECD guidelines.
Among other reasons, the U.S. is not a party to the OECD Understanding On Export Credits For Ships and, further, Congress
intended MARAD to issue its Eligible Export Vessel Guarantees according to the same terms and principles it applies
in the domestic program. MARAD notes that an OECD agreement on shipbuilding subsidies was negotiated on July 17, 1994,
and still must be ratified by all parties thereto. If and when this OECD agreement on shipbuilding subsidies goes into
force, the terms of the Title XI program will be modified to conform. In the meantime, applicants shall be required
to demonstrate their qualifications for the current loan Guarantee program, on the basis of their creditworthiness,
the economic soundness of their proposed project and the value of the proposed collateral. 
MARAD agrees that there is an unnecessary appearance of unjustified preference in the way interest rates could be
approved for the various programs and MARAD has removed in the final rule the last sentence of paragraph (c) as requested.
MARAD has also inserted the word ``rates,'' after the words ``taking into account the range of interest,'' in that
paragraph (c).

Paragraph (a), 

Actual Cost basis, 

was amended in the interim final rule to include reference to AST/MST and to add new paragraphs (14) and (15) which,
respectively, disallow payments for early equipment delivery or non-capitalizable pre-delivery expenses for
such technology. Paragraph (b), 

Actual Cost items, 

sets forth the items which comprise Actual Cost. One commenter advised that the citations to the Act in paragraph (a)
should be corrected to ``Section 1104A(b)(2) or 1104B(b)(2)'' and ``Section 1103(A)(a)(5)''. 

With regard to paragraph (b), Inclusion of owner furnished equipment in Actual Cost Determination, one commenter
stated that it is appropriate to include as part of Actual Cost items the cost of owner supplied facilities that are
part of AST/MST, such as land, buildings, drydocks, piers, etc., and the cost of upgrading, renovating, refurbishing,
and relocating such facilities. The rationale is that such items play a role in construction of AST/MST that is as important
as owner-furnished equipment in the construction of a vessel and that the value assigned to such items should be fair
market value or a percentage thereof. Several shipyards commented that, to the extent that the regulations do not
follow Cost Accounting Standard 404 relating to tangible capital assets constructed by a contractor for its own use,
they should be amended to do so in order to permit the inclusion of indirect costs in the calculation of Actual Cost,


i.e., 

general and administrative expense when in-house construction requires planning, supervisory, or other significant
effort by officers or other personnel whose salaries are charged to G&A expenses. 

With respect to new paragraph (b)(14), some commenters urged that the concept of including payments for early delivery
of a Vessel or AST/MST should be reconsidered since there is clear economic value in many cases for receiving early
delivery, and speed in producing the end result should be encouraged and not discouraged. This is especially true
when the need is considered for U.S. shipyards to accelerate their delivery schedules to compete more effectively
with foreign yards. 

MARAD Response: The references in paragraph (a) will be corrected to read ``section 1104A(b)(2) or 1104B(b)(2)''
and ``section 1103A(a)(5),'' respectively. Extending the Guarantee to land, buildings, and other preexisting
facilities is not accepted, as MARAD has limited resources to finance the AST/MST vessel projects. 

Moreover, as a general practice, MARAD has disallowed the inclusion of indirect costs in the calculation of Actual
Cost. MARAD's appropriated funds are available for the direct costs of constructing the asset; the inclusion of indirect
costs carries with it the potential for unjustified inflation of the Actual Cost to the detriment of the taxpayer and
the program. MARAD has not financed the payment of premiums for early delivery of Vessels because these costs do not
add to the value of the collateral and, in any event, the value of the premium should be recoverable by the shipowner
as profit arising from its operations. 

 Consistent with the amendments to sections 298.11(a), concerning U.S. construction, and 298.13(a)(2)(i) with
respect to Actual Cost, MARAD has also adopted a specific, explicit exclusion of the cost of such foreign components
of the hull and superstructure, and the cost of their foreign assembly, in a new paragraph (c)(16) of section 298.21.




Section 298.23  Refinancing



The section was amended in the interim final rule to provide that refinancing of Title XI debt only shall be permitted
for AST/MST. One commenter noted that the refinancing limitation with respect to technology is not imposed by statute
and that refinancing of recently incurred debt should be allowed. Several shipyards commented that the provision
regarding technology is too restrictive because it would preclude the refinancing of a ``bridge loan'' incurred
prior to the receipt of Title XI financing. 

MARAD Response: MARAD is of the opinion that it is not sound policy to use a Government Guarantee to refinance existing
shipyard debt. As a matter of administrative discretion, MARAD has decided to use its limited funds for the development
and use of new technology by U.S. shipyards not previously privately financed and for Vessel projects. On the other
hand, the refinancing of Title XI debt at a lower interest rate benefits all participants, thereby reducing the government's
exposure under the guaranteed obligations. To clarify, however, that the whole of section 298.23 applies to the refinancing
of AST/MST, the final rule has been amended by inserting the words ``or Advanced or Modern Shipbuilding Technology'',
where appropriate, in section 298.23. 



Section 298.31  Mortgage



Paragraph (a), 

In general, 

was amended in the interim final rule to include a provision for evidence of the Secretary's security interest in AST/MST,
which may be a form of security other than a Mortgage. That paragraph also requires, with respect to a foreign Mortgage
for Eligible Export Vessels, that to ensure the validity and worldwide enforceability of such Mortgages, the Secretary
will require the Obligor to obtain satisfactory legal opinions from foreign counsel. One commenter stated that it
is not clear whether a security interest that is not a Mortgage can be used as satisfactory evidence for the Secretary.
The commenter suggested that MARAD specifically provide for the use of security interests, in addition to Mortgages,
in its program for Eligible Export Vessels. The commenter argued that MARAD should specifically allow this type of
transaction and should not rely on the ``Exemptions'' provision in the regulations to permit other financing structures.

Many commenters objected to the requirement for legal opinions as to the worldwide enforceability of Mortgages because,
generally, no lawyer is able to give an opinion on the law with respect to any jurisdiction other than that in which the
lawyer is admitted to practice. Furthermore, it was stated that there are some jurisdictions where Mortgages cannot
be enforced as a practical matter. The commenters noted that this requirement adds an additional cost to a transaction
that needs to be financially competitive with non-U.S. financing alternatives. Several commenters stated that
in-house counsel should be permitted to render opinions and that such practice is commercially acceptable. One commenter
noted that the focus should be on the country in which the Vessel is registered and the country where the owner has its
principal place of business. 

Another commenter argued that the Secretary should be authorized to accept various types of collateral (

i.e., 

land, buildings, equipment) or a collateral package (

i.e., 

a combination of first and second Mortgages, assignments, etc.) for Title XI financing. 

One commenter questioned whether it would be practical for the Secretary to promulgate a standard mortgage for each
country, because there are so many differences from country to country. Another commenter suggested that there are
some countries where the Secretary may not, by law, be a mortgagee and proposed that the regulation be amended to permit
the Secretary to appoint or designate an authorized and eligible mortgagee to act on the Secretary's behalf. The comment
does not cite any examples. 

MARAD Response: The regulations provide that ``Under normal circumstances, a Guarantee shall not be endorsed on
any Obligation until the Secretary receives satisfactory evidence of a security interest in one or more Vessels . . . .''
See section 298.31(a). The existing regulations also specifically provide that ``In the case where a Mortgage or
a security interest on the financed assets may not be available or enforceable, the Secretary shall require alternative
forms of security.'' Therefore, the existing regulations provide flexibility to accept collateral other than ship
Mortgages and in unusual circumstances, for example, where a Mortgage is not available in a foreign jurisdiction
for a delivered Vessel, MARAD could accept another type of security interest. No amendment to the regulation is necessary
in this connection. 

The hallmark of a ship Mortgage is that, once foreclosed upon in admiralty court in an 

in rem 

proceeding, the admiralty order transferring possession free and clear of all liens is valid against the whole world.
The reference in section (a) was to this type of ``worldwide enforceability.'' Understandably, there are countries
which do not afford this comity and international recognition of judgments, particularly those countries which
do not have admiralty courts. Taking into account the objections raised to the term ``worldwide enforceability''
and the potentially burdensome legal costs entailed in such an opinion, MARAD has amended this provision to require
an enforceability opinion only (1) As to the country in which the vessel is documented, (2) the United States, and (3),
in the case of dedicated service (over specified trade routes), the country or countries involved in this service,
or if those destinations are too numerous in MARAD's opinion, then only in the Vessel's primary port of operation.


After much deliberation, MARAD has decided not to accept the suggestion that legal opinions be issued by in-house
counsel. It has long been a MARAD precondition for the issuance of a Guarantee that an applicant retain outside, independent
legal counsel, who are acceptable to MARAD, to issue such a legal opinion to MARAD. Counsel are required to opine, among
other things, that the documents comprising the guaranteed transaction have been duly authorized, executed, and
delivered and constitute the valid, legally binding, and enforceable obligations of the Obligor and other Related
Parties. We note that other government agencies, most notably the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import
Bank, when engaged in similar commercial transactions, require that the applicants pay for an attorney to advise
the agency in addition to any that they may employ for themselves. 

With respect to the argument that the Secretary should be authorized to accept various types of collateral, including
land and equipment, second mortgages, assignments, etc., MARAD notes that section 298.31(c) already states that
if it is determined that a Mortgage on a financed Vessel or AST/MST is not sufficient, then the Secretary ``may require
additional collateral, such as mortgage(s) on other . . . assets, special escrow funds, pledges of
stock, charters, contracts, notes, letters of credit, accounts receivable, assignments, and guarantees.'' No
amendment to the rule is necessary to preserve this discretion, which the Secretary has consistently exercised over
the life of the Title XI program. 

In response to the query whether it would be practical for MARAD to promulgate a standard Mortgage for each country,
it should be stated that MARAD has no intention of proposing a standard foreign mortgage. MARAD may, however, over
time compile a list of jurisdictions that have satisfactory mortgage laws. 

Finally, with respect to jurisdictions where the Secretary may not, as a matter of law, be a mortgagee, MARAD will not
issue a loan Guarantee, unless some other acceptable form of security can be provided.

Section 298.32 Required Provisions in Documentation


Paragraph (a)(1) was amended in the interim final rule to provide for the furnishing of satisfactory insurance or
a performance bond by the manufacturer of AST/MST. Several shipyards commented that a performance bond is not necessary
where the manufacture of AST/MST is concerned because the manufacturers are merely suppliers of goods and services.
The proscription against work done outside the shipyard contained in paragraph (a)(5) was not within the scope of
the interim final rule, but several shipyards have requested that MARAD amend the provision to remove the prohibition
against the use of Title XI proceeds for payment of work done outside the shipyard unless the Secretary consents in
writing to such use. It was suggested that such language is probably unintentionally too restrictive and should be
modified by adding, ``except for customary and usual subcontractor or supplier off-site prefabrication or fabrication
of components where considered appropriate for cost or risk containment purposes.'' 
Several shipyards have requested that MARAD amend paragraph (a)(6), which requires that materials and supplies
of the United States be used, to delete this remnant of the former ``Buy American'' requirement in section 298.11,
which was amended in 1986.
With respect to paragraph (b)(4), which prescribes covenants by shipowners, including citizenship requirements
that were amended in the interim final rule to exclude Eligible Export Vessels from compliance, one commenter suggested
that the word ``registry'' is confusing in that while the term is common for documentation of foreign vessels in foreign
countries, it is a confusing term when used for documentation of a vessel under the laws of the United States. The commenter
suggested substituting for the term ``registry'', the term ``documentation'', to correct the confusion. In addition,
another commenter suggested that ``compliance with the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 31301-31343'', is inappropriate
with regard to Eligible Export Vessels and reference to them should be stricken. 
MARAD received several comments by shipyards about paragraph (b)(8) that requires the Obligor to maintain insurance
on Title XI assets, suggesting the regulation be amended to allow shipyards to self-insure if those shipyards can
demonstrate their financial well-being to the satisfaction of the Secretary. Paragraph (b)(9) requires covenants
for Eligible Export Vessels to maintain additional types of insurance as may be required against such risks as those
of a political, financial, or economic nature, to reflect any risk of the foreign country associated with the shipowner.
One commenter expressed concern that compliance with this regulation may be impossible because the Vessel may be
purchased by one foreign national, sold to another foreign national, and flagged yet in another country. 
MARAD Response: MARAD believes that paragraph (a)(1) is written with sufficient qualifications to ensure that,
in a proper case, MARAD will not require a performance bond. In the case of mere suppliers of goods that need not be specially
constructed to meet the shipyard's specifications, a performance bond would not be required. Accordingly, MARAD
has not found it necessary to amend the regulation further to achieve this result.
With respect to paragraph (a)(5), concerning the constraints on work done outside the shipyard, the commenters misapprehend
MARAD's practice. MARAD merely needs to be aware of offsite prefabrication or fabrication practices; MARAD does
not discourage that practice. The requirement for written approval has not posed a problem for other projects and
it is not anticipated to pose a problem.
The Buy American issue concerning paragraphs (a)(6) and (b)(5)(ii) were addressed earlier in the discussion concerning
section 298.13. Accordingly, those provisions have been amended. 
As to paragraph (b)(4), MARAD agrees with the commenter who suggested that Eligible Export Vessels should not be required
to comply with the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 31301-31343, Commercial Instruments and Maritime Liens. Instead,
the regulation has been amended to state that the Obligor shall covenant with the Secretary that the Mortgage on its
Eligible Export Vessel shall comply with the definition of a ``preferred mortgage'' under 46 U.S.C. 31301(6)(B),
to wit, it shall comply with the mortgage laws of the foreign country where the Vessel is documented and shall have been
registered under those laws in a public register. In addition, paragraph (b)(4) has been modified to state the requirement
for ``maintaining United States documentation of the Vessel or documentation under the laws of a country other than
the United States with regard to an Eligible Export vessel'', instead of ``registry'' of the Vessel.
Insurance of the Title XI assets is a critical and essential part of the Title XI program. Self-insurance by shipyards
as to its collateral is considered by MARAD to be unduly risky. Finally, MARAD does not agree that compliance with the
provisions of section (b)(9) on certain insurance for Eligible Export Vessels is ``impossible.'' In domestic Title
XI projects, such insurance has been procured. The requirement is not invalidated by the possibility of subsequent
transfer of the Vessel because such transfer requires MARAD's prior consent. MARAD's consent will not be given unless
the proposed purchaser agrees, among other things, to obtain the required insurance.

Section 298.34 Construction Fund




Paragraph (b) was amended to include disbursements from the construction fund prior to delivery of the AST/MST. Several
shipyards have suggested that in the international market place, the shipowner may, at its own risk, contract with
the shipyard for construction prior to obtaining the loan or loan Guarantee, and pay for the initial stages of construction
with the required 12.5 percent equity (87.5 percent Guarantee) or the 25 percent equity contribution (75 percent
Guarantee) at that time. Thereafter, once the Secretary has authorized its commitment, such equity expenditures
would be credited as the equity contribution. Thus, it was proposed that section 298.34 should be amended to authorize
such interpretation of equity contribution. 
MARAD Response: The proposed practice is consistent with those that MARAD follows under the regulation as drafted,
and no additional amendments in this respect are necessary. 



Section 298.35 Reserve Fund and Financial Agreement 



Several shipyard commenters have stated that there is a need for clarification of the calculation to determine the
amount of required deposits into the Reserve Fund because existing regulations do not provide a shipyard with enough
facts to make an informed decision with respect to the total cost of Title XI financing. In addition, the Reserve Fund
deposit requirements, as written, do not address how net operating revenue will be determined in conjunction with
the shipyards' AST/MST assets. 
MARAD Response: MARAD agrees and has amended Section 298.35 to provide for a simple calculation of net income deposits
into the shipyard's Title XI Reserve Fund. Such calculation will be set at 2 percent of net cash flow, as defined by GAAP,
and as shown on its audited financial statements. 


Section 298.36 Annual Guarantee Fee



Several shipyard commenters have suggested that MARAD waive the Guarantee Fee if the interest provided for under
Title XI is greater than that provided for overseas under OECD financing in order to meet international competitiveness.

MARAD Response: The Secretary has no authority to waive the statutorily-required Guarantee Fee. On the other hand,
MARAD has authority to match export credit terms offered by foreign governments if those offered are more favorable
than under Title XI. To date, MARAD has not had occasion to exercise that authority. 


Section 298.39 Exemptions



Several shipyards have suggested that MARAD needs to codify specific guidelines for exemptions from its regulations,
and the following standards should be added to allow greater flexibility: MARAD (1) Should waive Guarantee and investigation
fees where foreign shipyards do not charge fees, or allow the applicant to include such in its actual costs; (2) extend
the life of the Guarantee beyond 25 years; (3) authorize the inclusion of legal and accounting costs in Actual Cost;
(4) and finance more than 87.5 percent of the Actual Cost. In addition, it was stated that the phrase ``not required
by law'' in the first paragraph of the section is ambiguous since the statute specifically authorizes waiver of statutory
requirements, and it should be deleted for this reason. Commenters further suggested that MARAD should have the flexibility
to provide for waivers when, in the judgment of MARAD, a waiver (1) Is required to provide effective assistance to U.S.
shipyards in competing in the global market; (2) is not inconsistent with law; and (3) will not unduly affect the financial
interests of the United States, given the objectives of the program. 
MARAD Response: MARAD declines to adopt these proposals 
as unnecessarily diluting the force and effect of the regulation. The exemptions are not intended to address MARAD
authority under section 1111(a) of the Act to provide more favorable terms than specified by Title XI in order to be
compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments. Any exercise of such authority will be on a case-by-case-basis.

Section 298.42 Reporting Requirements_Financial Statements



Several shipyards have suggested that since they are wholly owned subsidiaries and are included in the general audit
of the parent corporation, MARAD should accept such audits because independent audits could be too costly to conduct
for the shipyards.

MARAD Response: The regulation already preserves the discretion of MARAD to allow the submission of consolidated
audits in an appropriate case and no amendment of the regulation is necessary to accommodate the commenter's request.



Rulemaking Analyses and Notices



Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Other Requirements of Law



This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866, and it has been determined that it is a significant
regulatory action since it is likely to result in a rule that may have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more. It has also been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.
Final Regulatory Assessments have been prepared and are available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under 

ADDRESSES. 

In summary, the Final Regulatory Assessments finds that the cost of the Title XI program over the first two years is
$144 million, resulting in an average annual cost of $72.0 million. Assuming that there is demand for maximum guarantees
and guarantees will range from 70 percent to 871/2 percent of actual cost of the vessel and shipyard modernization
and improvement projects, the value of the vessels, capital goods and other assets produced over the first two years
of the program will be about $1.85 billion. Further, it is estimated that new Title XI guarantees could generate 19,440
worker years of employment for U.S. shipyard workers, which translates into employment for 9,720 workers over a period
of two years.

This rulemaking document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory
Planning and Review.''



Federalism



MARAD has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that these regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



MARAD certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.



Environmental Assessment



MARAD has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and has concluded that an environmental impact
statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule; extension of effectiveness. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 An emergency interim rule is in effect through September 26, 1994, to prohibit all taking of live rock in the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states (South Atlantic) north of Dade County, FL; to prohibit the taking
of live rock by chipping in the South Atlantic EEZ; and to limit the harvest of live rock from the South Atlantic EEZ in
1994 to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). At the request of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council),
NMFS extends the emergency interim rule for an additional 90 days because conditions justifying the emergency action
remain unchanged. The intended effect is to continue protection of live rock resources and fishery habitat in the
South Atlantic until a permanent rule is approved and implemented.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Coral and coral reefs in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico EEZ are managed under the Fishery Management Plan for
Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South
Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 


Under sections 305(c)(2)(B) and (c)(3) of the Magnuson Act, NMFS published an emergency interim rule (59 FR 32938,
June 27, 1994) effective for 90 days (June 27 through September 26, 1994) to: (1) Prohibit all taking of live rock in
the South Atlantic EEZ from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida, (2)
prohibit chipping of live rock in the South Atlantic EEZ from the Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf
of Mexico boundary, and (3) limit the harvest of live rock in 1994 from the South Atlantic EEZ to 485,000 lb (219,992
kg). 
The South Atlantic Council requested an extension of the emergency interim rule because conditions justifying the
emergency action remain unchanged and to prevent a lapse in these management measures while NMFS considers approval
of Amendment 2 to the FMP. Amendment 2 would implement the emergency measures on a permanent basis. NMFS concurs and
extends the emergency interim rule through December 25, 1994, in accordance with section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson
Act. 
Details concerning the basis for this action and the classification of the rulemaking are contained in the initial
emergency interim rule and are not repeated here.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule adopts new and revised airworthiness standards by incorporating optional one-engine-inoperative (OEI)
power ratings for multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft. These amendments result from a petition for rulemaking
from Aerospace Industries Association of America (AIA) and the recognition by both government and industry that
additional OEI power rating standards are needed. These amendments enhance rotorcraft safety after an engine failure
or precautionary shutdown by providing higher OEI power, when necessary. These amendments also assure that the drive
system will maintain its structural integrity and allow continued safe flight while operating at the new OEI power
ratings with the operable engine(s).

By letter dated September 20, 1984, the AIA petitioned for rulemaking by requesting amendments to Parts 1, 27, 29,
and 33 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to establish new 30-second, 2-minute, and continuous OEI power ratings.

In the process of drafting the amendments, numerous meetings were held with the industry groups and airworthiness
authorities of other countries in an attempt to identify and address all of the issues. As set forth in the AIA's petition,
only multiengine rotorcraft, with turbine-powered engines, would be eligible for these new OEI power ratings which
would be applicable to the remaining engine(s) only after an in-flight failure or precautionary engine shutdown.
The rated 30-second OEI power would be limited to periods of not more than 30 seconds at any one time and would enhance
the OEI performance of the rotorcraft during the transient phase of the takeoff and landing maneuvers. The rated 2-minute
OEI power would be limited to periods of not more than 2 minutes at any one time and would achieve initial stabilized
climb of at least 100 feet per minute following takeoff or balked landing flight with one engine inoperative. These
ratings could be used instead of the existing 21/2-minute OEI power rating or normal takeoff power.

The continuous OEI power rating and all aspects of its definition, eligibility, qualification, and performance
credit were adopted in Amendments 1-34, 27-23, 29-26, and 33-12, Rotorcraft Regulatory Review
Program Amendment No. 3 (53 FR 34198, September 2, 1988).

This final rule is based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 89-26 that was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 22, 1989 (54 FR 39086). A corresponding NPRM, Notice No. 89-27, that proposed changes to parts 1
and 33 for definitions and engines was also published in the same issue of the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 39080). In addition, a joint public meeting was held on November 16, 1989, in Forth Worth, Texas, to discuss both
notices (54 FR 41986).

All interested persons have been given an opportunity to participate in this rulemaking and due consideration has
been given to all matters presented. Some minor editorial changes have been made to clarify the proposals. The changes
are based on comments received and further FAA review of the proposals. Except as indicated herein, the proposals
contained in the notice have been adopted without change.



Discussion of Comments



The commenters represented airframe manufacturers, airworthiness authorities from other countries, rotorcraft
owners and operators, and private individuals. The commenters generally agree with the substance of the proposal
with certain recommended changes. The following discussion addresses these recommendations and their disposition.



Sections 27.923 and 29.923 Rotor Drive System and Control Mechanism Tests



The notice proposed changes to   27.923(e) and 29.923 (a) and (b) that add the special tests to the rotor
drive system endurance test schedule, which are necessary to qualify the rotor drive system for the new 30-second/2-minute
OEI power ratings.

One commenter, referring to   27.923(e)(2)(i) and 29.923(e)(3)(i), states that if the 5-minute takeoff
power run to qualify the drive system is conducted as part of the endurance run, and the 30-second/2-minute OEI requirements
are conducted on a bench test, then the takeoff power 5-minute run will be conducted twice on the same set of gears. The
commenter proposes that the wording for the bench testing requirements be changed to state ``* * *
following stabilization at takeoff power.'' The FAA does not intend to duplicate the takeoff power 5-minute run and
agrees that clarification is needed; therefore, the recommended change has been incorporated.

Another commenter recommends doubling the test time in  29.923(b)(3)(i) because the drive system, at the higher
and potentially more damaging 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings, will be substantiated by less endurance testing
at these new powers. This recommendation is beyond the scope of the notice. Further, the FAA disagrees with the recommendation
to double the test time for drive system substantiation because the test time proposed for the new 30-second/2-minute
OEI power ratings is more severe than the current OEI ratings, when considering expected usage. The test time was established
based upon the proportionate duration of load applications during these test runs when compared with the expected
service life of the rotor drive system. In addition, the test time was also based upon the statistical failure rate
of turboshaft engines and three applications of 30-second/2-minute OEI power during the expected life of the drive
system. The relationship between test time and anticipated OEI exposure in service is more severe by a factor of 2.64
for the new OEI ratings.

Another commenter proposes removing the words `` * * * when engine limitations either preclude repeated
use of this power or would result in premature engine removal * * *'' from   27.923(e)(2)(iii)
and 29.923(b)(3)(iii). The FAA disagrees because the preferred method of conducting the tests is on the rotorcraft
where the entire drive system is subjected to the OEI powers. Since the FAA recognizes that in some cases it may not be
possible to conduct these tests on the rotorcraft, a bench test, which is representative of the aircraft, is included
as an acceptable alternative.

Another commenter proposes to clarify   27.923(e)(2)(iii) and 29.923(b)(3)(iii) by inserting the
word ``vibration'' between the words ``the'' and ``frequency.'' The FAA agrees, and the change has been made.

Other than some minor editorial changes, these amendments are adopted as discussed.



Sections 27.1143 and 29.1143 Engine Controls



The notice proposed to include the requirement for automatic control of the 30-second OEI power in   27.1143(e)
and 29.1143(f). One commenter suggests that  29.1143(f) is ambiguous in that it does not adequately define
the meaning of ``control.'' The FAA agrees that additional clarification is necessary. The amendment now states
``* * * automatically activate and control the 30-second OEI power and prevent * * *.''
Other than this clarification, the amendments are adopted as proposed.



Sections 27.1305 and 29.1305 Powerplant Instruments



The notice proposed to include the requirements for a pilot alert and a recording device when 30-second/2-minute
OEI powers are used by adding paragraphs (t) and (u) to  27.1305 and paragraphs (a) (24) and (25) to  29.1305.

One commenter proposes to add the words ``* * * for use by ground personnel * * *'' between
the words ``provided'' and ``which'' in   27.1305(u) and 29.1305(a)(25). The FAA agrees, and the change
has been made.

Another commenter states that because of the number of warnings being introduced by  29.1305(a)(24), some
guidance material is needed. The FAA agrees and will address these concerns with forthcoming advisory material.

A third commenter suggests adding the word ``automatically'' before the word ``records'' in  29.1305(a)(25)(i).
The FAA agrees, and the amendments are adopted with the changes.



Sections 27.1521 and 29.1521 Powerplant Limitations



The notice proposed to add paragraphs (j) and (k) to  27.1521 and paragraphs (i) and (j) to  29.1521 to include
the 30-second/2-minute OEI power limitations, along with rotorcraft applicability and the conditions for their
use. One commenter supports this proposal if the amendments to Parts 1 and 33 ensure mandatory maintenance of the engine
following use of the 30-second OEI power rating. In addition, the commenter further states that the transmission
and gearbox should not be subject to mandatory maintenance. The testing requirements proposed in   27.923
and 29.923 for the 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings will minimize the need for mandatory maintenance of the transmission
and gearbox following application of the 30-second/2-minute OEI power in service. The amendments, which concern
the airframe requirements, are adopted without change.



Sections 27.1549 and 29.1549 Powerplant Instruments



The notice proposed to revise   27.1549(e) and 29.1549(e) by defining the instrument markings associated
with the 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings. One commenter supports the proposal and suggests that some guidance
material is needed. The FAA agrees, and guidance material will be developed. These amendments are adopted as proposed.



Section 29.67 Climb: One Engine Inoperative



The notice proposed to revise paragraph (a)(1)(i) to specify that for rotorcraft certificated for the 30-second/2-minute
OEI power, only 2-minute OEI power may be used to comply with the 100-foot-per-minute rate of climb required by this
section.

One commenter supports the proposal. Another comment concerns paragraphs (a)(2) and (b), which are not changed by
this rulemaking. It is noted that OEI climb performance required by the current rules can be determined by using either
30-minute or continuous OEI power. There are no restrictions on which long duration OEI power rating may be used with
the short duration 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings. OEI climb performance will be based upon the highest long
duration OEI power for which certification is requested.

The amendment is adopted without change.



Additional Discussion



Training



Although outside the scope of this rulemaking, the FAA has recognized the need for additional training for flight
crewmembers in the correct procedures and use of these new OEI power ratings. A commenter notes that the use of these
new ratings could result in serious damage to the operating engine and that additional training must be available
to satisfy the operational and airworthiness needs. The FAA agrees, and these training procedures will be considered
by operations specialists during the certification process.

Power Assurance


A commenter notes that power assurance requirements, as given in   27.45(f) and 29.45(f), will be affected
by these amendments and recommends the issuance of guidance material. The FAA recognizes the importance of the power
assurance requirement for approval and use of these new OEI power ratings, and appropriate guidance material will
be developed.


Limiting Height-Speed Envelope


One commenter asks whether the 30-second power is the ``greatest power for which certification is requested'' as
currently contained in   27.79(b)(2) and 29.79(b)(1). For these amendments, 30-second power is the
greatest power for which certification could be accomplished.


Airworthiness Limitations Section


One commenter addressed the need for changes to Appendix A33.4, Airworthiness Limitations Section. Since this comment
addresses part 33, it will be handled in the rulemaking effort underway addressing that part.


Regulatory Evaluation Summary


Regulatory Evaluation


This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides more detailed estimates
of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent
practicable, estimated costs to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, State and local governments, as well
as anticipated benefits.
Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.
Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine if the rules constitute ``significant regulatory action.'' ``Significant regulatory
action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,
the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. ``Significant regulatory action'' is submitted to centralized regulatory
review by OIRA.
OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not ``a significant regulatory action.'' However, a cost-benefit
analysis, including evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule has been prepared. This analysis also
contains the regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and a Trade Impact
Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full evaluation contained
in the docket.


Economic Evaluation


The use of the new optional rating structure will provide significant benefits to operators of Category A helicopters.
Category A helicopters are multiengine, can withstand any single engine becoming inoperative, and can continue
safe flight or landing within a demonstrated field size. In addition to increased payloads, the amendments will enable
rotorcraft operators to operate from significantly smaller heliports with the same degree of safety because of the
decrease in the minimum required rejected takeoff distance for Category A operations. The rejected takeoff distance
is the distance from the start of the takeoff to the stopping point after landing. The current regulation puts operators
using shorter fields at a disadvantage because of the inability to satisfy Category A operational requirements.
This increased operational flexibility should enable them to fly Category A operations and possibly use more efficient
and profitable route structures (where larger fields are not available).
The rule establishes OEI ratings for periods of shorter duration than previously allowed and will provide an additional
optional capability to manufacturers. The testing costs associated with obtaining these ratings should be viewed
as the price of an additional capability and will be evaluated by the individual rotorcraft manufacturers based on
market potential. The principal operational benefit of these new optional ratings is the ability to carry higher
payloads from existing fields or to takeoff from smaller fields with current payloads. The AIA estimates that the
use of the new rating structure for a given Category A mission could result in an increase in productivity of 48 percent
for a 37,000-pound design gross weight (DGW) helicopter, and up to 125 percent for a 7,500-pound DGW helicopter if
operators who fly only Category A missions choose to take full advantage of the increase in payload that will be permitted.
The AIA further notes that the public will also benefit from these changes because the availability of viable, short-field
performance should encourage the development of downtown heliports, thereby enhancing convenience.
For a manufacturer considering a new design, the issue of whether to design a helicopter to accommodate engines capable
of satisfying the new OEI rating scheme (use of the new ratings will affect helicopter performance standards as well
as the structural and drive system requirements) will be influenced by the following factors:
 The availability of appropriately sized engines (larger helicopters designed for Category A use will be able
to use a smaller engine).
 The OEI capability of competitive products.
 The operator mission requirements.
 The cost (for increased testing and increased engine performance) of obtaining the new OEI capability compared
to the benefit derived from the increase in payload or flexibility of route structures afforded by this capability.
The availability of the new OEI capability could provide substantial benefits to rotorcraft manufacturers and operators.
However, such benefits are difficult to quantify because the number of products certificated to this standard cannot
be estimated. In addition, the specific increase in dispatch payload cannot be estimated because it will depend on
the specific rotorcraft design in relation to the engines that will be available. These optional ratings should enhance
the ability of operators who are limited by current regulations to Category B operations, because of the small size
fields they use to fly more Category A operations, which should improve their profitability. The extent of these benefits
cannot be predicted since they will depend, to a large degree, on the mix of Category A and B operations that are chosen.
The FAA has not been able to quantify these potential benefits either on a per-unit or industry-wide scale due to the
changes in rotorcraft design and performance that these optional ratings could promote and the large number of highly
variable factors that would influence the magnitude of the overall benefits. The FAA concludes that the optional
OEI ratings will not have a negative impact on manufacturers or operators. Since these ratings are optional, manufacturers
will provide this capability only if the additional costs can be recovered in the market place.
The FAA maintains that, after an engine failure under the revised regulations for limited-use ratings, safety will
be at least equivalent to operational safety under the previous regulations. This condition is supported by the fact
that these 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings are ``limited use/mandatory inspection ratings.'' Following one
mission cycle of rating use, specific requirements for inspection will have to be met to verify continued airworthiness
of the engine. Under current regulations, there is no requirement for an inspection following an OEI power application.
Any rotorcraft parts found to be unsuitable for further use must be replaced after application of these ratings. As
a result of new test and analysis requirements, a high level of safety will be maintained.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The FAA's criteria for a small aircraft
manufacturer is one employing fewer than 75 employees. A substantial number is a number that is not fewer than 11 and
is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the rule. A significant impact is one having an annual cost of
more than $14,900 (1987 dollars) per manufacturer.

A review of domestic helicopter manufacturing companies indicates that there are fewer than eleven small helicopter
manufacturers. Therefore, the amendments to Parts 27 and 29 will not affect a substantial number of small entities.



Trade Impact Analysis



The rule changes will have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries and foreign
firms doing business in the United States. In the U.S. market, foreign manufacturers will have the option of designing
engines and helicopters capable of satisfying the new OEI ratings and, therefore, will not be at a competitive disadvantage
with U.S. manufacturers. Because of the large U.S. market, foreign manufacturers are likely to certificate their
rotorcraft to U.S. rules, which will limit any competitive advantage U.S. manufacturers might gain in foreign markets.



Federalism Implications



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that these amendments do not have a significant economic
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. These amendments are considered nonsignificant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 CFR 11034;
February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluation of the amendments, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified

9. Section 29.923 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b)(1); and by adding paragraph (b)(3)
to read as follows:



 29.923

 Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.



(a) 

Endurance tests, general.

 Each rotor drive system and rotor control mechanism must be tested, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) through (n) of
this section, for at least 200 hours plus the time required to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3),
and (k) of this section. These tests must be conducted as follows:

(1) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the takeoff torque run must consist of 1 hour
of alternate runs of 5 minutes at takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque, and 5 minutes at as
low an engine idle speed as practicable. The engine must be declutched from the rotor drive system, and the rotor brake,
if furnished and so intended, must be applied during the first minute of the idle run. During the remaining 4 minutes
of the idle run, the clutch must be engaged so that the engine drives the rotors at the minimum practical r.p.m. The engine
and the rotor drive system must be accelerated at the maximum rate. When declutching the engine, it must be decelerated
rapidly enough to allow the operation of the overrunning clutch.



* * * * *



(3) For multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft for which the use of 30-second/2-minute OEI power is requested,
the takeoff run must be conducted as prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section except for the following:

(i) Immediately following any one 5-minute power-on run required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each power
source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI
power to the remaining affected drive system power i
