<DOCTITLE>Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China: Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of termination of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On January 18, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of the antidumping
duty order on ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China covering the period December 1, 1992 through November
30, 1993. We are now terminating that review.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 29, 1993, Lasko Metal Products, Inc. (Lasko), the petitioner, requested that the Department conduct
an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China covering
the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On January 18, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2593) a notice of initiation of an administrative review of the order. This notice stated that we would review
eleven manufacturers/exporters covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On August 26, 1994,
Lasko requested that it be allowed to withdraw its request for a review and that the review be terminated.





Section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations states that ``the Secretary may permit a party that requests
a review under paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication
of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides
that it is reasonable to do so.'' Because no significant work has yet been done in this review, we have determined that
it is reasonable to extend the 90-day time limit and to allow Lasko to withdraw its request for review. 

See Steel Wire Rope From Japan; Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews,

 56 FR 41118 (August 19, 1991). Furthermore, we note that no interested party objected to termination of the review.
Accordingly, the Department is terminating this review.

This notice serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility
concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with section 353.34(d) of
the Department's regulations. Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion
to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is
a sanctionable violation.

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice is in accordance with section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)(5)).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minority Business Development Agency, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications to operate its Tulsa Minority Business Development Center (MBDC). 


The purpose of the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to
help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
The MBDC will provide service in the Tulsa Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 06-10-95003-01.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $29,846 in non-federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. 
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business. 
Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

Pre-Award Costs


Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own

there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.
Award under this program shall be subject to all Federal laws, and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies,

Award Termination


The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to

or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law.

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 13, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 25038)
of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 



Comments were received from the current contractor, which alleged that loss of the ability to provide this service
to the Government would have a severe impact on the company. First, the portion for the janitorial services that will
remain available for the current contractor to compete for if the Committee adds this service to the Procurement List
represents more than 70 percent of the value of the commenter's current contract. 

Second, the commenter, which was informed by the Government contracting activity in 1993 of its plans to divide the
service requirement in its current contract into two contracts and offer one to the Committee's program, has not held
contracts for the service for a long period, so it can not be considered to be especially dependent on contracts for
this service. For these reasons, the Committee has concluded that addition to the Pro curement List of the services
specified in this notice will not have a severe adverse impact on the commenter. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the service, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee
has determined that the service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C.
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the service to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the service. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the service to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46 -48c) in connection with the service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the Procurement List: 



Janitorial/Custodial 
Norfolk Naval Shipyard 
Portsmouth, Virginia 

for the following buildings: 1SJ, 2SJ, 3SJ, 4SJ, 6SJ, 7SJ, 8SJ, 11SJ, 12SJ, 14SJ, 19, 26SJ, 38SJ, 41 & 42SJ, 51,
59, 67, 69SJ, 79SJ, 82SJ, 89SJ, 91SJ, 94SJ, 124SJ, 164SJ, 165SJ, 166SJ, 167SJ, 168SJ, 170SJ, 171SJ, 172SJ, 174SJ,
183SJ, 185SJ, 193 & 194SJ, 201SJ, 202SJ, 203SJ, 213SJ, 217SJ, 252SJ, 277, 277SJ, Trailer 39, 41, 305SJ, 307SJ,
310, 316, 384SG, 400SJ, 491, 492, 
1439, 1480, 1500, 1502, 1503, 1510SC, 1555SJ, HSJ, M-1SJ, M-4SJ, IUSSD Trailer 1 & 2, IUSSD Guard Shack,
674SH, Trailer 1700-1 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 18, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R.
12895) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 



Comments were received through a Member of Congress from an employee of the current contractor for this service indicating
that addition of the service to the Procurement List would greatly increase the cost of the service. The commenter
also indicated that the tasks involved are dangerous for people with severe disabilities. 

The Committee is required by law to set a fair market price for each service it places on the Procurement List. Consequently,
the price the Government pays will not increase substantially beyond what it is currently paying, contrary to the
commenter's contention. 

Grounds maintenance services have long been a part of the Committee's program and have been performed by people with
severe disabilities without incident. People with severe disabilities are not assigned tasks which are not within
their capabilities. Where such tasks exist, they are performed by the non-disabled direct labor workers nonprofit
agencies are permitted to employ 
under the Committee's program. Nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program must conform to the
same occupational safety and health requirements as other Government contractors. Under these circumstances,
the Committee believes that the commenter's concerns are unfounded. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the service, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee
has determined that the service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C.
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the service to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the service. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the service to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the Procurement List: 




Grounds Maintenance, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington.


 

This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised
under those contracts.

U.S. Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of class deviation from 10 CFR 600.14(f).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, 

Deviations, 

the Department of Energy has authorized a class deviation from 10 CFR 14.(f) which requires a Federal Register Notice
for certain financial assistance awards. This deviation applies exclusively to applications received from Historically
Black Universities which will conduct pre-college summer educational programs for women and minority students.
These applications were submitted in response to a Notice of Program Interest published by the Department of Energy.


The intent of publishing notification of financial assistance awards is to foster competition and provide information
regarding subcontracting opportunities. However, a Notice of Program Interest has already served as notice to interested
applicants, and no subcontracting opportunities have been identified. Additionally, due to programmatic requirements,
it is important that awards be made as soon as possible. Therefore, the Department of Energy has determined, pursuant
to 10 CFR 600.4, that a deviation from the requirement to publish a Federal Register Notice of each such award is (1)
necessary to achieve program objectives, (2) necessary to conserve public funds.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) to the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners (NARUC), under Cooperative Agreement number DE-FC01-94RW00304. The NARUC will provide
administrative support to a Special Intergovernmental Review Panel in its charge to conduct an independent, financial
and management evaluation of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Project in Nevada. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
(P.L. 97-425), as amended by P.L. 100-203, December 22, 1987, established the Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management (OCRWM) within the DOE, and directed the office to investigate a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada,
to determine if this site is suitable for the construction of a repository for the disposal of high level nuclear waste.
Work on site characterization has been underway for several years. This work has been funded by Congressional appropriations
from a Nuclear Waste Fund to which contributions have been made by electric utility ratepayers through electric utilities
generating power from nuclear power stations. The period of performance is contemplated to be twelve (12) months
commencing on or about September 9, 1994 and ending September 8, 1995. The total estimated cost of this effort is $1,000,000
which will be provided by DOE. No cost sharing is anticipated.

Objective



This grant agreement provides financial assistance in the development of an ``Electric Utility Engineer's FGD Manual.''
This manual will provide engineers with up-to-date technical information on calcium-based FGD systems. The manual
will be most helpful to engineers who are new to the field of flue gas desulfurization, but will also be useful as a reference
guide for more experienced engineers. The manual will be a comprehensive survey of the calcium-based FGD technologies
available and will aid utilities in their purchase, operation and optimization of FGD equipment.

The information contained in this manual will be useful to the utility engineer involved in installation of an FGD
system at either a new or existing generating unit. The information presented in the manual will allow the utility
engineer to design and select an FGD system that will achieve the required SO

2

 removal efficiency; operate reliably; provide a high level of operation flexibility to change conditions; benefit
from the most recent operation experience of existing systems; and have the lowest practical capital and annual costs.

Criteria to Justify Noncompetitive Financial Assistance The award of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance is justified
pursuant to applicable criteria under 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), criterion (D).

The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique technical
expertise gained during design, specification, purchase and operation of flue gas desulfurization systems for
25 years. Radian Corporation has been involved in more than 150 FGD-related projects at 70 different power plant sites.
Radian Corporation has been involved in the production of technical guidelines and manuals covering a variety of
FGD-related topics.

Northern States Power Company; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment



September 8, 1994.




In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of license for the Chippewa Falls Hydroelectric Project, No. 2440-002.
The Chippewa Falls Hydroelectric Project is located on the Chippewa River in Chippewa County, Wisconsin. The application
is for the lowering of the reservoir 0.5 foot for 17 months for maintenance work. An Environmental Assessment (EA)
was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving the application would not constitute a major federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.

transmission line; and 

8. appurtenant facilities. 

m. Purpose of Project: The purpose of the project is to 
provide electric energy to several of the applicant's 
municipal accounts and for sale to Niagara Mohawk Power 
Corporation. 

n. This notice also consists of the following standard 
paragraphs: A4, D9. 

o. Available Location of Application: A copy of the 
application, as amended and supplemented, is available for 
inspection and reproduction at the Commission's Public 
Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, located at 941 North 
Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104, Washington, D.C., 20426, or 
by calling (202) 208-1371. A copy is also available for 
inspection and reproduction at the Watertown Municipal 
Building, 245 Washington Street, Watertown, NY, 13601-3380 
(315) 785-7730. 

p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for 
preparation of the environmental document for the issuance 
of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to 
identify significant environmental issues related to the 
construction and operation or the continued operation of 
hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised 
during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of 
study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing 
the scope of the environmental analysis as well. If 
preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in 
the scoping process would have little potential for causing 
significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified 
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis 
will be given. 

q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local 
resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; 
Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are 
requested to forward to the Commission, any information that 
they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting 
an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and 
cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing 
activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested 
to provide information related to the following items:

 Information, data, maps or professional opinion that 
may contribute to defining the geographical and 
temporal scope of the analysis and identifying 
significant environmental issues. 
 Identification of and information from any other EIS or 
similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant 
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject 
river basin. 
 Existing information and any data that would aid in 
describing the past and present effects of the 
project(s) and other developmental activities on the 
physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic 
environments. For example, fish stocking/management 
histories in the subject river, historic water quality 
data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of 
the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to 
develop land and water resources within the basin. 
 Identification of any federal, state or local resource 
plans and future project proposals that encompass the 
subject river or basin. For example, proposals to 
construct or operate water treatment facilities, 
recreation areas, or implement fishery management 
programs. 
 Documentation that would support a conclusion that the 
project(s) 

does not 

contribute, or 

does 

contribute to 
adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources 
and therefore should be excluded from further study or 
excluded from further consideration of cumulative 
impacts within the river basin. Documentation should 
include, but not be limited to: how the project(s) 
interact with other projects within the river basin or 
other developmental activities; results from studies; 
resource management policies; and, reports from 
federal, state, and local agencies. 

Comments concerning the scope of the environmental 
document should be filed by the deadline established in 
paragraph D9.

j. Comment Date: October 31, 1994. 

k. Description of Project Action: Central Maine Power Company 
proposes to transfer the license for the Automatic Project 
No. 2555 to the Kennebec Water District. The transfer 
application is the result of the termination of a 1923 
agreement between the transferor and transferee concerning 
project ownership and operation. The purpose of the 
transfer is to facilitate conveyance of all property rights 
in the project from the transferor to the transferee. 

The transfer application was filed within five years of the 
expiration of the license for Project No. 2555, which is the 
subject of a pending relicensing application (which also 
includes project numbers 2556, 2557, and 2559). In 
Hydroelectric Relicensing Regulations Under the Federal 
Power Act (FERC stats. and Regs., Regs. Preambles 1986-1990 
 30,854 at p. 31,437), the Commission declined to forbid 
all license transfers during the last five years of an 
existing license, and instead indicated that it would 
scrutinize all such transfer requests to determine if the 
transfer's primary purpose was to give the transferee an 
advantage in relicensing (

id. 

at p. 31,438 n. 318). The 
transfer would lead to the substitution of the transferee 
for the transferor as the applicant in the relicensing 
proceedings for Project No. 2555 (the transferor would 
remain the applicant for project numbers 2556, 2557, and 
2559).

Take notice that on August 29, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 525 Milam Street, Shreveport, Louisiana
71151, filed in Docket No. CP94-743-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon and transfer by sale
to Arkla, a division of NorAm Energy Corporation, segments of Lines B and BM-9, entire Line BM-6, and included
within are 17 rural domestic taps, all located in Pope County, Arkansas, under NorAm's blanket certificate issued

0+00 to 87+25; (3) the entire Line BM-6 consisting of 216 feet of 4-inch pipe, and (4) 17 rural domestic taps (16
on BM-9 and 1 on BM-6). NGT will continue to operate the remaining portion of Line B (476,720 feet) and Line
BM-9 (10,303 feet). NGT states that these facilities will be abandoned as a result of a segment rerouting of Line
B. The rerouting, pursuant to Section 157.208(a), is necessary due to residential encroachment caused by the City
of Russellville, Arkansas annexing land for future development. Lines BM-9 and BM-6 currently provide
service to Arkla's existing distribution system and are connected to the Line B portion that will be abandoned after
the rerouting is completed. The rerouting of Line B will parallel a portion of NGT's existing Line BM-9 and interconnect
with Line BM-9 at approximately station 87+25. Line BM-6 will not interconnect with the rerouted portion
of Line B. Arkla will use the acquired facilities as part of its existing low pressure distribution system. NGT states
that no customers or services will be terminated with this abandonment.

Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208 and 157.216) for authorization to relocate
an existing meter station and appurtenant facilities in Marion County, Florida, and to abandon pipeline facilities
downstream of the existing meter station, under FGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-553-000,
pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

 

 
FGT proposes to relocate the Ocala North meter station by dismantling, moving and reassembling the facilities 3.6

downstream of the meter station. It is stated that the meter station serves West Florida Natural Gas Company (West
Florida) and that the lateral line would be abandoned by sale to West Florida, which is the only shipper served through
this lateral. It is asserted that West Florida has requested the relocation and will reimburse FGT for all direct and
indirect costs. FGT estimates the cost of the relocation at $63,000. 

It is asserted that the relocation will allow a greater hourly flow through the meter station and give West Florida
the economic ability to loop the Ocala North Lateral to utilize their existing certificated capacity. It is stated
that the relocation will permit the delivery of up to 300 MMBtu of natural gas per hour to West Florida. It is asserted
that the relocation of facilities will not result in any change in the daily or annual quantities that FGT is authorized
to deliver to West Florida. FGT states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries at the relocated
meter station without detriment or disadvantage to any of FGT's other customers.

to reflect changes regarding the identify of certain of Central Minnesota's shippers and their respective volumes
of gas shipped on the pipeline. The changes with respect to Northern Minnesota Utilities (NMU) and The City of Warroad,
Minnesota (Warroad) are to be effective immediately, and are reflected on Original Sheet No. 35. First Revised Sheet
No. 35 reflects both the NMU/Warroad change and the changes with respect to shippers Centra Gas Ontario, Inc. (Centra
Ontario) and Westcoast Power Inc. (Westcoast Power), to be effective as of December 31, 1994.
Centra Minnesota states that the referenced Sheet Nos. 32 through 34 are being filed to reserve these sheets for future
use. Tariff Sheet No. 35 is an ``Index of Shippers'' which is being filed to reflect changes in the volumes of natural
gas transported by Centra Minnesota on behalf of its shippers. These revised transportation volumes, which correspond
to changes in the Department of Energy (DOE) import and/or export authorizations of Centra Minnesota's shippers,
are as follows:
(1) Reduce the volumes of gas that Centra Minnesota is authorized to transport on behalf of Centra Ontario from up to
10,220 MMcf/year to up to 1,974 MMcf/year;
(2) Transport on behalf of Westcoast Power the remainder of the volumes that were previously transported on behalf
of Centra Ontario, 

i.e. 

8,246 MMcf/year;
(3) Eliminate Warroad as a shipper under Rate Schedule FT; and,
(4) Transport on behalf of NMU the volumes that were previously transported on behalf of Warroad.
Centra Minnesota states that the DOE has approved the changes listed above in the amounts of gas Centra Minnesota's
shippers (

i.e., 

Westcoast and Centra Ontario) are authorized to import and/or export. Centra Minnesota states that the other change
of eliminating Warroad as a shipper is due to the fact that NMU purchased the distribution facilities previously owned
by Warroad, and Centra Minnesota will now transport on behalf of NMU volumes previously transported on behalf of Warroad.
Centra Minnesota states that DOE also has approved the transfer to NMU of the import authorization granted to Warroad.
Centra Minnesota states that the corresponding changes to the volumes transported on behalf of these shippers are
fully consistent with Centra Minnesota's flexible transportation authority granted by the Commission. Additionally,
Centra Minnesota states that no increase in transportation volumes is sought and no facility construction is required.
Pursuant to  154.51 of the Commission's regulations, Centra Minnesota respectively requests waiver of the
(1) thirty day notice period so that the Warroad/NMU redistribution of volumes will become effective immediately;
and (2) requirement that tariffs not be filed more than sixty days prior to their proposed effective date so that the
change in volumes between Centra Ontario and Westcoast can be effective as of December 31, 1994. Centra Minnesota
states that such waivers will not result in any harm to any shipper since the volume of gas to be transported by Centra
Minnesota will not be increased or decreased, but is merely being reallocated.
Copies of the filing were served upon Centra Minnesota's jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should on or before September 19,
1994, file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426,
in accordance with the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211). All protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene. Copies
of Centra Minnesota's filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.; Notice of Compliance Filing</DOCTITLE>


September 12, 1994.


Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle) tendered a compliance filing
in the above referenced docket.
Panhandle states that this filing is made in compliance with the Commission's August 19, 1994, Order Accepting And

Panhandle further states that in accordance with ordering Paragraph (B) and (E) of the August 19, 1994, order, Panhandle
has provided workpapers showing the updated calculation of the current firm and interruptible surcharges based
on the firm and interruptible determinants as of the date of the filing. Since application of the updated determinants
and the removal of certain stranded costs associated with Account No. 165 and the unrecovered balance of a take-or-pay
settlement agreement with a former affiliate, as described in the August 19, 1994, Order, does not serve to decrease
the surcharges applicable to Rate Schedules FT, EFT, SCT, IT and EIT, no change to these rates is required by the Commission's
order. Accordingly, Panhandle does not propose to put the recalculated surcharges in effect at this time.
Panhandle states that copies of its filing have been served on all affected customers, all parties to this proceeding
and applicable state regulatory commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal

19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public

<DOCTITLE>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.; Notice of Proposed Change in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


September 12, 1994.


Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Compnay (Panhandle) tendered for filing the revised
tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of its filing to FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1. The proposed effective
date of the revised tariff sheets is October 1, 1994.
Panhandle states that is filing proposes the recovery of certain stranded costs by means of Reservation Surcharges
applicable to service under Rate Schedule FT, EFT and SCT and Volumetric Surcharges applicable to interruptible
rates under Rate Schedules IT and EIT.
Panhandle states that the revised tariff sheets filed herewith currently reflect the recovery of stranded costs
removed from Panhandle's filing in Docket No. RP94-325-000 as a result of the Commission's August 19,
1994, Order in that docket. In the August 19, 1994, Order, certain Order No. 636 stranded costs were excluded from the
Gas Supply Realignment (GSR) Surcharge that relate to Acount No. 165 recoupable take-or-pay and the unrecovered
balance of a take-or-pay settlement agreement with a former affiliate. These two categories of costs became stranded
upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function and thus are recoverable costs. The Commission stated that
Panhandle is not precluded from making a separate filing to recover these costs as stranded costs, although they were
not considered by the Commission to be GSR costs. Accordingly, including in the instant filing are tariff sheets to
establish such a mechanism that will commence the recovery of these stranded costs.
Panhandle states that copies of its filing have been served on all affected customers, and applicable state regulatory
commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with   385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September
19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of draft permits and permit modification. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment two draft, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits
including sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) and nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) compliance plans and one draft modification to the SO

2

 compliance plan of a previously issued final Phase I Acid Rain Permit in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations
(40 CFR parts 72 and 76). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the SO

2

 portion of the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement
addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing to the following utility
plants draft permits and a draft permit modification that propose to allocate SO

2

 emission allowances and approve SO

2

 compliance plans, consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement and that propose to approve NO

X

 compliance plans under 40 CFR part 76: 



La Cygne in Kansas: 23,489 substitution allowances for each year 1995-1999 to unit 1; 12,682 substitution allowances
for each year 1995-1999 to unit 2; two substitution plans, each for 1995-1999, in which Montrose units
1, 2, and 3 designate either unit 1 or unit 2 as a substitution unit; one NO

X

 compliance plan for 1995-1999 in which unit 2 will comply with the standard emission limitation of 0.50 lb/MMBtu.


Iatan in Missouri: 14,479 substitution allowances for each year 1995-1999 to unit 1; one substitution plan
for 1995-1999 in which Montrose units 1, 2, and 3 designate unit 1 as a substitution unit; one NO

X

 compliance plan for 1995-1999 in which unit 1 will comply with the standard emission limitation of 0.50 lbs/MMBtu.


Montrose in Missouri: three substitution plans, each for 1995-1999, in which units 1, 2, and 3 designate either
La Cygne unit 1, La Cygne unit 2, or Iatan unit 1 as a substitution unit.

<DOCTITLE>Workshop on the Use of Available Data and Methods for Assessing the Ecological Risks of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin
to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the availability of a report entitled 

``Workshop on the Use of Available Data and Methods for Assessing the Ecological Risks of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin
to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife''.

 This report compiles discussions and recommendations from a 1993 workshop sponsored by EPA's Risk Assessment Forum.
While the report addresses scientific issues related to ecological risk assessment, considerations of EPA policy
on TCDD, revisions to EPA's ecological risk framework, formulating a complete TCDD risk assessment, and issues related
to the health effects of TCDD were beyond the scope of the workshop and are not addressed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In March, 1993, EPA released the 

Interim Report on Data and Methods for the Assessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetra
chloro
dibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) Risks to Aquatic Life and Associated Wildlife

 (Interim Report; EPA 600/R-93/055). This report compiled and critically reviewed current scientific literature
concerning toxicity and exposure data for TCDD-related effects on aquatic and wildlife species. On September 15
and 16, 1993, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum sponsored a workshop to discuss use of data and methods in the Interim Report
for ecological risk assessments. Workshop participants used both the Interim Report and the EPA report 

Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment

 (EPA/630/R-92/001) as starting materials. Workshop participants identified significant issues, discussed
major uncertainties and recommended research needs for future assessments. In addition, workshop participants
developed a ``conceptual model'' for a hypothetical scenario concerning TCDD effects on aquatic life and wildlife.
This model, which includes comments and suggestions on the transport, fate, and effects of TCDD and related compounds,
should be helpful to risk assessors planning to evaluate the ecological risks of TCDD. While the report addresses
scientific issues related to ecological risk assessment, considerations of EPA policy on TCDD, revisions to EPA's
ecological risk framework, formulating a complete TCDD risk assessment, and issues related to the health effects
of TCDD were beyond the scope of the workshop and were not addressed.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a meeting of the clinical hold review committee, which reviews
the clinical holds that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has placed on certain investigational
new drug trials. The committee was established as a 1-year experiment in August 1991. The committee met quarterly
through 1992 and currently meets semiannually as a regular program. The committee last met in April 1994. FDA is inviting
any interested drug company to use the confidential mechanism to submit to the committee for its review the name and
number of any investigational new drug trial placed on clinical hold during the past 12 months that the company wants
the committee to review.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA regulations at part 312 (21 CFR part 312) provide procedures that govern the use of investigational new drugs in
human subjects. These regulations require that the sponsor of a clinical investigation submit an investigational
new drug application (IND) to FDA outlining the proposed use of the investigational drug. The IND must contain the
study protocol, a summary of human and animal experience with the drug, and information about the drug's chemistry
and pharmacology. FDA reviews an IND to help ensure the safety and rights of subjects and to help ensure that the quality
of any scientific evaluation of drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's efficacy and safety. An investigational
new drug for which an IND is in effect is exempt from the premarketing approval requirements that are otherwise applicable
and may be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting clinical investigations of that drug.


If FDA determines that a proposed or ongoing study may pose significant risks for human subjects or is otherwise seriously
deficient, as discussed in the investigational new drug regulations, it may impose a clinical hold on the study. The
clinical hold is one of FDA's primary mechanisms for protecting subjects who are involved in investigational new
drug trials. A clinical hold is an order that FDA issues to a sponsor to delay a proposed investigation or to suspend
an ongoing investigation. The clinical hold may be placed on one or more of the investigations covered by an IND. When
a proposed study is placed on clinical hold, subjects may not be given the investigational drug as part of that study.
When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold, no new subjects may be recruited to the study and placed on the investigational
drug, and patients already in the study should stop receiving therapy involving the investigational drug unless
FDA specifically permits it. 
FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.42 describe the grounds for the imposition of a clinical hold. When FDA concludes that
there is a deficiency in a proposed or ongoing clinical trial that may be grounds for the imposition of a hold order,
ordinarily FDA will attempt to resolve the matter through informal discussions with the sponsor. If that attempt
is unsuccessful, the agency may order a clinical hold. In CDER, a clinical hold is ordered by or on behalf of the director
of the division that is responsible for review of the IND. The order identifies the studies under the IND to which the
hold applies and explains the basis for the action. The hold order may be made by telephone or other means of rapid communication,
or in writing. Within 30 days of the imposition of the clinical hold, the division director provides the sponsor with
a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Any sponsor who has not received a written explanation within 30 days
should notify the division and request that it be issued. In addition to providing a statement of reasons, this ensures
that the hold is recorded in CDER's management information system. 
The clinical hold order specifies whether the sponsor may resume the affected investigation without prior notification
by FDA once the deficiency has been corrected. If the order does not permit the resumption, an investigation may resume
only after the division director or his or her designee has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed.
Resumption may be authorized by telephone or other means of rapid communication. If all investigations covered by
an IND remain on clinical hold for 1 year or longer, FDA may place the IND on inactive status. 
FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.48 provide dispute resolution mechanisms through which sponsors may request reconsideration
of clinical hold orders. The regulations encourage the sponsor to attempt to resolve disputes directly with the review
staff responsible for the review of the IND. If necessary, a sponsor may request a meeting with the review staff and
management to discuss the hold.
Over the years, drug sponsors have expressed a number of concerns about the clinical hold process, including concerns
about the scientific and procedural adequacy of some agency actions. FDA undertook several initiatives to evaluate
the consistency and fairness of the Center's practices in imposing clinical holds. First, CDER completed a center-wide
review of clinical holds recorded in the management information system. While some differences in practice and procedure
were discerned among divisions, it appeared that the procedures specified in the regulations were, in general, being
followed, and that holds were scientifically supportable.
Second, FDA established a committee in CDER to review selected clinical holds for scientific and procedural quality.
The committee held pilot meetings in 1991 and 1992. The trial phase of the committee review process confirmed the agency's
view that the divisions in CDER impose clinical holds in a matter that is generally consistent with FDA's procedural
requirements and that holds are imposed on scientifically supportable grounds. 
The clinical hold committee review process is now a regular, ongoing program. The review procedure of the committee
is designed to afford an opportunity for a sponsor who does not wish to seek formal reconsideration of a pending hold
to have that hold considered ``anonymously.'' The committee consists of senior managers in CDER, a senior official
from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and FDA's Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. The committee now
meets semiannually. The committee last met in April 1994. 
Clinical holds to be reviewed will be chosen randomly. In addition, the committee will review holds proposed for review
by drug sponsors. In general, a drug sponsor should consider requesting review when it disagrees with the agency's
scientific or procedural basis for the decision. 
Requests for committee review of a clinical hold should be submitted to FDA's Chief Mediator and Ombudsman, who is
responsible for selecting clinical holds for review. The committee and CDER staff, with the exception of the Chief
Mediator and Ombudsman, are never advised, either in the review process or thereafter, which of the holds were randomly
chosen and which were submitted by sponsors. The committee will evaluate the selected clinical holds for scientific
content and consistency with agency regulations and CDER policy.
The meetings of the review committee are closed to the public because committee discussions deal with confidential
commercial information. Summaries of the committee deliberations, excluding confidential commercial information,
will be available from the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. If the status of a clinical hold changes following the committee's
review, the appropriate division will notify the sponsor.
FDA invites drug companies to submit to the FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman the name and IND number of any investigational
new drug trial that was placed on clinical hold during the past 12 months that they want the committee to review at its
October meeting. Submissions should be made by October 17, 1994, to Amanda B. Pedersen, FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman
(address above.)

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of limited field of use co-exclusive worldwide
licenses to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications Number 07/073,685 filed on July 15, 1987
and Number 07/547,336 filed on July 20, 1990, entitled ``Second Generation Monoclonal Antibodies Having Binding
Specificity to TAG-72 and Human Carcinomas and Methods for Employing the Same'', to Centocor, Inc., having
a place of business in Malvern, PA, and to Miles, Inc., having a place of business in Tarrytown, NY. The patent rights
in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The antibodies covered in this patent application have a higher binding affinity and specificity to a tumor associated
glycoprotein (designated TAG-72) than previous monoclonal antibodies available against TAG-72. The
current antibodies also exhibit binding specificity to more human carcinomas than the previous monoclonals, while
maintaining essentially no specificity to normal adult human tissues. 
The prospective co-exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35
U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective co-exclusive licenses may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date
of this published Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses
would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The field of use would be limited to 

in vitro 

non-radioimmunodiagnostic assays utilizing TAG-72 antibody.

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 3,4-Dihydrocoumarin
</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin, which is used as a flavoring agent in beverages, gelatins, puddings,
candy, and other food items and as a fragrance in perfumes, creams, and cosmetics. 

Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering 3,4-dihydrocoumarin (99% pure) in corn oil
by gavage to groups of 60 male and female F344/N rats at doses of 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight for 2 years. Groups
of 70 male and female B6C3F mice received 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg
body weight for 2 years. 

Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
 of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male F344/N rats based on increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas and focal hyperplasia.
The transitional cell carcinomas in two 600 mg/kg males may also have been chemical related. There was no evidence
of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in female F344/N rats receiving 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. There was
no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg.
There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular
adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). 





3,4-Dihydrocoumarin caused ulcers, hyperplasia, and inflammation of the forestomach, parathyroid gland hyperplasia,
and increased severity of nephropathy in male rats. 

Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541-3419.

Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada



T. 19 S., R. 60 E.,



Sec. 33: NE1/4NE1/4NE1/4NW1/4




Containing 2.5 acres, more or less.




The land is not required for any federal purpose. The lease/conveyance is consistent with current Bureau planning
for this area and would be in the public interest. The lease/patent, when issued, will be subject to the provisions
of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act and applicable regulations of the Secretary of the Interior, and will contain
the following reservations to the United States:


1. A right-of-way thereon for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States, Act of August 30,
1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).

2. Those rights for test well purposes which have been granted to the U.S. Geological Survey by Permit No. NEV-055727
under the Act of January 13, 1916 (44 LD 513).

Detailed information concerning this action is available for review at the office of the Bureau of Land Management,
Las Vegas District, 4765 W. Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada.

Upon publication of this notice in the

the above described land will be segregated from all other forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including
the general mining laws, except for lease/conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, leasing under
the mineral leasing laws and disposals under the mineral material disposal laws. For a period of 45 days from the date
of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register, 

interested parties may submit comments regarding the proposed lease/conveyance for classification of the lands
to the District Manager, Las Vegas District, P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126.




CLASSIFICATION COMMENTS: 

Interested parties may submit comments involving the suitability of the land for a public park. Comments on the classification
are restricted to whether the land is physically suited for the proposal, whether the use will maximize the future
use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with local planning and zoning, or if the use is consistent with
State and Federal programs.




APPLICATION COMMENTS: 

Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the application and plan of development,
whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the decision, or any other factor not directly
related to the suitability of the land for a public park.



Any adverse comments will be reviewed by the State Director.

In the absence of any adverse comments, the classification of the land described in this Notice will become effective
60 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. The lands will not be offered for lease/conveyance until after the classification becomes effective.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Technical/Agency Draft Recovery Plan for Callicarpa ampla, Ilex sintenisii, Styrax portoricensis,
Ternstroemia luquillensis and Ternstroemia subsessilis for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery
plan for Callicarpa ampla, Ilex sintenisii, Styrax portoricensis, Ternstroemia luquillensis and Ternstroemia
subsessilis. These species are restricted to the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. Deforestation and fragmentation
of habitat may have restricted these species to their present locations. The Service solicits review and comments
from the public on this draft plan.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish them,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
This Technical/Agency Draft is for five Puerto Rican endangered trees, Callicarpa ampla, Ilex sintenisii, Styrax
portoricensis, Ternstroemia luquillensis and Ternstroemia subsessilis, all endemic to the island of Puerto Rico.
These trees are currently restricted to the Luquillo Mountains. These endangered trees face extinction due to deforestation
for construction of communication facilities, roads, as well as overcollection, periodic impact of hurricanes,
and forest management practices of Caribbean National Forest. Callicarpa ampla is an evergreen tree up to 50 feet
tall with small white flowers and purplish ripe fruits. Today, approximately fourteen individuals are known to exist.
Ilex sintenisii is a shrub or small tree 15-20 feet in height. It grows in the highest peaks of the Caribbean National
Forest, within the dwarf forest vegetation type. Styrax portoricensis is a tree, 30-40 feet tall, known from
a single individual. Ternstroemia luquillensis is a 60 foot tree endemic to the Luquillo Mountains, where it is known
from less than 40 individuals. Ternstroemia subsessilis is a shrub or small tree 15-20 feet tall. It is known
from less than 40 individuals.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.


Authority


The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

<DOCTITLE>Burlington Northern Railroad Company, Inc. and Protexa Burlington International_Joint Application Under 49 U.S.C.
11321 </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Application and Institution of Proceeding. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Burlington Northern Railroad Company, Inc. (BN) and Protexa Burlington International (PBI) filed a joint application
under the Panama Canal Act (the Act), 49 U.S.C. 11321, for (1) a determination that BN's ownership interest in and operation
of PBI do not violate the provisions of the Act, and (2) approval, under 49 U.S.C. 11321(b), of BN's continued ownership
interest in PBI to eliminate any question as to whether the anticipated expansion of PBI's operations may bring it
within the scope of the Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 BN is a class I railroad operating in the northwestern and central United States. PBI, a joint venture formed to offer
rail-on-barge water transportation between the United States and Mexico, is owned equally by BN and Grupo Protexa
S.A. de C.V., a Mexican marine and industrial firm based in Monterrey, Mexico. At present, BN provides rail service
between United States points and Galveston, TX, under transportation contracts with PBI, while a PBI affiliate,
PBI-Bahamas, a vessel operating common carrier, provides water transportation between Galveston and Coatzacoalcos,
Mexico. BN's cars are then moved from Coatzacoalcos to other Mexican destinations by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de
Mexico. Applicants state that their integrated operation improves BN's access to central and southern Mexican markets
and that PBI's service may be expanded to Veracruz, Altamira, and other Mexican ports. 



The Panama Canal Act prohibits a railroad from acquiring an interest in a water common carrier in areas where both may
compete for traffic, unless the Commission finds that, notwithstanding such competition, cross-ownership will
allow the water carrier ``to be operated in the public interest * * * and that it will still allow competition, without
reduction, on the water route in question.'' 49 U.S.C. 11321(b). Applicants request the Commission to find that BN
is not in violation of the Act, because it does not and cannot compete via all-rail service for the traffic handled by
PBI. In light of PBI's anticipated expansion to other Mexican ports, applicants also seek approval of BN's ownership
interest in PBI on the grounds that PBI's service will enhance, rather than reduce, competition on the water route
and will continue to be operated in the public interest. 

Comments should address the competitive and public interest aspects of the joint application. In addition, comments
may be directed to the impact, if any, on this proceeding of BN's recently announced proposal to merge with The Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company. Copies of the joint application are on file and may be examined at the Office of
the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC. Copies may also be requested from applicants' representative
Betty Jo Christian, (202) 429-3000.

<DOCTITLE>Houston Belt & Terminal Railway Company, et al.; Joint Relocation Project Exemption </DOCTITLE>



On August 18, 1994, the Houston Belt & Terminal Railway Company (HB&T), the Southern Pacific Transportation
Company (SP), The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (ATSF), and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company
(MP) (collectively, the Railroads) jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate two
lines of railroad.

1

 The proposed transaction was expected to be consummated on or after August 25, 1994. 





The joint project involves: (1) partial abandonment of certain segments of the Railroads' lines; (2) the construction
by HB&T of connecting tracks; and (3) a grant of trackage rights to SP and HB&T. 

Under the joint project, ATSF will abandon approximately a 0.75-mile portion of the HB&T West Main line between
Commerce Street (ATSF MP 24.10) and Runnels Street (ATSF MP 24.37), and between Nance Street (ATSF MP 24.89) and Brooks
Street (ATSF 25.37) (including the crossing of the SP Main line).

2 







HB&T will abandon approximately a 0.5-mile portion of the HB&T West Main line between Runnels Street (ATSF
MP 24.37) and Nance Street (ATSF MP 24.89).

3 







MP will abandon approximately a 0.6-mile portion of the HB&T East Main line from a point north of the Carr Street
Connection (with the SP Main line) (IGN Engineer's Station 7881 + 41) to Campbell Street (IGN Engineer's Station 7848
+ 60) (including the crossing of the SP Main line). HB&T and MP will discontinue service over approximately a 0.65-mile
portion of the HB&T East Main line between Campbell Street and Collingsworth Street and use that track as an industrial
track for serving future industries and for storing railroad cars. 

HB&T will double track the HB&T East Main line on existing right-of-way between Commerce Street and Lyons
Avenue in order to relocate the HB&T West Main line.

4

 HB&T will construct double connecting track (the Connecting Track) between the HB&T East Main line at Lyons
Avenue and the HB&T West Main line at Brooks Street on the right-of-way acquired by HB&T. The Connecting Track
will cross the SP Main line under the authority of the Trackage Rights Agreement. To relocate the HB&T East Main
line, HB&T will double track the HB&T West Main line on existing right-of-way between Brooks Street and Quitman
Street. 





HB&T will construct additional HB&T East Main trackage adjacent to and to the north of the SP Shreveport Branch
northeast from Quitman Street, connecting with existing HB&T East Main trackage at Collingsworth Street. Approximately
952 feet of this additional track will be on existing HB&T right-of-way and the remaining additional track will
be constructed on a strip of right-of-way approximately 2,600 feet long and between 35 and 40 feet wide adjacent to
the existing SP Shreveport Branch right-of-way, which HB&T is in the process of acquiring. HB&T will construct
a connection (the Brooks Street Connection) between the SP Main line and the relocated HB&T East Main line at the
Connecting Track in the vicinity of Brooks Street over a right-of-way it has acquired. After completion, SP will own
and maintain the track of the Brooks Street Connection.

Upon approval of the joint relocation project and pursuant to an agreement between SP and HB&T, the parties will
grant the following trackage rights: (1) SP will grant HB&T rights over the SP Shreveport Branch northeast from
Quitman Street, a distance of approximately 9,440 feet; (2) HB&T will grant SP rights over the relocated HB&T
East Main between the Brooks Street Connection and Quitman Street, a distance of approximately 3,500 feet; and (3)
HB&T will grant SP rights over the additional HB&T East Main trackage between Quitman Street and Collingsworth
Street, a distance of approximately 3,550 feet. 

The line relocation project will improve operating efficiency by alleviating traffic congestion in the HB&T/SP
interlocker at Tower 26. The construction of the Connecting Track will enable HB&T to consolidate two separate
crossings of the SP Main line at a single location. The relocation of the HB&T East Main line and the grant of trackage
rights will enable HB&T and SP to retire the rail crossing of the HB&T West Main line and the SP Shreveport Branch
at Quitman Street, and the rail crossing of the HB&T East Main line and the SP Shreveport Branch at Collingsworth
Street. The relocation of the HB&T East Main line adjacent to the HB&T West Main line and the SP Shreveport
Branch will enable MP to remove track from the HB&T East Main line between a point north of the Carr Street Connection
and Campbell Street, thereby improving public safety by eliminating eight at-grade road crossings. 

The Railroads state that no shippers are located on any of the line segments to be abandoned. The Railroads assert that
this joint project will not change service to shippers, expand the operations of any of the Railroads into new territory,
or alter the existing competitive situation. 

The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment or construction components of a relocation project,
and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to
shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. 

See generally Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation Over BN

, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions
such as the one involved here. 

See D.T.&I.R._Trackage Rights

, 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental abandonment, construction, and trackage
rights components require no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt
service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). 

As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN

, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate

, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: John C. Pruetz, Houston Belt
& Terminal Railway Company, 501 Crawford, Room 203, Houston, TX 77002-2192; Gary A. Laakso, Southern Pacific
Transportation Company, One Market Plaza, San Francisco, CA 94105; Michael A. Smith, The Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Company, 1700 East Golf Road, Schaumburg, IL 60173-5860; and Joseph D. Anthofer, Missouri Pacific
Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179-0830.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to CERCLA</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Department policy, 28 CFR 50.7, and pursuant to Section 122(d) and (i) of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C.  9622 (d) and (i), notice is hereby given
that a proposed consent decree in United States v. Alcatel Network Systems, et al., Civil Action No. CIV 94-1821
PHX-RCB was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on September 2, 1994. This
agreement resolves a judicial enforcement action brought by the United States against the defendants pursuant to
Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C.   9606 and 9607.

The proposed consent decree provides that the defendants will design and construct a groundwater extraction and
treatment system with reinjection of treated groundwater at the Hassayampa Landfill Superfund Site in Maricopa

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis Bacon Act of march 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay on the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S-3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately)



I 



Jerome E. Bodian (Licensee or Dr. Bodian) was the holder of NRC License No. 29-12417-01 (License) issued
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35 on September 11, 1967 and
last renewed in its entirety on August 20, 1990. The License authorized the Licensee to possess and use iodine-131
as iodide for uptake studies, thyroid imaging, and the treatment of hypothyroidism and cardiac disfunction. The
License was due to expire on August 30, 1995; however on January 25, 1993, the Licensee requested that the License be
terminated. The NRC granted this request for termination, and Amendment No. 07 was issued to the Licensee on September
27, 1993, terminating the License.



II



On April 6, 1992, an NRC inspection was conducted at the Licensee's facility in Englewood, New Jersey. During the inspection,
the NRC identified several violations of NRC requirements, including the failure to possess and use a dose calibrator
to assay therapeutic doses of iodine-131 prior to administration to patients. Also during the inspection, Dr. Bodian
told the inspector that he took doses of iodine-131 to Englewood Hospital for calibration. During a telephone conversation
with Region I staff on April 7, 1992, Dr. Bodian stated that: (1) although he did not possess a dose calibrator, he had
a technologist at Englewood Hospital perform the dose measurements for almost all patients he had treated; (2) all
measurements of doses were within 

#

 10 percent of the prescribed dose; and (3) the results of these measurements were recorded in the patient charts.

Shortly after the inspection, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Action Letter to the Licensee on April 9, 1992, which confirmed,
in part, the Licensee's agreement to terminate patient treatments with any radiopharmaceutical authorized by the
NRC until such time as the Licensee established, and submitted to the NRC for approval, a program that included all
of the required equipment and procedures required by 10 CFR Part 35. Such a program was not established and patient
treatment has not resumed. The NRC Office of Investigations initiated an investigation on May 22, 1992. Dr. Bodian
requested, in a letter dated January 25, 1993, that the License be terminated.

In view of Dr. Bodian's willful failure to adhere to NRC requirements, as well as the apparently willful failure to
provide complete and accurate information to the NRC, thereby endangering patients to whom the doses were administered,
the NRC needed certain information to determine whether there existed reasonable assurance that Dr. Bodian's activities
conducted under other NRC licenses would be performed safely and in accordance with requirements. Accordingly,
a Demand for Information (DFI) was issued to Dr. Bodian on June 24, 1993, that requested him to list all NRC licenses
on which he was then listed as an authorized user, and to explain why the NRC should not issue an order to preclude him
from any involvement in licensed activities in the future.

On July 20, 1993, Dr. Bodian responded to the Demand for Information stating that (1) on infrequent occasions a precalibrated
dose of radioiodine was administered without prior use of dose calibrator; (2) a request for termination of his license
(No. 29-12417-01) was made on January 25, 1993; and (3) his listing (as an authorized user) on the Englewood
Hospital license (No. 29-08519-01) was a carry over from years ago, and that any administration of radiopharmaceuticals
to his patients at Englewood hospital was done under the supervision of the hospital radiology department.

The NRC OI report issued July 26, 1993 determined that notwithstanding Dr. Bodian's statements to the NRC, the doses,
with a few exceptions, were not assayed with a dose calibrator prior to administration, even though Dr. Bodian was
aware that such assays were required. This finding is based on the fact that although the Licensee's records indicate
that 30 iodine-131 doses were provided to patients between January 1990 and April 1992, the NRC has found that
most doses were not assayed for the Licensee in the Hospital's dose calibrator during that time. This willful failure
to adhere to this requirement, as well as the willful false statements to the NRC during the inspection on April 6, 1992
and the April 7, 1992 telephone conversation, constitute violations of 10 CFR 35.53, 10 CFR 30.9, and 10 CFR 30.10.



III



Based on the above, it appears that Dr. Bodian, the Licensee, engaged in deliberate misconduct that constitutes a
violation of 10 CFR 30.10(a)(1) and that has caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.53. It further appears
that Dr. Bodian deliberately provided to NRC inspectors information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in
some respect material to the NRC, in violation of 10 CFR 30.09 and CFR 30.10(a)(2). Dr. Bodian has demonstrated an unwillingness
to comply with Commission requirements. NRC must be able to rely on its licensees to comply with NRC requirements,
including the requirement to provide complete and accurate information. Willful violations are of particular concern
to the Commission because they undermine the Commission's reasonable assurance that licensed activities will be
conducted in accordance with NRC requirements. Dr. Bodian's actions have raised serious doubt as to whether he can
be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC. Consequently,
protection of the public health, safety and interest require that Dr. Bodian be prohibited from engaging in NRC-licensed
activities for a period of 5 years and to notify the NRC prior to resumption of any NRC-licensed activities at any facility
after termination of the five year prohibition.

In telephone conversations on July 18, 19, and 20, 1994, with Dr. Ronald R. Bellamy of the NRC Region I office, Dr. Bodian
agreed not to be involved in any NRC-licensed activities for a period of five years, and to notify the NRC prior to resumption
of any licensed activities at any facility after that five year prohibition. I find that the Dr. Bodian's commitments
as set forth in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the protection
of the public health and safety is reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health
and safety require that the Dr. Bodian's commitments in the telephone conversations of July 18, 19, and 20, 1994 be
confirmed by this Order. Dr. Bodian has agreed to this action. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that
the significance of the violations described above is such that the public health and safety require that this Order
be immediately effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to section 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35, It is hereby ordered that:




1. For a period of five years from the date of this Confirmatory Order, Jerome E. Bodian, M.D., shall not engage in any
NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific
or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licenses
conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.

2. When, for the first time, Dr. Bodian is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the five year prohibition,
he shall notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406,
within 20 days prior to engaging in NRC-licensed activities, including activities under an Agreement State license
when activities under that license are conducted in areas of NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The notice
shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where
licensed activities will be performed.

The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing by
Dr. Bodian of good cause.



V




Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately), other than Dr. Bodian, may request
a hearing within 20 days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be
sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington D.C. 20555, to the Assistant
General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475
Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to Dr. Bodian. If such a person requests a hearing, that person
shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall
address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).




If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating
the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this
Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately) should be sustained.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person adversely affected by this Order, other than Dr. Bodian, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of September 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-71 and DPR-62 issued to Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for operation
of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Brunswick County, North Carolina.
The proposed amendment would revise the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber
vacuum breakers when a valve position indictor is inoperable from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every
14 days. The proposed change is consistent with the testing frequency for this equipment that is stipulated in the
Improved Boiling Water Reactor Standard Technical Specifications.
By letter dated September 9, 1994, the licensee requested exigent handling of the proposed amendment request. The
licensee stated that, on September 3, 1994, the closed position indication was found inoperable on one vacuum breaker,
and they have been performing the required testing to verify that the vacuum breaker is closed. Since the plant is in
operation and the primary containment suppression chamber is inerted with nitrogen, the suppression chamber is
not accessible to repair the vacuum breaker position indication without an unscheduled plant shutdown. To conduct
the vacuum breaker test, the nitrogen pressure is increased inside the drywell to establish the test pressure. This
test reduces the operational margin between the actual drywell pressure and the high drywell pressure trip setpoint.
If this setpoint is reached or exceeded, a reactor scram and Group 1 isolation will occur. Therefore, the changes to
the test frequency will reduce the potential for incurring an unnecessary plant transient.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
The proposed change revises the surveillance requirements associated with inoperable position indication for
drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers. No safety-related equipment, safety function or plant operations
will be altered as a result of the proposed change. The change does not affect the design, materials, or construction
standards applicable to the vacuum breakers or their position indication instrumentation.
Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers from
at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days, as stated in the existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1,
ACTION c, will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers to perform their intended
safety function. The extended frequency provides adequate assurance that the vacuum breakers will perform their
intended safety function. Each drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breaker will continue to be demonstrated OPERABLE
and closed at least once per 31 days and after any discharge of steam to the suppression chamber in accordance with Technical
Specification 4.6.1.a. In addition, the new surveillance requirement provided in the proposed Technical Specification
4.6.4.1.a will require that each vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance
provides further assurance that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident
conditions of allowing the venting of non-condensible gases from the suppression chamber to the drywell while not
allowing bypass flow from the drywell to the suppression chamber.
Based on the above, the proposed change does not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
2. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
As stated above, no safety-related equipment, safety function or plant operations will be altered as a result of the
proposed change. The change does not affect the design, materials, or construction standards applicable to the vacuum
breakers or their position indication instrumentation.
Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers of the
existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1, ACTION c from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days
will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers to perform their intended safety
function.
In addition, the new surveillance requirement provided in proposed Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a will require
that each vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance will provide further
assurance that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident conditions without
altering plant operations in a manner that would create a new or different kind of accident.

As such, the proposed license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change does not involve any changes to the plant design or operation. Therefore, no margins of safety,
as defined by the plant's accident analyses, are impacted. Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position
of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers of the existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1, ACTION c from
at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber
vacuum breakers to perform their intended safety function. The extended frequency provides adequate assurance
that the vacuum breakers will perform their intended safety function. Each drywell-suppression chamber vacuum
breaker will continue to be demonstrated OPERABLE and closed at least once per 31 days and after any discharge of steam
to the suppression chamber in accordance with Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a.

In addition, performance of Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.b requires pressurization of the drywell to approximately
1.0 psig and then verifying that the differential drywell to suppression chamber pressure is maintained greater
than one-half the initial differential pressure for one hour without nitrogen makeup. During this evolution actual
pressure will increase as high as 1.1 psig before stablizing. The Drywell Pressure_High setpoint, which initiates
a reactor scram and a Group 1 isolation, is less than or equal to 2.0 psig (the actual setpoint is 1.8 psig). As such, performance
of this evolution once per 72 hours unnecessarily risks a plant transient without providing a significant increase
in the level of safety gained by performing the verification on a 14 day frequency.

The new surveillance requirement provided in proposed Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a will require that each
vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance provides further assurance
that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident conditions of allowing the
venting of non-condensible gases from the suppression chamber to the drywell while not allowing bypass flow from
the drywell to the suppression chamber.


Based on the above reasoning, the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin
of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.


Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. 


Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
By October 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison
Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an
appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)
and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 9, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at University of North Carolina at Wilmington,
William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297.

<DOCTITLE>Creative Biomolecules, Inc.; Hopkinton, MA; Order Modifying License (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>


I


Creative Biomolecules, Inc. (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct License No. 20-20592-01 (License)
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30. The License authorizes
the Licensee to use certain stated byproduct materials for research and development as defined in  30.4(q)
of 10 CFR Part 30. The License, originally issued on April 20, 1983, was amended in its entirety of March 3, 1993, and
was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect since that time due to a timely renewal request made pursuant
to 10 CFR 30.37(b).


II


On November 10-11, 1992, the NRC performed an inspection at the Licensee's facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.
During the inspection, the NRC identified numerous violations of NRC requirements. As a result of the inspection
findings, a Confirmatory Action Letter was issued to the Licensee on November 12, 1992. The inspector also found indications
that information provided by Dr. William F. Kusmik (the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) at the facility at the time
of an NRC inspection in November 1992) in a letter dated September 21, 1992, did not appear to be accurate, and that records
of monthly wipe tests at the facility may have been falsified. As a result, an investigation was conducted by the NRC
Office of Investigations (OI).
As a result of the OI investigation, a transcribed enforcement conference was conducted on June 7, 1994, with Dr. Kusmik,
to address whether he: (1) Deliberately directed a Licensee employee to falsify certain NRC-required wipe test records;
and (2) deliberately provided false or misleading information to the NRC in a letter dated September 21, 1992, in response
to a previous Notice of Violation (Notice) issued by the NRC on July 29, 1992.
With respect to the issue of records falsification, Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that in
1991 he directed an employee to fabricate records of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990
and February 1991), even though the tests had not been performed for those months.
With respect to the information provided in the September 21, 1992 letter signed by Dr. Kusmik and sent to the NRC, Dr.
Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that he had stated in the letter that certain actions had been taken
in response to NRC inspection findings articulated in the July 29, 1992 letter and Notice, when, in fact, those stated
actions had not been taken. Specifically, in response to the July 29, 1992 Notice involving the failure to perform
surveys of a certain laboratory required to be performed by License Condition 14, the September 21, 1992 letter stated
that ``To avoid a repetition of these discrepancies, three individuals within the laboratory have been trained to
perform these surveys.'' This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik stated during the enforcement conference
that while he intended to provide such training, no such training subsequent to the July 29, 1992 Notice had been provided
at the time Dr. Kusmik signed and sent the September 21, 1992 letter to the NRC. In addition, in response to a concern
expressed in the NRC's July 29, 1992 letter transmitting the Notice, involving the licensee's plans to obtain access
to a thyroid phantom or some other method to quantitatively determine thyroid uptakes of personnel, the licensee's
September 21, 1992 letter stated that ``A calibrated survey meter with a Sodium Iodine [Iodide] crystal has been recalibrated
for thyroid counting using a thyroid phantom consisting of a plexiglas block approximately three inches thick.''
This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that the sodium iodide
crystal had not been recalibrated at the time he had signed and sent the letter to the NRC.
Based on the above, the NRC has concluded that in 1991, Dr. Kusmik caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a).
Specifically, Dr. Kusmik deliberately directed an employee to fabricate records, required to be maintained by License
Condition 14, of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990 and February 1991), even though the
tests had not been performed during those months. In addition, on September 21, 1992, Dr. Kusmik violated 10 CFR 30.10(a)
by engaging in deliberate misconduct that caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a). Specifically,
Dr. Kusmik deliberately submitted to the NRC false information in the September 21, 1992 letter in which he sated that:
(1) Three individuals within the laboratory had been trained to perform surveys; and (2) a calibrated survey meter
with a Sodium Iodide crystal had been recalibrated for thyroid counting.

III




As a result, the NRC has serious concerns regarding Dr. Kusmik's performance and supervision of NRC-licensed activities,
and in particular, the supervision of such activities. Dr. Kusmik's actions were particularly serious since, as
the RSO at the facility, Dr. Kusmik was charged with ensuring that Licensee staff adhered to requirements and performed
activities in a safe manner. Rather than properly discharging those responsibilities, Dr. Kusmik set an unacceptable
example for the individuals to whom he gave direction, as well as to others engaged in NRC-licensed activities at the
facility.
The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement
to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate in all material respects. Dr. Kusmik's
actions in causing the Licensee to violate 10 CFR 30.9 and his misrepresentations to the NRC have raised serious doubt
as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information
to the NRC, if he was employed as an RSO or authorized user.
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public, including the licensee's employees,
will be protected if Dr. Kusmik were permitted at this time to be an authorized user listed on the License or act as an
RSO. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that License No. 20-20592-01 be modified
to: (1) Remove Dr. Kusmik from being named on the License as an authorized user and prohibit Dr. Kusmik from acting as
an RSO; and (2) require that Dr. Kusmik be directly supervised by an authorized user should he perform NRC-licensed
activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the conduct described above is
such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.


IV


Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 30, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that
license no. 20-20592-01 is modified as follows:
A. Dr. William F. Kusmik, for a period one year from the date of this Order, is:
1. removed from Condition 11.A of License No. 20-20592-01 as an authorized user; and
2. prohibited from acting as an RSO.
B. During the one-year period set forth in Paragraph IV.A of this Order, the Licensee may allow Dr. Kusmik to perform
NRC-licensed activities only if he is under the direct supervision of an authorized user as defined below. NRC-licensed
activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to License No. 20-20592-01. Supervision
of Dr. Kusmik during this period shall be performed as follows:
1. The Licensee must document the name of the authorized user responsible for supervising Dr. Kusmik's activities
and ensuring compliance with all applicable NRC requirements.
2. The supervising authorized user shall routinely observe and review all radiological safety records generated
by Dr. Kusmik's activities. On a monthly basis, records generated by Dr. Kusmik will be reviewed and initialed by the
supervising authorized user to assure that the records are complete and accurate. Any record found not to be in accordance
with NRC requirements shall be reported to the RSO.
3. The RSO shall:
a. ensure and document that he/she has provided training to Dr. Kusmik on the License, its conditions, and all applicable
NRC requirements, including the Licensee's radiation safety procedures;
b. perform documented audits of all radiological safety activities conducted by Dr. Kusmik on quarterly basis; and

c. review and institute corrective actions for any violations noted.
4. The documents required in Paragraph IV.B of this Order must be retained until the next NRC inspection following
the one-year restriction of Dr. Kusmik.
C. For purposes of this Order, an authorized user is a person who is listed on the License as a user of, or is an individual
who supervises other persons using, NRC-licensed material.
The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by the Licensee of good cause.


V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and Dr. Kusmik and any other person adversely affected by this Order
may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order.
The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under
oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the
matters of fact and law on which the Licensee, Dr. Kusmik or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons
as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also
shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator,
NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to the Licensee and Dr. Kusmik if the answer
or hearing request is by a person other than the Licensee or Dr. Kusmik. If a person other than the Licensee or Dr. Kusmik
requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected
by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by the Licensee, Dr. Kusmik, or any other person whose interest is adversely affected, the
Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered
at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), the Licensee, Dr. Kusmik, or any other person adversely affected by this Order,
may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the same time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to
set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness,
is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.



Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of September 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-47, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the River Bend Station
(RBS), located in West Feliciana Parish. 
The proposed amendment would provide the licensee the ability to search and determine the location, while at power,
of leaking fuel bundles within the reactor core, by modifying Technical Specification (TS) 3.10.2. This modification
adds the rod withdrawal limiter notch constraints as one of the items that can be bypassed to allow continuous rod withdrawal,
in addition to adding fuel power suppression testing as one of the tests that can be performed while the rod withdrawal
limiter is in the bypassed condition. 
Entergy Operations, Inc. has requested the amendment at this time due to the fact that a small fuel leak was recently
identified to exist in the reactor core at RBS. As a result of this leak the licensee has identified an increase in off-gas
activity and off-site dose. Although these increases have not exceeded RBS off-site dose limits, the potential exists
for further fuel degradation caused by either normal power changes, which are needed to perform various TS surveillance
tests, or inadvertent power excursions. Finally, should the leaking fuel bundle continue to degrade, RBS will be
forced to de-rate to maintain off-gas activity within TS requirements. This could ultimately result in forcing the
plant to shutdown to locate and remove the leaking fuel. Entergy Operations, Inc. has determined that if the location
of the fuel leak can be identified, actions could be taken to suppress the leak, and to prevent further degradation.
As a result, Entergy Operations, Inc. believes that the circumstances described above meets the requirements for
emergency action per 10 CFR 50.91(a)(5). 
The licensee's request was reviewed by the Commission and was found not to meet the requirements for emergency action
as specified in 10 CFR 50.91(a)(5), but it was determined that the licensee's concerns were valid and did merit exigent
action as specified in 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6). 
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



(1) The request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The event of concern is the rod withdrawal error at power, which is assumed to occur when the highest worth control rod
is withdrawn while at a limiting critical power ratio condition. The rod withdrawal limiter provides protection
for control rod withdrawal error events. The purpose of the rod withdrawal limiter is to limit control rod withdrawal
to preclude a violation of a fuel design limit. 
Administrative controls for bypassing the rod withdrawal limiter constraints in the rod pattern control system
will include; direct control to be maintained and an approved procedure to be used to control the bypassing of individual
control rods in the rod pattern control system. A test specific analysis will be performed assuming the rod withdrawal
error occurs and a test pattern will be administratively imposed (i.e. controlled by procedure) that precludes any
violation of fuel safety limits. 
Performance of the power suppression testing with rod withdrawal limiter notch constraints bypassed will be more
conservative since the bypassed control rod will not be withdrawn past its original pre-test position. The expected
test conditions for which the power suppression test will be performed will also be much less than the assumed limiting
thermal limit conditions expected by the safety analysis. therefore, the evolution is less severe than that assumed
in the safety analysis. 
If an operator continuously withdraws a previously partially inserted control rod to its original position or beyond,
an analysis will show there is no increase in the consequences of a rod withdrawal error of the type described in the
basis for Technical Specification 3.10.2. Therefore, the rod pattern control system sequence constraints are not
required for this special test, and the operation of the plant will remain as previously analyzed with the response
of the plant within the limits of the analyses. 
(2) The request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

Performance of the power suppression testing performed under the proposed change will be more conservative than
previously reviewed events since the rod pattern control system bypassed control rod will not be withdrawn past its
original pre-test position. Therefore, the power suppression testing evolution is less severe than that assumed
in the safety analysis and the response of the plant will remain within previous analysis. 
The positioning of control rods will be in conformance with applicable safety analysis; the generic rod withdrawal
error analysis or with a special analysis, to ensure that the conclusions of the rod withdrawal error analysis remains
supported. The maintenance of these analysis limits will be through the use of administrative controls. 
The use of operational control in lieu of control rod blocks will assure this analysis remains supported. This action
is consistent with present allowances in Technical Specification 3.10.2. Therefore the above administrative controls
ensure that positioning and movement of bypassed control rods remain within the bounds of the previous analysis.

(3) The request does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Technical Specifications currently allow bypassing a single control rod for the purpose of fully withdrawing the
control rod to perform the four tests specified in Technical Specification 3.10.2 The margin of safety associated
with the bypassing and withdrawal of control rods is established in the Technical Specifications for control rod
scram time testing. Also the controls being placed on power suppression testing will assure fuel safety limits are
met. Therefore, the margin of safety associated with power suppression testing is enveloped by the margin of safety
defined for current control rod testing. 
Therefore, the analysis, the hardware controls, and the administrative requirements all support and meet the requirements
of General Design Criteria 10, Fuel Design Limits are not exceeded; 25, Protection System requirements for Reactivity;
and 29, Protection against Anticipated Operational Occurrences.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m., to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. 
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By October 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to relay to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determinations is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William D. Beckner: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mark Weterhahn, Esq., Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20005,
attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 8, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at Government Documents Department, Louisiana

<DOCTITLE>Dr. William F. Kusmik; Order Prohibiting Involvement in Certain NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>



I



Creative Biomolecules, Inc. (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct License No. 20-20592-01 (License) issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30. The License authorizes the Licensee
to use certain stated byproduct materials for research and development as defined in Section 30.4(q) of 10 CFR Part
30. At the time of an NRC inspection in November 1992, Dr. William F. Kusmik was the Radiation Safety Officer at the facility.
The License, originally issued on April 20, 1983, was amended in its entirety on March 3, 1993, and was due to expire
on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect since that time due to a timely renewal request made pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b).



II



On November 10-11, 1992, the NRC performed an inspection at the Licensee's facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.
During the inspection, the NRC identified numerous violations of NRC requirements. As a result of the inspection
findings, a Confirmatory Action Letter was issued to the Licensee on November 12, 1992. The inspector also found indications
that information provided by Dr. William F. Kusmik (the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) at the facility at the time
of an NRC inspection in November 1992) in a letter dated September 21, 1992, did not appear to be accurate, and that records
of monthly wipe tests at the facility may have been falsified. As a result, an investigation was conducted by the NRC
Office of Investigations (0I).

As a result of the 0I investigation, a transcribed enforcement conference was conducted on June 7, 1994, with Dr. Kusmik,
to address whether he: (1) deliberately directed a Licensee employee to falsify certain NRC-required wipe test records;
and (2) deliberately provided false or misleading information to the NRC in a letter dated September 21, 1992, in response
to a previous Notice of Violation (Notice) issued by the NRC on July 29, 1992.

With respect to the issue of records falsification, Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that in
1991 he directed an employee to fabricate records of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990
and February 1991), even though the tests had not been performed for those months.

With respect to the information provided in the September 21, 1992 letter sent to the NRC under Dr. Kusmik's signature,
Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that he had stated in the letter that certain actions had been
taken in response to NRC inspection findings articulated in the July 29, 1992 letter and Notice, when, in fact, those
stated actions had not been taken. Specifically, in response to the July 29, 1992 Notice involving the failure to perform
surveys of a certain laboratory required to be performed by License Condition 14, the September 21, 1991 letter stated
that ``To avoid a repetition of these discrepancies, three individuals within the laboratory have been trained to
perform these surveys.'' This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik stated during the enforcement conference
that while he intended to provide such training, no such training subsequent to the July 29, 1992 Notice had been provided
at the time Dr. Kusmik signed and sent the September 21, 1992 letter to the NRC. In addition, in response to a concern
expressed in the NRC's July 29, 1992 letter transmitting the Notice, involving the licensee's plans to obtain access
to a thyroid phantom or some other method to quantitatively determine thyroid uptakes of personnel, the licensee's
September 21, 1992 letter stated that ``A calibrated survey meter with a Sodium Iodine [iodide] crystal has been recalibrated
for thyroid counting using a thyroid phantom consisting of a plexiglas block approximately three inches thick.''
This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that the sodium iodide
crystal had not been recalibrated at the time he had signed and sent the letter to the NRC.

Based on the above, the NRC has concluded that in 1991, Dr. Kusmik caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a).
Specifically, Dr. Kusmik deliberately directed an employee to fabricate records, required to be maintained by the
License, of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990 and February 1991), even though the tests
had not been performed during those months. In addition, on September 21, 1992, Dr Kusmik violated 10 CFR 30.10(a)
by engaging in deliberate misconduct that caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a). Specifically,
Dr. Kusmik deliberately submitted to the NRC false information in the September 21, 1992 letter in which he stated
that: (1) three individuals within the laboratory had been trained to perform surveys; and (2) a calibrated survey
meter with a Sodium Iodide crystal had been recalibrated for thyroid counting.



III



As a result, the NRC has serious concerns regarding Dr. Kusmik's performance and supervision of NRC-licensed activities,
and in particular, the supervision of such activities. The actions of Dr. Kusmik, described above, were particularly
serious since, as the RSO at the facility, Dr. Kusmik was charged with ensuring that Licensee staff adhered to requirements
and performed activities in a safe manner. Rather than properly discharging those responsibilities, Dr. Kusmik
set an unacceptable example for the individuals to whom he gave direction, as well as to others engaged in NRC-licensed
activities at the facility.

<PARENT> FR940916-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While Dr. Kusmik did not cooperate during the OI investigation, he did provide information during the transcribed
enforcement conference on June 7, 1994. Specifically, Dr. Kusmik stated that he: (1) directed an employee to falsify
NRC-required wipe test records; and (2) provided false or misleading information to the NRC in a letter, dated September
21, 1992, in response to a Notice of Violation. The NRC recognizes Dr. Kusmik was candid and straightforward with the
NRC when questioned during the enforcement conference. The NRC also recognizes that Dr. Kusmik was contrite and expressed
remorse for his actions. However, Dr. Kusmik's actions cannot and will not be tolerated by the NRC. Consequently,
I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that information provided to the NRC by Dr. Kusmik, or required to be maintained
by Dr. Kusmik or the Licensee, will be complete and accurate in all material respects, and that the health and safety
of the public will be protected if Dr. Kusmik were permitted at this time to be an authorized user listed on any NRC license
or act as an RSO.

Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that Dr. Kusmik: (1) be prohibited from being an authorized
user and from acting as an RSO for a period of one year from the date of this Order; (2) for a period of three years from the
date of the Order, notify the NRC within 20 days of his acceptance of an employment offer involving NRC-licensed activities;
and (3) Dr. Kusmik, within 30 days from the date of this Order, provide a statement of his commitment to comply with NRC
requirements and the basis why the Commission should have confidence that he will comply with applicable NRC requirements.
Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the conduct described above is such that the
public health, safety and interest require that this Order be effective immediately.



IV 



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 30.10, 

it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that:

A. Dr. William F. Kusmik is prohibited from being an authorized user and from acting as an RSO on any NRC license for a
period of one year from the date of this Order. During this one-year period, an NRC licensee may allow Dr. Kusmik to perform
NRC-licensed activities only if he is under the direct supervision of an authorized user as defined below. NRC-licensed
activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including,
but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by
10 CFR 150.20. During this time period, Dr. Kusmik must also provide a copy of this Order to prospective employers who
engage in NRC-licensed activities.

Supervision of Dr. Kusmik during this period shall be performed as follows:

1. The licensee must document the name of the authorized user responsible for supervising Dr. Kusmik's activities
and ensuring compliance with all applicable NRC requirements.

2. The authorized user supervising Dr. Kusmik shall routinely observe and review all radiological safety records
generated by Dr. Kusmik's activities. On monthly basis, records generated by Dr. Kusmik will be reviewed and initialed
by the supervising authorized user to assure that the records are complete and accurate. Any record found not to be
in accordance with NRC requirements shall be reported to the RSO.

an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Dr. Kusmik, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspension, unfounded allegations, or error.

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An Answer Or a Request For Hearing Shall Not Stay The Immediate
Effectiveness of This Order.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Electric Power Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-24 and DPR-27, issued to Wisconsin Electric Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin.
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) Section 15.4.2, ``In-Service Inspection of Safety
Class Components,'' by incorporating the use of acceptance criteria to allow sleeved tubes with certain upper sleeve
parent tube indications to remain in service as described in Westinghouse Electric Corporation's report, WCAP-14157,
``Technical Evaluation of Hybrid Expansion Joint (HEJ) Sleeved Tubes With Indications Within the Upper Joint Zone.''
The basis for TS Section 15.4.2 would also be revised to support the above changes.
WCAP-14157 documents the technical justification and outlines the particular aspects of proposed criteria
to support the continued safe operation of sleeved tubes with circumferential indications of up to 360
  in the HEJ hardroll lower transition region of HEJ sleeved tubes. The criteria limit the end of cycle (EOC) crack
angles existing within the lower transition to 224
 , as measured using a motorized rotating pancake coil (MRPC) probe. The criteria include an allowance for postulated
steam line break primary-to-secondary leakage for each sleeved tube which is permitted to remain in operation due
to application of the criteria. The proposed criteria also redefine the portion of the parent tube considered to be
part of the pressure boundary. The portion of the parent tube below the bottom of the HEJ hardroll lower transition
would no longer be considered to be within the scope of the primary pressure boundary. The criteria would be implemented
in concert with an operational leakage limit of 150 gallons per day and enhanced inspection criteria designed to quantify
the size and location of potential crack-like indications.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
By October 17, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714,
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street, Two Rivers,
Wisconsin 54241. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

AGENCY:

 Office of Management and Budget.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Revision to OMB Circular A-122.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on a proposed revision to Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-profit Organizations.'' The revision will allow Federal
agencies to reimburse non-profit organizations for interest on debt used to finance the purchase of buildings and
equipment, when purchasing using debt financing is less costly than leasing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this revision is to: (1) Encourage non-profit organizations to acquire building space and equipment
necessary for administering Federal programs at the lowest possible cost, and (2) bring consistency to Federal policies
covering the allowability of interest by organizations receiving Federal awards.



The revision will apply only to assets acquired after its final issuance.


</SUPPLEM>
<SIGNER>
John B. Arthur,


</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Assistant Director for Administration.





The following paragraph is proposed to replace paragraph 19.a of Attachment A to Circular A-122:

19. Interest, fund raising, and investment management costs.

a. Interest.

(1) Interest on debt is unallowable unless:

(a) The non-profit organization performs a lease/purchase analysis in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,
Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' and OMB Circular A-94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for
Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' sections 5a, 8(c)(2), and 13, which shows that purchasing through
debt financing is less costly to the Federal Government than leasing. Discount rates used should be equal to the grantee's
borrowing rates, to be consistent with Circular A-94's intent to reflect the entity's cost of financing. The
financial analysis must include a comparison of the present value of the projected total cash flows of both alternatives
over the period the asset is expected to be used by the non-profit organization in carrying out federally sponsored
activities. The cash flows associated with purchasing the asset must include the purchase price, anticipated operating
and maintenance costs (including property taxes, if applicable) not included in the debt financing, less any estimated
asset salvage value at the end of the period defined above. Projected rental costs should be based on the anticipated
cost of renting comparable facilities or equipment at fair market rates over the period defined above, and any expected
maintenance costs and property taxes to be borne by the non-profit organization directly or as part of the lease arrangement.


(b) Financing is provided at an interest rate no higher than the fair market rate.

(c) Investment earnings, including interest, on bond or loan principal, pending payment of the construction or acquisition
costs, are used to offset allowable interest cost. Arbitrage earnings reportable to the Internal Revenue Service
are not required to be offset against allowable interest costs.

(d) Where the Federal Government's reimbursement is expected to equal or exceed 51 percent of an asset's cost, the
non-profit organization conducts an assessment that demonstrates the need for the asset in the conduct of federally
sponsored activities. For assets costing in excess of $10 million, the needs assessment must be approved in advance
by the cognizant Federal agency as a prerequisite to the allowability of depreciation and interest on debt related
to the facility. For assets costing less than $10 million, the needs assessment must be maintained on file for review
by the Federal Government.

(2) Interest on debt issued to finance or refinance assets acquired before or reacquired after the effective date
of this policy is not allowable.

(3) Federal cognizant agencies shall require non-profit organizations to compute interest on the excess of the depreciation
and interest reimbursement over the bond principal and interest payments, and that the organizations treat the computed
interest as a reduction in the interest expense to be reimbursed by the Federal Government. This provision is not applicable
in instances where the non-profit organization makes an initial equity contribution of 25 percent or more to purchase
the asset(s).

(4) Substantial relocation of federally sponsored activities from a facility financed by indebtedness, the cost
of which was funded in whole or part through Federal reimbursements, to another facility prior to the expiration of
the useful life of the facility requires Federal cognizant agency approval. The extent of the relocation, the amount
of the Federal participation in the financing, and the depreciation charged to date may require negotiation of space
charges for Federal programs.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of
a Proposed Rule Change Relating to DTC's Enhancement of its Repo Tracking System


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (``Act'')
 notice is hereby given that on July 27, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by DTC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change consists of two enhancements to DTC's Repo Tracking System (``RTS''). The first enhancement
enables a participant of DTC to instruct DTC to eliminate that participant's obligation to DTC for a specific payment
date on a CUSIP and to eliminate the corresponding entitlement of the participant's counterparty on that payment
date. The second enhancement replaces the single ``catchall'' Repo position for each participant with a series of
Repo position memo accounts, one for each counterparty of that participant.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most
significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of this proposed rule change is to provide a repo buyer an instruction to inform DTC to inhibit the buyer's
debit for a specific income payment on a CUSIP and to inhibit the corresponding income payment to the counterparty.
DTC's current RTS procedures include a Repo Deliver Order instruction (``DO'' with Reason Code 81), a Repo Reclaim
instruction (also Reason Code 81), and a Repo Adjustment instruction.
 The first two instructions effect book-entry transfer of securities and also instruct DTC to adjust certain accounts,
called ``Repo positions,'' of participants. The third instruction, which can be issued only by a participant that
is forfeiting the right to receive future distributions, instructs DTC to adjust Repo positions without effecting
book-entry transfers of securities.




DTC's existing procedures provide for the participant obligated for future distributions (

i.e.,

 the repo buyer) to instruct DTC to negate that obligation.
 DTC will eliminate the participant's obligation on future distributions and the counterparty's (

i.e.,

 the repo seller) entitlement to the future distributions upon receipt of a letter of instruction in a prescribed form
from the obligated participant. The proposed rule change provides that DTC will eliminate the participant's obligation
on a specific distribution and the counterparty's corresponding entitlement to the specific distribution upon
receipt of a letter of instruction in a prescribed form from the obligated participant.




DTC will accept the instructions from two days before the distribution payment date until 11:30 a.m. (Eastern) on
the distribution payment date. DTC will require the instructing participant to notify the counterparty participant,
and the non-participant counterparty where applicable, of the instructions to DTC.
After DTC receives an instruction, on distribution payment date it will process a cash adjustment offsetting the
RTS entry through the cash adjustment (``CADJ'') function on participants terminal system (``PTS''). The repo seller
will receive an unsolicited message describing the offsetting adjustment over the PTS network. This information
also will be accessible through the CADJ inquiry capability. The repo buyer's daily settlement statement on payment
date will show a debit automatically effected by RTS and a credit of equal amount effected by CADJ, and the repo seller's
daily settlement statement on payment date will show an RTS credit offset by a CADJ debit. The CADJ adjustment will
be final and will not be reversed if the repo seller fails to settle with DTC that day.





When DTC receives instructions to eliminate the obligated participant's obligation with respect to a specific distribution,
DTC will implement the instructing participant's instructions without making any determination about the parties'
legal obligations to each other. The parties to the repo transaction will then be responsible for settling that particular
distribution payment outside of RTS. DTC will not be responsible for processing any further entries on the payment.
The repo buyer's instructions will apply only to that particular distribution, and subsequent distributions will
be tracked in RTS as usual.
Currently, RTS has a single catchall repo position in which all of a participant's obligations and entitlements are
aggregated. The proposed rule change will establish a separate repo position memo account for each participant with
each of its counterparties. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to give participants easier access to information
about their RTS obligation and entitlements.

<TEXT>
 

If any participant of DTC becomes insolvent or DTC ceases to act on its behalf, DTC's existing RTS procedures will unwind
all of the participant's Repo positions to eliminate any DTC obligations to automatically allocate future distributions
created by past RTS transactions with the terminated participant (without affecting the courterparties' legal
obligations of right with respect to the terminated participant). Before permitting a participant to voluntarily
retire, DTC will verify that the retiring participant has closed out all its entitlements and obligations for future
distributions created by past Repo instructions.


The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, specifically with section 17A of the Act,
and the rules and regulations thereunder because it facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions by giving users of DTC's RTS the same degree of control over income on securities that they
have outside DTC and by improving RTS users' access to information about their RTS obligations and entitlements.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




DTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



(C) Shelf-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others




DTC developed the specific payment date RTS inhibition in response to participants' requests to add this flexibility
to existing RTS. Under the existing RTS, returns of principal on securities that return principal in periodic payments
until maturity, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), are paid to the repo sellers with the exception
of the final payment at maturity. The final payment at maturity and redemption proceeds on other types of securities
are paid to the repo buyers regardless of RTS status. In addition, a repo buyer may direct that all future distributions
on a security be paid to it rather than the seller, consistent with the Master Repurchase Agreement of the Public Securities
Association.


However, participants perceived a need for specific single payment date RTS inhibition in cases such as when a CMO
periodic payment before the final payment includes a principal component large enough to significantly affect the
value of the collateral securing the repo. This can happen because of the volume of mortgage prepayments. For example,
on a multi-tranche CMO a particular tranche might not be receiving any principal payments (with those payments allocated
to earlier tranches), but then due to prepayments paying down the earlier tranches that tranche might suddenly receive
a sizeable prepayment of principal. One participant reported incidents where the prepayment amounted to 50% or more
of the value of the tranches. DTC's review of its records spotted numerous prepayments exceeding 10% of tranche value
with some as high as 85%. Although the tranche remains outstanding, its value as repo collateral is dramatically decreased,
and the repo buyer is exposed to significant credit risk until the mark-to-the-market payment is received.


While a repo buyer faced with risk because of a large intermediate principal paydown could eliminate the risk by instructing
DTC to redirect all future distributions on the CUSIP to the repo buyer instead of the repo seller,
 such action would deprive both the repo buyer and the repo seller of the advantages of RTS for future distributions
on the CUSIP. Participants thus requested a more restricted method of inhibiting an RTS payout. The proposed rule
change was developed after a number of conference with participants. DTC received a written comment from the Dividend
Division of the Securities Industry Association supporting the proposed amendment to Repo tracking.







The software to support individual repo position memo accounts for each participant-counterparty combination
was developed for stock loan income tracking, a proposed rule change that was filed separately.
 Once the programming was done, it was cost-effective to import it into RTS to improve participants's access to RTS
information.





III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action




The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act and Rule 19b-4(e)(4)
thereunder because it effects a change in an existing service of DTC that does not adversely affect the safeguarding
of securities or funds in the custody or control of DTC or for which DTC is responsible and does not significantly affect
the respective rights or obligations of DTC or its participants. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such
proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that
such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room at the address above.


Copies of such filing also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of DTC. All submissions
should refer to the file Number SR-DTC-94-12 and should be submitted by October 7, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Storage of Option Customer Account Information for Supervisory Purposes</DOCTITLE>


September 12, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 5, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Paragraph (d), ``Maintenance of Customer Records,'' of PHLX Rule 1025, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' requires member
organizations to maintain at the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory
office background and financial information of customers who have been approved for options transactions. In addition,
Commentary .03 to PHLX Rule 1025 requires member organizations to maintain, at the principal supervisory office
with jurisdiction over the office servicing the customer's account, information to permit review of each customer's
options account to determine the compatibility of options transactions with investment objectives, the size and
frequency of options transactions, commission activity in the account, profit or loss in the account, undue concentration
in any options class or classes, and compliance with the provisions of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The
PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1025(d) and Commentary 0.3 to allow member organizations to maintain the required
customer information and account statements off-site, rather than at the principal supervisory office, as long
as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

Currently, PHLX Rule 1025 requires written procedures for the review and maintenance of customer options accounts.
Specifically, paragraph (d) requires that backgrounds, financial information and copies of account statements
respecting option-approved accounts be maintained at the branch office servicing that customer's account as well
as at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch office. The PHLX proposes that the requirement
applicable to principal supervisory offices be amended to permit the required information to be maintained at another
location, provided that the information is readily accessible and promptly retrievable. The record retention requirement
applicable to branch offices remains unchanged, such that off-site record maintenance is not permissible.

The PHLX states that the increasing use of computers, fax machines, optical disk and other technology coupled with
the expense of storing records on-site have resulted in more member organizations storing records away from their
principal supervisory offices.
 The PHLX states that corresponding amendments to exchange option rules relating to customer account records are
now required, and that the other self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') have enacted similar amendments to their
rules
 or are proposing the same to their respective rules in order to maintain uniformity among the SROs respecting option
account rules.






In view of technological advances, the Exchange believes that it is appropriate to permit the off-site storage of
customer records previously required to be maintained at a principal supervisory office. Technological advances
such as optical storage technology may enable broker-dealers to improve customer service, due to the speedier and
higher quality access to records that optical disks afford. The Exchange also believes that off-site storage should
not compromise the supervisory obligations of member/participant organizations because the customer information
necessary to fulfill those responsibilities must be easily accessible and promptly retrievable.

Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general,
and, in particular with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
as well as to protect investors and the public interest. While facilitating the storage concerns and technological
needs of member organizations whose principal supervisory offices would be affected, the PHLX believes that the
proposed change to PHLX Rule 1025(d) should nevertheless safeguard the customer protection purposes of maintaining
customer account information because the information would continue to be readily accessible and promptly retrievable,
merely at a different, usually central, location. As a result, the PHLX believes that the Exchange's ability to investigate
and access option customer account records would be preserved, and possibly enhanced, as computer technology advances.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members Participants
or Others



No written comments were either received or requested.




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or

(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by October 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Composite Bond & Stock Fund, Inc.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



September 12, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act''). 





APPLICANTS: 

Composite Bond & Stock Fund, Inc., Composite Growth Fund, Inc., Composite Northwest 50 Fund, Inc., Composite
U.S. Government Securities, Inc., Composite Income Fund, Inc., Composite Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Inc., Composite
Cash Management Company, Composite Deferred Series, Inc. (collectively, the ``Funds''), and Composite Research
& Management Co. (the ``Adviser''). 




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order to permit the Funds to pool uninvested cash in joint accounts and invest the cash in short-term
repurchase agreements and commercial paper.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




APPLICANT'S REPRESENTATIONS: 





1. Each Fund is a registered open-end management investment company. The Funds and any series thereof are collectively
referred to as ``Portfolios.'' The Adviser provides investment advisory and management services to the Portfolios,
Murphey Favre Securities Services, Inc. provides administrative services to the Portfolios, and Investors Fiduciary
Trust Company (the ``Custodian'') is the Portfolios' custodian. Applicants request relief for themselves, future
series of the Funds, and all other registered management investment companies and series thereof that in the future
are advised by the Adviser. 

2. At the end of each trading day, most of the Portfolios usually have uninvested cash balances in their accounts at
the Custodian. Applicants request an order to permit the Portfolios to deposit some or all of their uninvested cash
in a single joint account. The cash in the account then would be invested in short-term repurchase agreements and commercial
paper. 

3. The joint account would enter into repurchase agreements collateralized only by U.S. Government or agency securities.
Each repurchase agreement investment would satisfy the investment criteria of any Portfolio participating in such
investment. The joint repurchase transactions will be effected in accordance with Investment Company Act Release
No. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) and with other existing and future positions the Commission or its staff may take by rule, interpretive
release, no-action letter, release adopting any new rule, release adopting any amendments to any existing rule,
or otherwise. 

4. The joint account also would invest in interest bearing or discounted commercial paper. All commercial paper purchased
by the joint account will be a ``First-Tier security'' as defined in rule 2a-7 under the Act. Each commercial
paper investment also would satisfy the investment criteria of any Portfolio participating in such investment.
As with repurchase agreements, applicants acknowledge they have an obligation to monitor published statements
of the SEC on commercial paper transactions, and in the event the SEC sets forth guidelines with respect to commercial
paper, each Portfolio participating in commercial paper transactions made through the joint account will conform
its investments to such guidelines and will adopt any appropriate standards and guidelines. 

5. The Adviser would decide whether to invest cash balances in the joint account in repurchase agreements and/or commercial
paper. The joint account may invest in more than one repurchase agreement or commercial paper instrument. Each Portfolio
participating in the joint account would not necessarily have its cash balances invested in every repurchase agreement
or commercial paper instrument purchased through the joint account: Certain Portfolios' investment restrictions
may preclude their participation in a given repurchase agreement or commercial paper instrument. Moreover, some
Portfolios' cash balances may become available too late in the day to be included in repurchase agreements that already
have been negotiated. 

6. The directors of each Fund have considered the proposed joint account and determined that participation in the
joint account would benefit each participating Portfolio. Although the Adviser will gain some benefit through administrative
convenience and a possible reduction in clerical costs, the primary beneficiaries will be the Portfolios because
the joint account will be a more efficient way of administering investment transactions.

Applicants' Analysis:



1. Section 17(d) of the Act makes it unlawful for an affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as
principal, to effect any transaction in which the registered investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant
with such person in contravention of rules and regulations proscribed by the SEC. Rule 17d-1(a) provides that
an affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as principal, shall not participate in, or effect
any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the registered investment
company is a participant unless the SEC has issued an order approving the arrangement.

2. Each Portfolio, by participating in the proposed account, and the Adviser, by managing the proposed account, may
be joint participants in a transaction within the meaning of section 17(d), and the proposed account may constitute
a joint enterprise or other type of joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d-1. Furthermore, each applicant
may be an affiliated person of each other applicant.

3. Although not every Portfolio participating in the joint account will have an interest in every instrument purchased
through the joint account, to the extent a Portfolio has an interest in a particular repurchase agreement or commercial
paper instrument, its interest will be proportionate to its cash contribution to the purchase price of such repurchase
agreement or commercial paper instrument, and will be computed on the same basis as every other participant in such
repurchase agreement or commercial paper instrument. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested order
is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act.

4. Applicants also believe that the proposed joint account arrangement could result in the following significant
benefits for the Portfolios: (a) an increase of approximately 0.5% in the annual rate of return on the Portfolios'
short-term investments in repurchase agreements; (b) an increased ability to invest funds that otherwise might
not be invested; and (c) an enhanced ability to negotiate reductions in transaction fees.

5. Applicants believe that the method of operating the joint account would not result in any conflicts of interest
between any of the Portfolios or between any Portfolio and the Adviser, and that the operation of the joint account
would be free of any inherent bias favoring one Portfolio over another.



Applicants' Conditions:



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions.

1. A separate custodial cash account at the Custodian will be established for the joint account into which each Portfolio
may deposit uninvested cash balances at the end of each trading day. The joint account will not be distinguishable
from other accounts maintained by any Portfolio with the Custodian except that monies of the Portfolios will be commingled.
The account will not have any separate existence with indicia of a separate legal entity. The sole function of the custodial
joint account will be to provide a convenient way of aggregating individual transactions necessary for management
of the Portfolios' respective daily uninvested cash balances.

2. Cash in the joint account will be invested in one or more repurchase agreement transactions and/or commercial paper
transactions. All repurchase agreement and commercial paper transactions will have, with rare exceptions, an overnight,
over-the-weekend, or over-the-holiday maturity, and in no even will have a maturity of more than seven days.

3. Each Portfolio will participate in a given investment through the joint account only to the extent consistent with
its investment objectives, policies and restrictions.

4. The Adviser and the custodian will maintain records (in conformity with section 31 of the Act and rules and regulations
thereunder) documenting, for any given day, such Portfolio's aggregate investment in the joint account and its pro
rata share of each investment made through the joint account in which it participates.

5. Repurchase agreements will be ``collateralized fully'' as defined in rule 2a-7 under the Act and satisfy
the uniform standards set by the Portfolios for such investments. The securities subject to the repurchase agreement
will be transferred to the Portfolio, the Portfolio's custodian, or a third party that qualifies as a custodian under
the Act. The securities will not be held by the Portfolios' repurchase counterparty or by an affiliated person of that
counterparty. 

6. Each Portfolio relying upon rule 2a-7 for valuation of its net assets based on amortized cost will use the average
maturity of the repurchase agreements purchased by the Portfolio participating in the account when computing the
Portfolio's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portion of its assets held in such account on that day.


7. No Portfolio will be allowed to create a negative balance in the joint account for any reason, although it will be
permitted to draw down its entire balance at any time. Each Portfolio's decision to invest in the joint account or in
any given investment made through the joint account will be solely at its option. Nor Portfolio will be obligated either
to invest in the joint account or in any given investment in the joint account or to maintain any minimum balance in the
joint account.

8. The Adviser will administer the investment of the cash balances in and operation of the joint account as part of its
duties under the general terms of each Portfolio's existing or any future investment advisory contract and will not
collect any additional or separate fees for the management of the joint account.

9. The administration of the joint account would be within the fidelity bond coverage required by section 17(g) of
the Act and rule 17g-1 thereunder.

10. Each Fund participating in the joint account will adopt procedures pursuant to which the joint account will operate,
which will be reasonably designed to provide that the requirements of the application will be met. The directors of
each Fund will make and approve changes they deem necessary to ensure that such procedures are followed. In addition,
the directors of each Fund will determine, no less frequently than annually, whether the joint account has been operated
in accordance with such procedures.

Entergy Corp., et al. (70-8449)



Arkansas Power & Light Co. (``AP&L''), 425 West Capitol Avenue, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72201, Gulf States
Utilities Co. (``GSU''), Edison Plaza, 350 Pine Street, Beaumont, Texas, 77704, Louisiana Power & Light Co.
(``LP&L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70113, Mississippi Power & Light Co. (``MP&L''),
308 East Pearl Street, Jackson, Mississippi, 39201, and New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (``NOPSI''), 639 Loyola
Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70113, all utility subsidiaries (``Utilities'') of Entergy Corp. (``Entergy''),
225 Baronne Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, as well as System Energy Resources, Inc. (``SERI''), 1340 Echelon
Parkway, Jackson, Mississippi, 39213, a utility subsidiary of Entergy, Entergy Services, Inc. (``ESI''), 639 Loyola
Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70113, a non-utility subsidiary of Entergy, System Fuels, Inc. (``System Fuels''),
Three Lakeway Center, 3838 North Causeway Boulevard, Metairie, Louisiana, 70003, a non-utility subsidiary of Entergy,
and Entergy Operations, Inc. (``EOI''), 1340 Echelon Parkway, Jackson, Mississippi, 39213, a utility subsidiary
of Entergy, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and Rules
43 and 45 thereunder.

The Utilities and SERI propose to continue to finance their interim capital needs through loans from a money pool and
through the issuance and sale of unsecured short-term notes and commercial paper through November 30, 1996. Entergy,
ESI, EOI, and System Fuels also propose to continue to participate in the same money pool through November 30, 1996
and to extend certain loan agreements.

In orders dated November 18, 1992 (HCAR No. 25680) (``1992 Order''), March 14, 1994 (HCAR No. 26010), and April 21,
1994 (HCAR No. 26033), the Utilities and SERI are authorized through November 30, 1994, to make unsecured short-term
loans through the Entergy System Money Pool (``Money Pool'') and to issue and sell unsecured short-term notes and
commercial paper to various commercial banks to meet their respective interim capital requirements. In addition,
in the 1992 Order, Entergy, ESI, System Fuels, and EOI are authorized to participate in the Money Pool through November
30, 1994. The Money Pool is composed of available funds invested by the companies that participate in the Money Pool,
which funds can be borrowed by those companies other than Entergy to meet their respective interim capital requirements.

In orders dated June 5, 1990 (HCAR No. 25100) and April 29, 1992 (HCAR No. 25526), and in the 1992 Order, EOI is authorized
through November 30, 1994 to (i) borrow from Entergy up to $15 million pursuant to a June 6, 1990 loan agreement (``EOI
Loan Agreement'') and an additional $5 million over which the Commission has reserved jurisdiction and (ii) enter
into loan agreements with banks to reduce the amount Entergy committed to EOI under the EOI Loan Agreement. Loans under
the EOI Loan Agreement are evidence by a note that matures on November 30, 1994 (``EOI Note''), which obligates EOI
to remit the $15 million or the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all loans thereunder.

In orders dated September 17, 1991 (HCAR No. 25376) and October 23, 1991 (HCAR No. 25395), and in the 1992 Order, ESI
is authorized through November 30, 1994 to (i) borrow from Entergy up $90 million pursuant to a September 18, 1994 loan
agreement (``ESI Loan Agreement'') and (ii) enter into loan agreements with banks to reduce the amount of Entergy
committed to ESI under the Loan Agreement. Loans under the ESI Loan Agreement are evidenced by a note that matures on
November 30, 1994 (``ESI Note''), which obligates ESI to remit the full $90 million or the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all loans thereunder.

The Utilities and SERI propose to continue to finance their interim capital needs through loans from the Money Pool
and through the issuance and sale of unsecured short-term notes and commercial paper through November 30, 1996. The
maximum amount of loans, notes, and commercial paper would be $243 million for AP&L, $395 million for GSU, $236
million for LP&L, $108 million for MP&L, $39 million for NOPSI, and $195 million for SERI. Entergy, ESI, EOI,
and System Fuels propose to continue to participate in the Money Pool through November 30, 1996. In addition, EOI and
Entergy propose to (i) extend the EOI Loan Agreement and the EOI Note through November 30, 1996 and (ii) extend the authorization
for loan agreements with banks through November 30, 1996. Finally, ESI and Entergy propose to (i) increase the amount
of the ESI Loan Agreement from $90 million to $150 million and extend the ESI Loan Agreement and the ESI Note through
November 30, 1996 and (ii) extend the authorization for loan agreements with banks through November 30, 1996 and increase
the amount of the loan agreements from $90 million to $150 million.

The Utilities and SERI request that the Commission reserve jurisdiction over loans from the Money Pool and the issuance
and sale of notes and commercial paper in excess of $125 million for AP&L, $125 million for GSU, $150 million for
LP&L, $100 million for MP&L, $39 million for NOPSI, $125 million for SERI. The Utilities, SERI, Entergy,
ESI, EOI, and System Fuels (``Companies'') propose to participate in the Money Pool, which will continue to be administered
by ESI. The Money Pool will consist of funds from the Companies loaned on a short-term basis to other Companies_besides
Entergy_or invested. The Companies will not borrow funds to participate in the Money Pool. Entergy will invest in
the Money Pool but under no circumstances will Entergy be permitted to borrow funds from the Money Pool.

The Money Pool will be managed to match the available cash and capital requirements of the Companies to minimize the
need for loans by the Companies from external sources. However, the Companies might make some short-term loans or
issue some commercial paper to maintain a market presence. The Utilities and SERI will have a priority on funds from
the Money Pool_ESI, System Fuels, and EOI will be permitted to borrow through the Money Pool if there are additional
funds available. If the available funds in the Money Pool are insufficient for the short-term capital requirements
of the Utilities or SERI, those Companies will use external loans through banks and sales of commercial paper.

It is proposed that certain operative limitations as ESI, EOI, and system Fuels loans through the Money Pool be maintained.
First, the aggregate amount of loans by ESI will never exceed an amount equal to the aggregate unused portion of credit
then available under the ESI Loan Agreement and other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by ESI with Commission
approval. Second, the aggregate amount of loans by EOI will never exceed an amount equal to the aggregate unused portion
of credit then available under the EOI Loan Agreement and other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by EOI
with Commission approval. Third, the aggregate amount of loans by SERI will never exceed the amount equal to the aggregate
unused portion of credit then available to SERI under other credit arrangements hereafter entered into by SERI upon
Commission approval with commercial banks or other entities.






Some SERI credit arrangements require, in the absence of waivers, the Money Pool loans be subordinated indebtedness
to the extent that, under certain circumstances_for example, a default under the credit arrangements_no remittance
by SERI of principal or interest on Money Pool loans would be permitted until all obligations under such credit arrangements
have been discharged. The System Fuels-Bank of America credit agreement requires that Money Pool loans be subordinated
to the extent that, under certain circumstances_for example, a default under the credit agreement_no remittance
by System Fuels, without the consent of Bank of America, of principal or interest on Money Pool loans would be permitted.

ESI will invest funds not loaned to the Companies and will allocate the return on those investments to the Companies
that provided the excess funds on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective interests in such funds. ESI
proposes to invest the excess funds in securities permitted by Section 9(c) of the Act and Rule 40 thereunder.

The Utilities and SERI, ESI, System Fuels, and EOI will be entitled to borrow an amount of the total funds available
determined on the basis of an equal allocation of such funds among all Companies, except that where such an allocation
would provide Companies funds in excess of their capital requirements, such excess will be available for loans allocated
among the other Companies. To the extent that EOI, ESI, and System Fuels are permitted to borrow through the Money Pool,
the funds available to EOI, ESI, and System Fuels will be allocated in the same manner. Companies that borrow will borrow
pro rata from Companies that lend in the proportion that the total amount loaned by the Companies that lend bears to
the total amount then loaned through the Money Pool.

Loans from and investments through the Money Pool will be evidenced on the books of Companies that borrow from or invest
in the Money Pool. Loans will be payable on demand, prepayable without premium, and will bear interest equal to the
Daily Weighted Average Investment Rate.
 However, if there are no excess Money Pool funds invested and thus no Weighted Average Investment Rate, then the loans
will bear interest equal to the Daily Federal Funds Effective Rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.




It is believed that the cost of loans through the Money Pool will be less than the cost of external loans through banks
and sales of commercial paper, and that the yield and terms available to Companies that invest in the Money Pool will
be better than the yields otherwise available to the Companies, because there is no spread added to the cost of funds
borrowed and because funds invested can be aggregated to command better terms.


The Utilities and SERI might establish lines of credit with various local commercial banks (``Local Banks'') and
with various non-local commercial banks (``Non-Local Banks'') on either an individual or a consolidated basis.
The Utilities and SERI also propose to issue and see unsecured short-term notes payable within one year. The Utilities
and SERI will select the interest rate for the notes from four options_(i) the prime commercial loan rate (``Prime
Rate'') from time to tome in effect; (ii) the sum of specified offered rates for bank certificates of deposit and a margin
not in excess of 2% per annum (``CD Rate''); (iii) the sum of specified rates offered for U.S. dollar deposits in the
inter-bank euro-dollar market and a margin not in excess of 2% per annum (``LIBOR Rate''); and (iv) a negotiated rate
not in excess of the Prime Rate (``Bid Rate''). The notes will, under certain circumstances and with the consent of
the banks, be prepayable without premium (except in the case of the CD Rate or LIBOR Rate).

The Utilities and SERI might agree to offer the banks a commitment fee not in excess of .025% per annum of the total unused
portion of the lines of credit, to maintain balances in accounts with the Local Banks to yield the equivalent of .025%,
or a combination of both.

The Utilities and SERI might also issue and sell commercial paper in the form of unsecured notes to mature within 270
days, not to be pre-payable, for a discount rate not in excess of the then-current maximum discount rate per annum.
No commission or fee will be paid by the Utilities or SERI. The commercial paper will be re-sold, for the then-current
discount rate, on a non-public basis to commercial banks, insurance companies, corporate pension funds, investment
trusts, foundations, colleges and university funds, municipal and state funds and other financial and non-financial
corporations that often invest funds in commercial paper.

Construction expenditures for the Utilities and SERI in 1994, 1995, and 1996 are estimated to be:






In addition, the Utilities and SERI will require capital funds during 1994-1996 to meet scheduled long-term
debt maturities and sinking fund requirements in amounts of $83 million for AP&L, $215 million for GSU, $162 million
for LP&L, $228 million for MP&L, $81 million for NOPSI, and $645 million for SERI.
Money Pool loans and receipts from notes to banks and commercial paper, with other funds available, will be used to
provide interim capital for construction expenditures, to meet long-term debt maturities and sinking-fund requirements
and to refund, redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire high-cost debt and preferred stock.
Loans through the Money Pool, pursuant to the ESI Loan Agreement, and under other external arrangements will be used
by ESI for lawful purposes in connection with its various functions. ESI expects to use a portion of the funds to finance
capital and other expenditures to be incurred through December 31, 1996, which include those in connection with a
new Corporate Training Center, telecommunications equipment, the renovation of Entergy Corporate Headquarters,
the acquisition of aircraft and the ESI pension plan. Loans through the Money Pool will be used by System Fuels for lawful
purposes in connection with its various functions, which include the acquisition and ownership of nuclear materials
and related services. Loans through the Money Pool, pursuant to the EOI Loan Agreement, and under other external arrangements
will be used by EOI to finance its interim capital needs. No proceeds to the Companies through the Money Pool, the issuance
and sale of notes, or the issuance and sale of commercial paper will be used to invest directly or indirectly in exempt
wholesale generators or foreign utility companies.
EOI and Entergy propose to enter into Amendment No. 3 to the EOI Loan Agreement (``Amendment No. 3'') to extend it through
November 30, 1996 and to provide for the issuance of a new note (``New EOI Note'') to mature on November 30, 1996. Amendment
No. 3 will state that the New EOI Note shall replace and supersede the EOI Note and represent the loans of EIO from Entergy
under the EOI Loan Agreement. The EOI Loan Agreement will continue in full force and effect under the terms of HCAR No.
25100.
In addition, ESI and Entergy propose to enter into Amendment No. 2 to the ESI Loan Agreement (``Amendment No. 2'') to
increase the commitment thereunder from $90 million to $150 million, extend its expiration date through November
30, 1996, and to provide for the issuance of a new note (``New ESI Note'') to mature on November 30, 1996. Amendment No.
2 will also state that the New ESI Note shall replace and supersede the ESI Note and represent the loans of ESI from Entergy
under the ESI Loan Agreement. The ESI Loan Agreement shall continue in full force and effect under the terms authorized
in HCAR No. 25376 and HCAR No. 25395.
The New EOI Note and the New ESI Note will be dated on or about the date of issuance of the order herein requested and be
stated to mature on November 30, 1996. The New EOI Note and the New ESI Note will continue to be payable to the order of
Entergy and will be prepayable without premium. The New EOI Note and the New ESI Note will bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount with interest based on the prime rate announced by Chemical Banking Corporation in New York, New
York from time to time.
Loans under the EOI Loan Agreement and the ESI Loan Agreement will be in addition to loans through the Money Pool. The
aggregate principal amount of loans to EOI pursuant to the EOI Loan Agreement, through the Money Pool, and through
other arrangements shall not exceed $15 million, subject to a prospective increase to $20 million pursuant to the
above-mentioned Commission reservation of jurisdiction. The aggregate principal amount of loans to ESI pursuant
to the ESI Loan Agreement, through the Money Pool, and through other arrangements shall not exceed $150 million. Finally,
the aggregate principal amount of loans to EOI and ESI through the Money Pool shall not credit then available to EOI
and ESI pursuant to the EIO Loan Agreement and the ESI Loan Agreement and other arrangements.

EOI and ESI also request authorization to extend the authorized period for external arrangements to borrow from one
or more banks through November 30, 1996 and, in the case of ESI, to increase the commitment thereunder from $90 million
to $150 million. Those external arrangements will reduce the amount Entergy has committed to EOI under the EOI Loan
Agreement and to ESI under the ESI Loan Agreement.
The proposed bank loans would be evidenced through unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $15 million
for EOI, subject to the above-mentioned increase to $20 million, and up to $150 million for ESI. The notes would be payable
by November 30, 1996 and would bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum selected by EOI
or ESI from the Prime Rate, the CD Rate, the LIBOR Rate or the Bid Rate. The notes will, under certain circumstances and
with the consent of the banks, be prepayable without premium (except in the case of the CD Rate or LIBOR Rate).


EOI or ESI might agree to offer the banks a commitment fee not in excess of 3/8 of 1% per annum of the total unused portion
of the lines of credit, to maintain balances in accounts with the Local Banks to yield the equivalent of 3/8 of 1%, or
a combination of both. Entergy might be required to guarantee the obligations of EOI and ESI to the banks. Authorization
for such guarantees through November 30, 1996 also is requested. Neither EOI nor ESI will borrow from banks until EOI
and Entergy, or ESI and Entergy, have filed a post-effective amendment with the names of the banks and the terms and
conditions of the loans.


New England Electric System (70-8453)



New England Electric System (``NEES''), 25 Research Drive Westborough, Massachusetts 01582, a registered holding
company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act.
NEES proposes to issue and sell short-term promissory notes to banks from time to time from November 1, 1994 to October
31, 1996 up to an aggregate principal amount of $100 million (``Notes'').

The Notes will mature in less than one year from the date of issuance. NEES will negotiate with banks the interest costs
of such borrowings. The effective interest cost of borrowings from a bank will not exceed the greater of the bank's
base or prime lending rate, or the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as the high federal funds rate, plus, in
either case, one percent. Certain of such borrowings may be without prepayment privileges. Based on the current base
lending rate of 7.25% and an equivalent or lower high federal funds rate, the effective interest costs of such borrowing
would not exceed 8.25% per annum.
Payment of the Notes prior to maturity will be made on the basis most favorable to NEES, taking into account fixed maturities,
interest rates, and any other relevant financial consideration.

ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is planning a public meeting to discuss the implementation of the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (International
Ship Management (ISM) Code). The ISM Code encourages the continuous improvement of safety management skills within
the maritime industry. In keeping with the results of a Coast Guard review of its regulatory development process,
the Coast Guard will hold a public meeting to provide the public an opportunity to comment and give input into the implementation
of the Code.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this Notice are LCDR Walter (Bud) Hunt, Project Manager, (202) 267-6230;
and Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Counsel; OPA 90 Staff.


Background and Discussion


On November 4, 1993, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted resolution A.741(18) entitled ``International
Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (International Safety Management (ISM)
Code).'' The objectives of the ISM Code are to improve safety at sea, to reduce the occurrence of human injury or loss
of life, and to minimize environmental and property damage attributable to marine casualties. The ISM Code seeks
to accomplish these objectives by encouraging the implementation of safety management systems (SMS) by shipping
companies with oversight by national administrations, such as the U.S. Coast Guard.
Beginning in 1998, the ISM Code will become mandatory for vessels to which the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention
applies. On July 1, 1998, the ISM Code will become mandatory for passenger ships, passenger high speed craft, oil tankers,
chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers, and cargo high speed craft of 500 gross tons and greater. On July 1,
2002, the ISM Code will become mandatory for other cargo ships and self propelled mobile offshore drilling units of
500 gross tons and greater. Until those dates, compliance with the ISM Code by owners of the various classes of vessels
is voluntary.
The ISM Code represents the culmination of an evolving recognition within the maritime industry that the ``human
element'' is a critical factor in preventing casualty or pollution incidents. Historically, the international
maritime community approached maritime safety from an engineering and technology perspective. International
standards addressed equipment and design requirements. However, despite these requirements, significant marine
casualties continue to occur. The ISM Code attempts to reduce these occurrences by recognizing that ``human factors,''
defined as acts or omissions of personnel which adversely affect the proper functioning of a particular system, or
the successful performance of a particular task, must be addressed in order to further reduce marine casualties and
pollution. The ISM Code acknowledges that the human element includes both vessel personnel, and the company management
infrastructure of the vessel's owner or operator. Decisions made ashore can be as important as those made at sea, and
therefore the ISM Code seeks to ensure that every action, taken at any level within a company, is based upon sound understanding
of the potential consequences on marine safety and pollution prevention. The IMO, in resolution A.647(16), cited
two key elements needed to realize the objectives of the ISM Code. Those elements include a philosophical commitment
to safety at the senior management level, and an effective organizational infrastructure to implement and monitor
a safety management program.
Under the ISM Code, a shipping company's Safety Management System (SMS) must include the following functional requirements:
(1) A safety and environmental protection policy; (2) instructions and procedures to ensure safe operation of ships
and protection of the environment in compliance with relevant international and flag state legislation; (3) defined
levels of authority and lines of communication between, and amongst, shore and shipboard personnel; (4) procedures
for reporting accidents and nonconformities with the provisions of the ISM Code; (5) procedures to prepare for and
respond to emergency situations; and (6) procedures for internal audits and management reviews.

The Coast Guard will promulgate implementing regulations when the ISM Code becomes mandatory. At present, U.S. certification
is voluntary. Authorized classification societies currently issues SMS certifications under the provisions of
Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2-94 (March 15, 1994). These certificates have neither
force nor effect under U.S. law. They indicate only that a company and its vessels comply with the terms of the ISM Code
as interpreted by NVIC 2-94, as determined by the authorized class society. Implementing regulations would
provide for Coast Guard examination of shipping companies and ships to which the ISM Code applies to determine their
compliance. The Coast Guard would authorize the issuance of certificates to companies and ships found to be in compliance.
Once the IIM Code comes into effect, port states around the world will check foreign flag vessels for compliance as
port calls are made. 

Companies which own or operate non-SOLAS vessels would be encouraged to voluntarily adopt practices which comply
with the provisions of the ISM Code. If such companies were determined to be in compliance, these companies and vessels
would be certified. 

The Coast Guard is interested in receiving comments on the potential costs and benefits of this implementation and
on the issues discussed in this notice. Specifically, the Coast Guard is interested in receiving comments on methods
by which the Coast Guard can ensure effective compliance with ISM Code standards, while minimizing the burden and
costs to the maritime industry. 

Implementation of the Code will entail a significant philosophical shift in the approach to safety at sea and environmental
protection. Because of this, the Coast Guard has decided to hold a public meeting in order to gather public and industry
input at early stages of the development of its implementing regulations.

Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed policy; extension of comment period and statement of intent to issue supplemental notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document announces an extension of the comment period on Notice of Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and
Charges, Docket No. 27782 (59 FR 29874, June 9, 1994) until October 15, 1994. By a notice published August 10, 1994,
the comment period on the Notice of Proposed Policy was extended until September 15, 1994 (59 FR 41194, August 10, 1994).
As a result of enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization act of 1994 (1994 Authorization Act),
the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA) have determined that the publication
of a supplemental notice of proposed policy may be in order. This notice is being published to advise interested persons
of the intention to publish a supplemental notice and to provide for an extension of the comment period to permit commenters
to review and respond to the supplemental notice in their comments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy
on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Notice 94-18,
a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' (Rules of Practice)
proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for
alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements
(59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994).




The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103-305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August
23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions providing new policy guidance on the reasonableness of
airport rates and charges and that direct the Secretary of Transportation to adopt guidelines, policies and procedures
for resolving air carrier/airport disputes over the reasonableness of landing fees. The 1994 Authorization Act
directs that such guidelines, policies and procedures be adopted within 90 days after enactment. The 90-day deadline
is November 21, 1994.

One air carrier has already suggested that the current notice of proposed policy should be withdrawn as inconsistent
with the 1994 Authorization Act. We do not agree that the 1994 Authorization Act requires so extensive a revision to
the notice of proposed policy. However, based on initial review of the new statutory provisions, some modifications
to the proposed policy may be in order to assure that the proposed policy conforms to the statute. Accordingly, the
OST and the FAA intend to publish a supplemental notice of proposed policy with the modifications we consider to be
appropriate.

Because the supplemental notice is not ready to publish at this time, we have concluded that an extension of the comment
period until October 15 is appropriate. This extension of the comment period should assure that interested persons
have an opportunity to review and address the supplemental notice in their comments and should not preclude the OST
and the FAA from meeting the statutory deadline for publication of final policy guidance.

In view of the statutory deadline, further extensions of the comment period are not anticipated. We intend to publish
the supplemental notice by October 1, 1994.

The FAA is simultaneously publishing a separate notice in the federal Register with respect to the proposed Rules
of Practice. The notice withdraws proposed subpart J, Alternate Procedure for Certain Complaints Concerning Airport
Rates and Charges and extends the comment period on the remainder of the proposal until December 1, 1994. In a separate
action, DOT intends to publish for comment proposed amendments to 14 CFR Part 302 to provide procedures for resolution
of airport/air carrier disputes over airport rates and charges by October 15, 1994. It is anticipated that the comment
period for the Part 302 proposal would not exceed 15 days.

<DOCTITLE>Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport, Minneapolis, MN; Approval of Noise Compatibility
Program</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On December 10, 1993, the FAA
determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by Metropolitan Airports Commission under Part 150 were in compliance
with applicable requirements. On June 8, 1994, the Assistant Administrator approved the Minneapolis-St Paul International
(Wold-Chamberlain) Airport noise compatibility program. Of the twenty two (22) noise abatement (NA) and land use
(LU) measurers included in the program, thirteen (13) were approved outright, six (6) were approved on a voluntary
basis, and the remaining three (3) were disapproved.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Minneapolis-St
Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport, effective June 8, 1994.


Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

(a) The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150.

(b) Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

(c) Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted
by the Federal Government; and

(d) Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150, section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Minneapolis-Airports District Office in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The Metropolitan Airports Commission submitted to the FAA on Marcy 30, 1992 the noise exposure maps, descriptions,
and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from November 1, 1990
through March 16, 1992. The Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport noise exposure maps
were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on December 10, 1993. Notice of this determination
was published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994.

The Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility
program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions
from the date of study completion through the year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material
as a noise compatibility program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on
December 10, 1993, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other
than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the
180 day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program.

The submitted program contained twenty two (22) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and/or off the Airport.
The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part
150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
effective June 8, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for thirteen (13) of the specific program elements, six (6) elements were approved
on a voluntary basis only, and the remaining three (3) were disapproved. The three disapproved elements consisted
of an extension of Runway 4/22, which was disapproved for purposes of the Part 150; a Standard instrument Procedure
(SID), which was disapproved due to safety and efficiency concerns; and a freeze on Stage 2 operations during the nighttime
hours, which was disapproved since the required Part 161 process had not been successfully completed. Additional
information is provided in the Noise Compatibility Plan and in the Record of Approval.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator on June
8, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal,
are available for review at the FAA office listed above, the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue
SW, Room 617, Washington, DC and at the administrative offices of the Metropolitan Airports Commission located at
6040 28th Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Questions on this FAA determination may be directed to the individual named above under the heading 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
