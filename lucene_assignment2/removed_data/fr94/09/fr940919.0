General Administrative Regulations; Actual Production History (APH) Coverage Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby issues regulations to provide a method for determining insurance
coverage based on Actual Production History (APH). An approved APH yield, when multiplied by a percentage of an elected
coverage level and price per commodity unit, results in a dollar amount of insurance coverage per acre. This rule is
being promulgated in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866, and Departmental Regulation
No. 1512-1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations
under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is September 1, 1999.



This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore, exempt
from OMB review and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

This action does not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. It imposes no added burden
on the insured farmer or on the private insurance company serving as the delivery agent. APH has been the basis for computing
insurance guarantees under the Federal Crop Insurance Program, on an 

ad hoc 

basis for over eight years and has its genesis in the Individual Yield Coverage Plan (7 CFR 400.15-400.21). This
rule codifies procedure which is already effective. Therefore, this action is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.

The program is listed in the Catalog of Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which require intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety.
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

The collection requirement for this regulation is form number FCI-19A (APH Production Reporting Form) and
has been previously approved by the OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq., 

the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The control number for the APH Production Reporting Form is OMB 

#

0563-0029. See 7 CFR part 400, subpart H.

It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this proposal does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The policies and procedures contained
in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule are not retroactive
and will preempt State and local laws to the extent such State and local laws are inconsistent. The administrative
appeal provisions, located at 7 CFR part 400, subpart J, must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought for
actions taken under these proceedings.



Background 



The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66),
requires the establishment of a plan and the publication of regulations for the use of the producer's actual production
history to determine yield coverage. FCIC has used such a plan on an 

ad hoc 

basis for a number of years.

An approved actual production history (APH) yield, multiplied by a percentage of an elected coverage level and price
per commodity unit, provides the dollar amount of insurance coverage per acre. If the insured does not submit production
records for insurance purposes, 65 percent of an FCIC estimated yield (transitional or determined yield) is the default
approved APH yield. The FCIC estimated yield, after applicable adjustment, is used in conjunction with actual production
records to compute the approved APH yield when less than four years of actual production records are available.

On October 14, 1993, the FCIC published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 53150 proposed regulations outlining the provisions for the APH plan. The FCIC requested and received comments
from the public regarding the proposal. 

The comments and their responses are grouped according to subject, area of concern, and by subpart of the proposed
regulation.



1. General Comments, Differences Compared to 1994 APH Program





Comments: 

Several comments pointed out that the new producer, crop year, and base period definitions differ from FCIC approved
procedures implemented for the 1994 crop year. The comments requested that the regulation be changed to agree with
those APH procedures if it is to be effective for the 1994 crop year. They indicated that these changes will drastically
affect computer programming, computer edits, FCIC data reporting requirements, etc. If the regulation is not changed
and is to be effective for the 1994 crop year, they requested that the comment period be reopened to provide an opportunity
to review the impact of these changes.



Response: 

There are differences between the regulation published for comment and the APH procedures used for the 1994 crop year.
The differences are minor but, if implemented for the 1994 crop year, the regulation would have major impacts on the
current program. Fall and spring seeded crop policies have been sold, production reports filed, and approved APH
yields calculated, processed, and submitted to FCIC based on procedures implemented in July 1993.

For these reasons, the regulation, with minor changes, will be implemented effective for the 1995 crop year.



2. Coverage and Participation





Comment: 

Twenty comments stated that the APH program will reduce insurance protection to many farmers, decrease farmer participation,
and increase future demand for free disaster payments. The comments suggested that FCIC encourage participation
by offering higher levels of protection to producers.



Comment: 

One comment noted that 65 percent of the transitional yield will be used when a producer does not furnish any previous
yield data. The comment suggested that FCIC change this percentage to 80 percent.

Comment:

 Section 400.54(b)_the proposed reduction of transitional or determined yields by the stated 80 percent for maintaining
one year of actual records and 90 percent for maintaining two years of actual records is inadequate to serve as an incentive
for insureds to report all four years of actual production in relationship to the 65 percent reduction for no records.
Also, there does not appear to be a penalty for maintaining only three years of actual records. A greater penalty is
needed for not maintaining less than four years of records.


Comment:

 One comment suggested that if a producer applying for Federal crop insurance coverage has no previous production
records (an example of this would be production of the alternative crop Kenaf, where very little production history
exists), that individual should be able to receive crop insurance coverage for the entire crop. The only way to accomplish
this is to raise the transfer yield to 100 percent, as opposed to 65 percent. The comment also recommended that an option
be provided to allow producers to purchase additional coverage for crops having no previous production records.


Comment:

 One comment urged FCIC to exclude those losses resulting from catastrophic events in the loss ratio determination.


Response:

 The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended, requires FCIC to take actions as necessary to improve actuarial soundness
of the multiple peril crop insurance program. FCIC is mandated to achieve an overall loss ratio, within certain parameters,
of not greater than 1.10 by October 1, 1995. FCIC's research using existing insureds' APH data indicates insureds
with no records of production (or one or two years of records) are paid disproportionate losses compared to insureds
who have provided three or more years of production records. Further analyses by FCIC using modified APH procedures
and existing insureds' APH data, indicates that 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield (hereafter referred
to as T-Yield in FCIC's responses) is an appropriate percentage to attain the required loss ratio for persons who have
not submitted records. Independent analyses from a private insurance association support these findings.
Insureds who have provided three or four years of records have lower loss costs and do not require the use of reduced
T-Yields. Modifications to APH are not intended to reduce insurance protection to farmers, rather the intent is to
base yields more fully on actual yields and to rely less on T-Yields. APH procedures allow ample opportunity for producers
who have not raised insurable crops (and therefore have not had the opportunity to establish records) to qualify for
APH yields greater than 65 percent of the T-Yield through use of new producer, added land, and new practice procedures.
Producers are encouraged to provide as many years of actual yields as possible. Above average yields will reduce the
impact of low yields. If actual yields reported are higher than the T-Yield, modified APH procedures allow a better
opportunity for increased insurance yields as compared to previous APH procedures.
FCIC is not able to provide APH yields higher than the insured's average yields without adversely affecting FCIC loss
ratio and financial accountability. FCIC has researched options that provide coverage based on yields higher than
the insured's APH yield or the yield history available for the crop on a county basis. This analysis indicates that
a significant increase in premium rates is required to make such a program actuarially sound. FCIC will retain the
APH structure as proposed.


3. Section 400.50 Availability of APH Program




Comment:

 The last sentence of  400.50 states, ``Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable
crop insurance contract for these crops apply.'' Concern was expressed that this regulation may override the terms
and conditions in current crop filings. The commentor indicated that policy language should not be superseded by
any other published regulations since policyholders receive copies of policy provisions but do not receive Federal
regulations.


Response:

 Federal regulations have the force and effect of law and all have constructive notice of the provisions. As a practical
matter we are not aware of any provision of the published policies in conflict with these regulations. As crop insurance
policies which base production guarantees on APH yields are revised, those provisions relating to APH will be changed
in accordance with the final APH regulation. Reinsured companies furnish policyholder's letters that describe
changes to each crop insurance contract. These letters also suggested that insureds contact their agents for a full
explanation of the changes and once so advised, insureds then can make informed crop insurance decisions. Copies
of these letters should be provided by the insurer to all affected policyholders.


4. Added Land (Purchased or Leased)




Comment:

 One comment stated concern that, under the proposed regulation, the producer is not eligible to transfer his or her
skill and history to new land purchased or leased. It was suggested that a producer's history be taken into account
when calculating coverage under a crop insurance policy.


Response:

 The regulation provides general rules while allowing flexibility for program details to be provided in procedures.
Added land procedures for APH yield determinations are available that provide insureds the opportunity to establish
approved APH yields higher than 65 percent of the T-Yield when new land is purchased or leased. FCIC has added a new paragraph
to  400.54(b) consistent with those procedures which allow yields for added land that are more comparable to
approved APH yields determined from acreage with records.

5. Databases Used To Calculate the APH Yield 





Comment: 

One comment noted that a four year history does not provide a balanced history in which an agent can accurately calculate
a producer's coverage. A one or two year drought would severely affect a producer's history. A ten year history would
provide more stability. 



Comment: 

One comment suggested that the base period be a minimum of five years. Four years are not sufficient. Approved yields
may fluctuate tremendously from year to year. The schedule for the percentage of the T-Yield used, based upon the years
records provided, should be as follows: zero years_80 percent; one year_85 percent; two years_90 percent; three
years_95 percent; four years_100 percent; and five or more years the T-Yield is not used. 



Comment: 

One comment noted that in  400.54(h), ``FCIC may use any production reports available under the provisions
of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not (emphasis added), which involve the interests of the insured
person in determining the approved APH yield.'' Current APH procedures allow new insureds (including insureds with
a break in continuity of insurance coverage of at least one year) to certify one or more crop years to establish the APH
yield. Since processing has already begun, implementation of yields that are not continuous will impose major difficulties.
In accordance with the proposed definition of crop year, this could require companies to maintain yield history indefinitely
(for example, a farmer may have had a policy five years ago with production history going back 30 or 40 years to accumulate
10 crop years). 



Response: 

The level at which the reduced T-Yield has been set for zero, one, or two years of records was established to offset disproportionate
losses as compared to insureds who have provided more years of actual records. Using higher levels of T-Yields is contrary
to that objective. The modified APH program encourages the insured to provide actual records by using reduced T-Yields
if the insured provides less than four years of actual yields. 

The proposed regulation does not limit insureds to providing only four years of actual yield. In fact, continuous
records up to ten years must be used if available. The more years of records used, the less the effect fewer actual yields
have. Insureds may submit one to ten years of continuous crop years of actual yields to be used in the APH yield calculation.


With data automation and reporting changes, actual yields will be retained until the database contains ten crop years
of actual yields. There is no need to expand the database to include calendar years that are not used to calculate the
APH yield. Data processing changes can be accomplished for the 1995 crop year. 



6. Why a Federal Regulation? 





Comment: 

One comment requested justification as to FCIC publishing in the 

Federal Register 

a program (APH) that has already been implemented by FCIC approved procedures. The comment went on to state that, as
introduced in the mid 1980's the APH program did not have its procedures published in the 

Federal Register. 

By implementing the program as a regulation, the comment stated that FCIC is limiting its ability to administer the
APH program as changes can no longer be handled administratively. Any changes will be required to be published in the


Federal Register 

prior to implementation. 



Response: 

The regulation provides a foundation on which the APH program and procedures will be based. The regulation will strengthen
FCIC's and reinsured companies' ability to defend the procedures used to determine APH yields if reconsideration,
appeal, or litigation proceedings relating to APH are pursued by insureds. The previous unpublished procedures
were not effective unless the insureds received actual notice of program changes prior to the contract change date.




7. Base Period Section 440.51(g) and Crop Year Section 400.51(i) 





Comment: 

 400.51(g), (i)_Three objections to the definition of crop year and base period were stated. The base period
is defined at 10 consecutive crop years. Crop year is defined as any year in which the crop is planted. Under the regulation,
the base period is no longer 10 consecutive crop years beginning with the most recent year, but would vary from each
crop and policy, and possibly from each database within a policy. It is conceivable that a database may contain land
planted to the insured crop every other year, in such case, the base period could stretch back 20 

calendar 

years to obtain 10 

crop

 years. 



Response: 

Crop year as defined, benefits producers who rotate different crops, rotate the same crop on different units, or who
only occasionally plant the insured crop. For example, if an insured has three consecutive crop years of actual records
on a unit: 1984, 1988, and 1993, by using crop year as defined in the regulation, all three actual yields will be retained
in the database for the 1995 crop year. If the crop is not planted in 1994, 100 percent of the T-Yield will be used as the
fourth yield when calculating the APH yield. The more years of experience in the database, the more reliable a yield
determination can be made. Requiring only 10 consecutive calendar years of records may result in a yield determination
which does not adequately reflect the farm history. 



Comment: 

A comment was received recommending deleting the last sentence of  400.51 (i) which states, ``If the insured
is prevented from planting all of his acreage in the county due to flood and does not plant for harvest any other crop,
FCIC will assign a yield for that year.'' 



Response: 

FCIC agrees with this comment and has deleted the last sentence accordingly. 



8. Section 400.51(m) New Producer Definition 





Comment: 

Several comments noted that the definition of new producer is different in the rule than the definition implemented
by the 

ad hoc 

procedures for 1994 fall crop year. The definition in the procedures defines a new producer as a ``person who has not
been actively engaged in farming for a share of the insured crop's production in the county for more than two years.''
The rule defines the new producer as ``a person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of a crop for more
than two years.'' The rule deals with individuals who are new to farming while procedures deal with individuals who
are new to producing the crop they wish to insure. If the proposed definition of a ``new producer'' goes into effect,
very few producers will qualify as a new producer. 



Response: 

FCIC agrees that this definition may be too restrictive. For example, a producer who has never raised corn would NOT
be considered a ``new producer'' for corn if he or she has raised another crop (wheat for example) for more than two crop
years. Under the proposed regulation this producer's insurance yield for corn would be restricted to 65 percent of
the T-Yield because records are not available for corn. A producer who has no farming experience at all would fare much
better, because as a ``new producer'' he or she will qualify for an insurance yield based on 100 percent of the T-Yield
(for all insured crops). After further evaluation, FCIC agrees that the ``new producer'' provisions should apply
to new producers of an insured crop regardless of their production of other crops. 



9. Section 400.51 Definitions





Comment: 

Several comments recommended technical corrections of definitions as follows: 

1. 

Actual Yield and Production Report

_reference is made to ``insurable acres for perennial crops'' instead of ``planted acres.'' 

2. 

Approved APH Yield_

the database may not always contain four consecutive crop years (actual yields). The definition needs clarity that
the total of the yields is divided by the 

number of years with yields. 

(Also see comments to definition of ``Crop Year.'') 

3. 

Assigned Yield

_suggest changing ``considered'' to ``handled in the same manner as.'' 

4. 

Master Yield

_indicate its availability is limited to certain crops and counties designated by FCIC. 

5. 

Production Report

_remove ``by us'' in the first sentence. Rewrite to include the possibility that production may be reported for more
than the one (most recent) crop year. 



Response: 

FCIC agrees with these comments and has revised the definitions accordingly.

10. Section 400.52 Reporting and Record Requirements





Comment: 

One comment suggested that the language in  400.52(b)(1), regarding inaccurate reporting or failure to retain
acceptable records, be changed from ``may result'' or ``may be'' to ``shall be'' to eliminate any implicit option.
The penalty for not having or retaining acceptable records should be the combining of farm units and the recalculation
of the APH yield.



Response: 

Basic farm units must be provided irrespective of APH records. Optional farm units are a further subdivision of basic
units and must meet separate record requirements stated in the crop policy to qualify as separate optional units.
Recalculation of the APH yield will not always result in a lower APH yield. However, if inaccurately reported or acceptable
records are not retained for either basic or optional units, APH yields will be recalculated. FCIC has made changes
to the regulation to address this concern that are consistent with the crop insurance policies.





Comment: 

Section 400.52(b)(4)_This provision states that the policy may be canceled and subject to false claims penalties
if the production history is not accurate. Section 400.52 (a)(3) indicates it is acceptable not to provide complete
production reports since assigned yields are an acceptable means to maintain continuity of yield data on file. A comment
suggested that  400.52 (a)(3) and (b)(4) are in conflict with  400.52(b)(1).



Response: 

FCIC does not agree that a conflict exists. However, FCIC has clarified these provisions to more accurately reflect
their intent. Section 400.52(a)(3) allows FCIC to use previously reported production history to calculate APH yields,
if the insured does not file annual production reports as required by the policy. Section 400.52(b)(1) specifies
that inaccurate reporting or failure to maintain acceptable supporting records will result in the combining of optional
units and recalculation of the APH yield. Section 400.52(b)(4) is a separate action that may be taken if an insured
misrepresents or fraudulently reports APH information.



11. Section 400.53 Submission and Accuracy of Production Reports





Comment: 

One comment suggested deleting  400.53(e) since it essentially duplicates the provisions of  400.53(a).



Response: 

FCIC agrees with this comment and has changed the provision accordingly.



12. Section 400.54 Qualification for Actual Production History Coverage Program





Comment: 

Section 400.54(a)_One comment suggested that the first sentence be revised because production reports for the four
most recent crop years are not required to qualify for APH. The comment also suggested revising the last sentence because
of the possibility of zero planted years. The comment suggested employing ``. . . will occur in the
database when there are less than four actual/assigned yields in the database.''



Response: 

FCIC agrees with these suggestions and has made the appropriate changes.



Comment: 

One comment noted that in  400.54(a) the term ``will be updated'' suggests that production reports are mandatory
each subsequent crop year. The comment suggested that the regulation address the possibility that coverage may be
based on 65 percent of the T/D yield without yearly production reports.

A comment also stated that records are not mandatory, as indicated in  400.54(b), and that insureds may have
approved APH yields based on 65 percent of the T/D-Yield if acceptable records are not available or not provided. The
comment also stated that yields from claims will not be used (as indicated in  400.51(n)), if an insured elects
not to provide records and have the APH yield based on 65 percent of the T/D Yield (also applies to  400.54(d)).



Response: 

FCIC implemented procedures for modified APH for the 1994 crop year intending to allow producers the option of basing
production guarantees on 65 percent of the T-Yield without requiring records. Not requiring records in subsequent
crop years had been criticized because the use of loss records is perceived to be mandatory for APH purposes. It is also
viewed as not encouraging insureds to provide records.

FCIC agrees that use of loss records should be required for APH purposes. Actual yields determined from claims for
indemnities will be used when calculating APH yields for the 1995 and succeeding crop years. Calculation of APH yields
based on 65 percent of the T-Yield without records will be allowed only for the initial crop year of insurance. Records
will be required for subsequent crop years.



Comment: 

Section 400.54(d)_One comment suggested deleting the phrase ``to compute an approved APH yield'' because it is not
required to have an actual yield for the most recent crop year to calculate an approved APH yield. The comment also suggested
deleting the phrase ``at discretion of FCIC.''



Response: 

FCIC does not agree with the suggestion to delete ``to compute an approved APH yield'' because the phrase relates to
providing actual yields (production records) in order to qualify for optional units. However, the language has been
clarified to reflect this intent.

FCIC does not agree that ``at discretion of FCIC'' should be removed. This provision allows FCIC a degree of flexibility
concerning the impact of loss records (e.g., FCIC may need to lessen the impact a loss record has on APH yields for a catastrophic
year).




Comment: 

Secion 400.54(e)_One comment suggested deleting provisions (1), (2), and (3), because the provisions are more applicable
to procedures. If not deleted, the comment suggested inclusion of the definition ``FCIC RSO Determined Yield'' and
clarification that provisions (1), (2), and (3) apply only to category C perennial crops, not just item (3). The comment
further suggested deleting any reference to T-yield tables in (1).



Response: 

FCIC does not agree that  400.54(e) (1), (2), and (3) of the rule should be deleted. These provisions allow additional
flexibility for those situations listed. For example, T-Yields are not published for all crops or for all counties.
Therefore, the rule must allow an alternative method to calculate approved APH yields when T-Yields are not available.
For this reason, the reference to T-Yields should not be deleted. These provisions allow FCIC to continue APH procedures
implemented for the 1994 crop year that are consistent with procedures used in previous crop years. The term ``FCIC
RSO Determined Yield'' is not used in the rule, so consequently, the term need not be defined.

Comment: 

Section 400.54(g)_One comment suggested the following rewrite of the last sentence to improve clarity: ``Master
Yields are based on production history from all acreage of the crop in which the insured has an interest in the county.''
Another comment noted that the rule consistently requires that the producer provide four years of records in order
to qualify for a Master Yield. This requirement has hampered new sales of crop insurance which use the Master Yield
concept. Master Yields may vary drastically between landlord and tenant on the same piece of ground due to the fact
that a producer's yield is calculated using records from all farms. The comment suggested that FCIC work with the industry
to resolve these problems. 



Response: 

FCIC agrees with these comments and has made the necessary changes. Regarding the concerns about Master Yields, FCIC
will not change the four-year record requirement because APH is also available on Master Yield crops. FCIC also will
base Master Yields on the operator's records. By calculating Master Yields from the operator's records, the same
APH yield will be provided for both the landlord and tenant. FCIC has implemented the Master Yield changes for the 1994
crop year. 



Comment: 

Section 400.54(h)_One comment suggested that the phrase ``whether continuous or not'' was misleading, considering
the previous emphasis on maintaining continuity of production reports. The comment further made the following observations.
If entering a yield is intended to allow use of history prior to the break in continuity of production reports, it should
be so clarified. If intended to allow prior history regardless of a break in continuity of insurance, entering a yield
will impose major difficulties. In conjunction with the revision in crop year definition, this could require companies
to maintain yield history indefinitely. For example, a farmer many have had a policy five years ago but production
history may have to go back 30 or 40 calendar years to accumulate 10 crop years of actual yields. 



Response: 

This provision does not affect the continuity requirements applicable to annual production reports provided by
the insured. However, it does allow FCIC to use production history on file prior to a break in continuity of insurance
coverage. FCIC reserves the latitude of implementing this provision by issuing procedures outlining records identification
(tracking) methods to correctly assign such production. FCIC recently implemented a policyholder tracking system
based on social security/employee identification numbers and may implement this provision in the future. Use of
this procedure keeps an insured who may have had a low APH yield from canceling insurance for one year in order to achieve
a fresh start, and thus, gain a higher yield.

The APH program operates within limits prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance
Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

), only on those crops identified in this section in those areas where the Actuarial Table provides coverage. Except
when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply.



 400.52 

Definitions.



In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance contract, the following definitions apply for the
purposes of the APH Coverage Program:

(a) 

APH

_Actual Production History.
(b) 

Actual yield_

The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield
is determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and appraised production) by planted acres
for annual crops or by insurable acres for perennial crops.

(c) 

Adjusted yield

_The transitional or determined yield reduced by the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield
will equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer records are submitted; 80 percent, if
records for one year are submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted.

(d) 

Appraised production

_Production determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company
reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal.
For the purpose of APH ``appraised production'' specifically excludes production lost due to uninsurable causes.

(e) 

Approved APH yield

_A yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by the
sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields divided by the number
of yields contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual and or assigned
yields. At least four yields will always exist in the database.

(f) 

Assigned yield

_A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports
as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in the same manner as actual yields when calculating
APH yields except for purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).

(g) 

Base period

_Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop
year defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is being established (except for sugarcane,
which begins the calendar year preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance contract).

(h) 

Continuous production reports

_Reports submitted by a producer for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the most recent crop
year in the base period.

(i) 

Crop year

_Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for APH purposes the term does not include any year when the crop
was not planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants
acreage in a county to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the policy definition. If the land is
summerfallowed the next calendar year, that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.

(j) 

Database

_A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield.

(k) 

Determined yield (D-yield)

_An estimated year for certain crops, which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop (attained
by using data available from The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage
established by the FCIC for each county.

(l) 

Master yields

_Approved APH yields, for certain crops and counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four
crop years of production records for a crop within a county.

(m) 

New producer

_A person who has not been actively engaged in farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than
two crop years.

<TEXT>
 

(n) 

Production report

_A written record showing the insured crop's annual production and used to determine the insured's yield for insurance
purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if applicable, including planted acreage for annual crops,
insurable acreage for perennial crops, and harvested and appraised production for the previous crop years. This
report must be supported by written verifiable records, measurement of farm stored production, or by other records
of production approved by FCIC on an individual basis. Information contained in a claim for indemnity is considered
a production report for the crop year for which the claim was filed.
(o) 

Production Reporting Date (PRD)

_The PRD is contained in the crop insurance contract and is the last date production reports will be accepted for inclusion
in the database for the current crop year.
(p) 

Transitional yield (T-Yield)

_An estimated yield, for certain crops, generally determined by multiplying the ASCS program yield by a percentage
determined by the FCIC for each county and provided on the actuarial table to be used in the APH yield calculation process
when less than four consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields are available.
(q) 

Verifiable records

_Contemporaneous records of acreage and production provided by the insured, which may be verified by FCIC through
an independent source, and which are used to substantiate the acreage and production that have been reported on the
production report.
(r) 

Verifier

_A person authorized by the FCIC to calculate approved APH yields.
(s) 

Yield variance tables

_Tables for certain crops that indicate unacceptable yield variations and yield trends which will require determination
of the APH yield by the FCIC.


 400.53

Yield certification and acceptability.


(a) Production reports must be provided to the crop insurance agent no later than the production reporting date for
the crop insured.
(1) Production reports must provide an accurate account of planted acreage for annual crops or insurable acres for
perennial crops, as well as harvested and appraised production by unit.
(2) The insured must certify the accuracy of the information.
(3) Production reported for more than one crop year must be continuous. A year in which no acreage was planted to the
crop on a unit or no acreage was planted to a practice, type, or variety requiring an APH yield will not be considered
a break in continuity. Assigned yields, at the discretion of the FCIC, may be used to maintain continuity of yield data
of file. Production on uninsured (for those years a crop insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is in
effect) or uninsurable acreage (for other years of the period) will not be used to determine APH yield unless production
from such acreage is commingled with production from insured or insurable acreage.

(b) Production reports and supporting records are subject to audit or review to verify the accuracy of the information
certified. Production and supporting records may be reviewed and verified if a claim for indemnity is submitted on
the insured crop. The reported yield is subject to revision, if needed, so that the claim conforms to the records submitted
at that time.
(1) Inaccurate production reports or failure to retain acceptable records shall result in the verifier combining
optional farm units and recomputing the approved APH yield. These actions shall be taken at any time after reporting
or record discrepancies are identified and may result in reduction of the approved APH yield for any calendar year.
(2) Records must be provided by the insured at the time of an audit, review, or as otherwise requested, to verify that
the acreage and production certified are accurate. Records of any other person having shares in the insured crop,
which are used by the insured to establish the approved APH yield, must also be provided upon request.
(3) In the event acreage or production data certified by two or more persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage is
different, the verifier shall, at the verifier's discretion, determine which acreage and production data, if any,
will be used to determine the approved APH yield. If the correct acreage and production cannot be determined, the data
submitted will be considered unacceptable by the verifier for APH purposes.
(4) Failure of the producer to report acreage and production completely and accurately may result in voidance of the
crop insurance contract, as well as criminal or civil false claims penalties pursuant to applicable Federal criminal
or civil statutes.


 400.54

Submission and accuracy of production reports.


(a) The insured is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete production
reports to the agent. Production reports must be provided for all planted units.
(b) Records may be requested by the FCIC, or an insurance company reinsured by the FCIC, or by anyone acting on behalf
of the FCIC or the insurance company. The insured must provide such records upon request.
(c) The agent will explain the APH Program to insureds and prospective insureds. When necessary, the agent will assist
the insured in preparation of production reports. The agent will determine the adjusted or unadjusted transitional
or determined yields in accordance with  400.54(b). The agent will review the production reports and forward
them to the verifier, along with any requested and required supporting records for determination of an approved APH
yield.
(d) The verifier will determine if the certified production reports are acceptable and calculate the approved APH
yield.


 400.55

Qualification for actual production history coverage program.


(a) The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing a minimum of four yields and will be updated each
subsequent crop year. The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop years and may include actual, assigned,
and adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields. T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur in the database when
there are less than four years of actual and/or assigned yields.
(b) The insured may be required to provide production records to determine the approved APH yield, if production records
for the most recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual production are provided, the records
must be continuous and contain at least the most recent crop year's actual yield.
(1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent
of T or D-Yield).
(2) If acceptable production records containing information for only the most recent crop year are provided, the
three T or D-Yields adjusted by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and calculate the approved
APH yield.
(3) If acceptable production records containing information for only the two most recent crop years are provided,
the two T or D-Yields adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to complete the database and calculate
the approved APH yield.
(4) If acceptable production records containing information for only the three most recent crop years are provided,
the three actual yields and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and calculate the approved
APH yield.
(5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple
average of the actual yields.

<TEXT>
 

(6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and
unadjusted T or D-Yields.

(7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to their farming operations and who do not have available
records for the added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields for the added land, practice,
types or varieties that are based on adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.


(8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting
average yield may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC guidelines. APH yields qualifying
for catastrophic yield adjustment may be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates for
approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may be based on the producer's APH average yield prior
to the catastrophic adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.


(c) If 

no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted 

for a year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain the continuity of production reports
for APH record purposes and that calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.

(d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be entered in the database. The resulting average yield
will be used to determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of FCIC.




(e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not provide acceptable production reports for at least
the most recent crop year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.




(f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in the following situations:

(1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,





(2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance tables, and 

(3) For perennial crops:

(i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;

(ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the production level;

(iii) if more than two percent of the trees or vines have been removed within the last two years; or

(iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average yield are requested by the insured.



(g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC
has been performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in accordance with the crop insurance contract.

(h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation requirements and land leasing practices limit the
yield history available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master Yields are available. To qualify,
the producer must have at least four recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify the
authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master Yields are based on acreage and production history
from all acreage of the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the crop's production.

(i) FCIC may use any production report available under the provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous
or not, involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the approved APH yield.



 400.56

Administrative appeal exhaustion.



The insured may appeal the approved APH yield in accordance with the procedures contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart
J. Administrative remedies through the appeal process must be exhausted prior to any action for judicial review.
The approved APH yield determined as a result of the appeal process will be the yield applicable to the crop year.






 400.57

OMB control numbers.





OMB control numbers are contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart H.

Marketing and Selling Real Property on an Individual Basis and Disposition of Real Estate-Related Assets



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Resolution Trust Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is hereby adopting an interim rule with request for comments to implement
the marketing provisions contained in subsections (w)(2) and (3) of section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBA),
recently added by section 3(a) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act. This rule provides policies and
procedures required under subsections (w)(2) and (3) for the marketing of real estate owned (REO) assets on an individual
basis and for the disposition of REO assets with a book value of more than $400,000 and non-performing real estate loans
with a book value of more than $1 million.




This rule supersedes the marketing policy for real estate owned, entitled ``Individual REO Sales,'' adopted by the
RTC on April 15, 1993.

The RTC is seeking comments on all aspects of the interim rule.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background



In August 1989, Congress enacted section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act
of 1989, (FIRREA), adding section 21A to the FHLBA (12 U.S.C. 1441a), and establishing the RTC. Pursuant to section
21A(b) of the FHLBA, the RTC has the duty to manage and resolve failed savings associations for which it is appointed
conservator or receiver and to conduct its operations in a manner which maximizes the return from the sale of institutions
or their assets, makes efficient use of funds, and minimizes losses in the resolution of institutions. In addition,
the RTC is required to resolve all failed thrifts by the ``least costly'' method. See section 13(c)(4) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)), applicable to the RTC pursuant to section 21A(b)(4) of the FHLBA
(12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4)).



The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act



The RTC Completion Act was signed by the President and took effect on December 17, 1993 (Pub. L. 103-204). Section
3(a) of the RTC Completion Act amended section 21A of the FHLBA by adding subsection (w), a list of 21 managment reforms
for the RTC. Implementation of two of these reforms is the subject of this interim rule.



Subsection (w)(2)_Individual Marketing Period



Subsection (w)(2) of section 21A of the FHLBA requires the RTC to market real property on an individual basis for at
least 120 days before making the property available on a portfolio basis or in a multi-asset sales initiative. Subsection
(w)(2), unlike subsection (w)(3) discussed below, applies only to REO and not to loans or any other types of assets.
This provision applies to REO in which a thrift under the RTC's jurisdiction holds, directly or indirectly, an undivided
or controlling interest. By including property held indirectly by a thrift, this provision applies to subsidiary
property as well.

The provision excepts real property transferred in connection with a resolution in which the acquirer purchases
a significant portion of a failed institution's assets and assumes either a significant portion of the failed institution's
liabilities or acts as agent for the RTC in paying the claims of insured depositors. In other words, this exception
is designed to extend not only to the standard purchase and assumption transaction, but also to an insured deposit
transfer where the acquiring institution does not actually assume the deposit liabilities. Another exception exempts
the transfer of real property by the original pass-through receiver to a de novo institution organized by the RTC pursuant
to section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the FHLBA.

Subsection (w)(2) requires the RTC to promulgate: (1) Regulations which require the RTC to justify in writing the
sale of any real property asset on a portfolio basis or in a multi-asset initiative after the 120-day individual marketing
period, and (2) regulations to carry out other requirements of the individual marketing provision.



Subsection (w)(3)_Marketing Procedures for Certain Assets



With respect to non-performing real estate loans with a book value of more than $1 million and real property with a book
value of more than $400,000, subsection (w)(3) establishes several marketing procedures for the RTC. Subsection
(w)(3)(A) prohibits the RTC from selling such assets unless:

(1) the RTC has assigned the management and disposition of such asset to a qualified person or entity to:

(a) analyze each asset and consider alternative disposition strategies;

(b) develop a written management and disposition plan; and

(c) implement that plan for a reasonable period of time; or

(2) the RTC determines in writing that a bulk transfer of the asset would maximize the net recovery, while providing
opportunity for broad participation by qualified bidders, including minority- and women-owned businesses.

Subsection (w)(3) permits the RTC to define ``asset'' to include properties or loans which, although legally discrete,
have sufficiently common characteristics that they may logically be treated as a single asset. Such a definition
permits the RTC to provide a single asset management and disposition plan for several assets. The statute also expressly
allows the RTC to define ``qualified person'' to include employees assigned to the RTC and Thrift Depositor Protection
Oversight Board (TDPOB) employees. Implementation of these definitions requires the RTC to promulgate regulations.

In addition to the exceptions created by the $400,000 and $1 million thresholds for real estate and non-performing
real estate loans, respectively, subsection (w)(3) establishes two exceptions to the requirements of subsection
(w)(3)(A). First, as under subsection (w)(2), subsection (w)(3)(C) exempts assets transferred in connection with
a standard purchase and assumption agreement or an insured deposit transfer agreement where a significant portion
of the failed institution's assets are transferred, as well as assets transferred to a de novo institution organized
by the RTC under section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the FHLBA. Second, subsection, (w)(3)(C)
permits the RTC to dispose of assets with book values above the threshold, without complying with the requirements
of (w)(3)(A), whenever the RTC determines, in writing, that such a disposition will bring a greater return.



Relationship to the Small Investor Program



Congress considered the needs of smaller investors in framing the provisions contained in sections 21A(w) (2) and
(3) of the FHLBA. The needs of small investors were addressed by a) an emphasis on individual marketing and sales of
significant assets, and b) the structuring of bulk transactions in a fashion which increases the participation by
bidders with moderate levels of capital.

<TEXT>
 

These new statutory provisions in many ways reflect the programs begun by the RTC in the spring of 1993 to enhance opportunities
for individual and small investors. On April 13, 1993, the RTC announced the establishment of the Small Investor Program
on an interim basis to ensure that RTC's assets are available for sale individually to small investors with moderate
levels of capital. By memorandum dated April 15, 1993, entitled ``Individual REO Sales,'' the RTC adopted a marketing
policy for REO similar to the procedure outlined in section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA. That policy required the active
marketing of most REO for 120 days prior to its inclusion in any multi-asset sales initiative. The procedures adopted
in this interim rule replace the previous policy. 

Small Investor Program Offices have been established in the RTC's Washington, D.C. headquarters and in each of the
RTC's six Field Offices with staff dedicated to addressing the needs of small investors. The Small Investor Program
targets individual investors and small investor groups, including Minority and Women-Owned Businesses (MWOB)
with the capacity to purchase: (i) REO assets and portfolios valued up to $5 million, (ii) loan pools up to $10 million,
(iii) subsidiaries valued from $5 thousand to $30 million, and (iv) equity investments from $4 million to $9 million
in joint venture transactions. 

The Small Investor Program was instrumental in the implementation of two ``Equity Partnership'' Programs designed
to increase opportunities for the small investor: the Judgments, Deficiencies, and Charge-Offs (JDCs) Program
and the ``S-Series'' Program. These loan disposition initiatives have encouraged greater participation from small
investors by reducing asset pool sizes and lowering equity requirements and other fees. 

The RTC frequently conducts non-performing loan auctions to achieve broad market exposure and obtain the best price
through the competitive bidding process. However, the average size of portfolios has been decreased and are more
geographically limited to allow small investors a greater opportunity to compete for these assets. In addition,
the overall required bidding deposit has been reduced from $100,000 to $50,000 to increase the participation of small
investors. 

Loan portfolio offerings available through the Small Investor Program have become smaller, more geographically
segmented, and the pools of assets are structured by specific asset type to appeal to small investors. For each loan
offering, a comprehensive and specifically targeted marketing campaign is implemented to promote the offering
and attract a sufficient number of potential purchasers to the sale. 

Localized real estate auctions are held more frequently and are more geographically focused to increase opportunities
for small investors to purchase assets. 

Sealed Bid offerings are available through the Small Investor Program which allow investors to value independently
an individual asset or package of assets and submit a confidential bid along with other interested parties. Comprehensive
sales brochures are available which provide detailed property and bidding information. 

Seminars are conducted frequently to inform potential small investors of the goals of the Small Investor Program
and the opportunities available to purchase assets of the Resolution Trust Corporation.

Initiatives such as these fulfill the new legislation's goal of providing opportunities to a broad range of qualified
bidders and will be continued throughout the remaining life of the RTC. In addition, these initiatives undertaken
by the Small Investor Program are consistent with the original duties mandated by section 21A(b)(3) of the FHLBA,
(i.e., to dispose of assets from failed savings associations, obtain the maximum value for those assets, and minimize
the cost of resolutions to taxpayers.)



Description and Explanation of the Interim Rule



Subpart A_Marketing and Selling Real Property on an Individual Basis for 120 Days



Section 1640.1 describes the purposes and scope of Subpart A of the interim rule, implementing section 21A(w)(2)
of the FHLBA.

This Subpart requires the RTC to comply with new individual marketing and sales requirements for real property assets
held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993, unless they were the subject of a contract to sell or other disposition
contract on that date. The RTC is relying on the effective date of the RTC Completion Act to determine the property affected
by this new provision; nothing in the legislation suggests that such contracts should be abrogated.

Section 1640.2 contains the definitions of significant terms used in this Subpart. Consistent with the requirement
that the RTC has an undivided or controlling interest in the asset subject to this provision, the definition of ``real
property'' expressly excludes a time share interest, a space lease, or a security interest in property, including
a mortgage or deed of trust.

<TEXT>
 

When read together, subsections (w)(2) and (w)(3) of section 21A of the FHLBA indicate that Congress intended the
concept of a single asset to include two or more legally discrete assets which are so interconnected as to constitute
a single economic unit. On that basis, the RTC has defined ``single real property asset'' to allow for the inclusion
of more than one asset in which the RTC holds an undivided or controlling interest, if such assets may logically be treated
as a common asset because they have at least two common characteristics. Some examples of such characteristics are
contiguity, economic integration, shared utility systems, former common ownership or operation, common infrastructure
improvements, and common recreational facilities.


Subsection (c) of section 1640.2 defines the term ``market'' as providing notice to the public of the availability
of the property for sale. This definition encompasses a variety of marketing techniques, thereby permitting the
RTC the discretion to choose the technique which best suits a particular asset. Marketing of an asset involves exposure
to a target market through a variety of methods. These methods may include, without limitation, advertising in local,
regional or national newspapers or other publications, advertising in trade journals for specialized properties
such as hotels, distributing of professional marketing materials, or listing of the property with a broker or other
contractor with the expertise to expose the property extensively in its target market.


Section 1640.3(a) of the interim rule requires the RTC to market and sell real property assets solely on an individual
basis for 120 days or until an asset is sold under subsection (b) of the same section. During the initial 120-day marketing
period, however, the RTC may promote the sale of more than a single real property asset in a single promotional medium.
In addition, during that marketing period, that the RTC may sell or otherwise dispose of, a single real property asset
in an open or sealed-bid auction, or other multi-asset marketing program, so long as bids are received and accepted
only for individual properties.


Section 1640.4 provides that upon the expiration of the 120-day period, any single real property asset which remains
unsold may be disposed of in connection with a portfolio sale or a multi-asset sales initiative under section 1640.4,
only if the RTC determines in writing that such a disposition would likely maximize the net recovery to the RTC. As used
in this rule, a portfolio sale or multi-asset sales initiative refers to the method of asset disposition of two or more
assets (without sufficiently common characteristics to be treated as a single asset) where the RTC permits the sale
of two or more assets for one indivisible price.


Section 1640.5 sets forth the exceptions to the individual marketing and sales requirement. The provisions of section
21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA, as implemented by the interim rule, do not apply to real property transferred as part of so-called
``purchase-and-assumption'' agreements, i.e., where assets are sold simultaneously with a resolution in which
a buyer (i.e., an acquiring financial institution) purchases a significant proportion of the assets and either assumes
a significant proportion of the liabilities or acts as agent of the RTC for purposes of paying insured deposits. The
RTC has interpreted this exemption to apply to any single real property asset for which the RTC has granted the acquiring
financial institution an option to purchase the asset, although, if the option expires and the asset remains the property
of the RTC, then section 21A(w)(2) of the FHLBA and these implementing regulations would then apply to the property.
Also exempted from the individual marketing and sales requirement are single real property assets which are transferred
to de novo institutions, organized by the RTC pursuant to section 11(d)(2)(F) of the FDIA or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv)
of the FHLBA.




Subpart B_Disposition of Real Estate-Related Assets




Section 1640.11 of the interim rule describes the purpose and scope of this Subpart, i.e., to establish the methods
by which the RTC intends to comply with the disposition provisions of section 21A(w)(3) of the FHLBA applicable to
real estate-related assets held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993, which are not subject to a contract to sell
or other disposition contract as of that date. Subsection (c) of section 1640.11 recognizes that the RTC may have taken
actions, prior to the effective date of this Subpart, to satisfy the new statutory requirements, which should be used
to determine the RTC's compliance with those requirements.


The requirements of Subpart B apply only to a single real property asset or non-performing single real estate-related
loan, which are considered ``real estate-related assets'' for these purposes. Under section 1640.12, the RTC defines
relevant terms for purposes of Subpart B, such as real property, single real property asset, real estate-related
asset, and non-performing single real estate-related loan. A ``single real property asset'' is defined as a real
property asset with a book value of more than $400,000 as determined by the RTC, in which the RTC has an undivided or controlling
interest. As under Subpart A, two or more separate real property assets, each with a value of more than $4,000, may be
logically treated as a single real property asset if they have at least two common characteristics, as described above.
A ``non-performing single real estate-related loan'' is a loan or group of loans with sufficiently common characteristics,
each with a book value of more than $1 million as determined by the RTC, in which the RTC holds an undivided or controlling
interest, secured by real property, which is more than 90 days delinquent.

The definition of ``non-performing single real estate-related loan'' includes a participation loan whenever the
RTC in fact controls the management and disposition of that loan, and the book value of the entire loan, not just the
RTC's share, is greater than $1 million. However, the definition does not include a participation loan which the RTC
does not control, no matter how large the RTC`s ownership interest is in the loan.



Section 1640.13 requires the RTC to assign the responsibility for the management and disposition of a real estate-related
asset to a qualified person or entity prior to disposition of the asset, unless the RTC makes a written determination
that a bulk sale would likely maximize net recovery to the RTC and provide broad participation by qualified bidders,
including minority- and women-owned businesses. Under section 1640.12, a ``qualified person or entity'' for a real
estate-related asset is defined as an employee of the RTC or the TDPOB or an asset management contractor of the RTC who
meets the minimum qualifications established by the RTC for managing and analyzing assets of the same type. The qualified
person or entity assigned to the property must analyze each individual asset, consider alternative disposition
strategies, recommend a disposition strategy to maximize net recovery to the RTC, develop a written management and
disposition plan, and implement that plan for a reasonable period of time.

Alternative disposition strategies for REO may include, at a minimum, sale on an individual basis via broker and sale
on an individual basis via auction or sealed bid. For non-performing real estate loans, disposition strategies usually
include modification, foreclosure or other legal action, compromise and settlement, and individual sale via auction
or sealed bid.
Like Subpart A, Subpart B does not apply to real estate-related assets sold simultaneously with a purchase-and-assumption
agreement (including option agreements during the duration of the option) or transferred by the RTC to a de novo institution
(discussed more fully above under Subpart A). Subpart B, by its terms, does not apply to individual real estate assets
with a book value of $400,000 or less or individual non-performing real estate loans with a book value of $1 million
or less. In addition, Subpart B does not apply to assets meeting these thresholds, if the RTC determines that a disposition
not in conformity with Subpart B and section 21A(w)(3) of the FHLBA would bring a greater return.
Finally, subsection (w)(3)(D) provides that no provision in (w)(3) shall supersede the requirements of subsection
(w)(2). Section 1640.15 reiterates this principle of implementation by providing that nothing contained in Subpart
B supersedes the requirements of (w)(2) or Subpart A. Consequently, all real property with a book value of more than
$400,000 must be marketed on an individual basis for a minimum of 120 days in conformity with subsection (w)(2) and
Subpart A of these regulations.


Administrative Procedure Act


The RTC is adopting this rule as an interim rule. It will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register
without the usual notice and comment period or delayed effective date generally provided for in the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. For the most part, this rule implements the express language of section 21A(w) (2) and
(3) of the FHLBA, as recently added by the RTC Completion Act. Promulgation of the rule on an expedited basis is necessary
to permit the immediate implementation of these new provisions in order to avoid any additional losses that could
occur due to a delay in the sales of assets in connection with the resolution of failed thrifts pending the usual delayed
effective date. Thus, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting the interim rule outweigh any possible
harm resulting from not seeking comment on the proposed rule in advance of its effective date. The RTC actively solicits
comments on this interim rule and will consider those comments in the adoption of the rule as final.


Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility
analysis is provided:
1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim rule. These elements have been discussed above in
the Supplementary Information section.
2. Small entities to which the rule would apply. This rule applies only to procedures for the RTC's marketing and disposition
of certain types of assets.
3. Impact of the interim rule on small businesses. This rule imposes no burden on small businesses. Rather, as part
of the RTC's Small Investor Program, it is intended to offer small businesses greater opportunities to acquire certain
types of assets from the RTC.
4. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules that overlap, duplicate, or conflict
with the interim rule.
5. Alternatives to the interim rule. The RTC has not identified alternatives that would be less burdensome to small
businesses and yet effectively accomplish the objectives of the interim rule because it imposes no burden on small
businesses.


Request for Public Comment


The RTC is issuing this interim rule to implement immediately statutory direction to market and sell real property
on an individual basis for 120 days and to provide procedures favoring the individual management and disposition
of larger real estate-related assets, unless a bulk transaction would likely maximize the net recovery to the RTC.
Nonetheless, the RTC is hereby requesting comment on all aspects of this interim rule during a 30-day comment period.

the RTC to justify in writing the disposition of real property assets on a portfolio basis or as part of a multi-asset
sales initiative.
(b) This subpart applies with respect to all single real property assets held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993;
provided, however, that this subpart shall not apply with respect to any such assets which were the subject of a contract
to sell or other disposition contract on December 17, 1993.


 1640.2 

Definitions.

including contiguity, economic integration, shared utility systems, former common ownership, former common operation,
common infrastructure improvements, common recreational facilities and other similar characteristics;
(i) 

Undivided interest,

 with respect to a single real property asset, shall mean an interest which gives the RTC complete ownership and control
of the disposition of such asset; and
(j)

 1640.3 

Procedure during initial 120-day marketing period. 



(a) 

Marketing. 

(1) The RTC shall market a single real property asset on an individual basis for 120 days or until such asset is sold in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section during the initial 120-day marketing period. Provided, however, nothing
contained in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the RTC from promoting the sale on an individual basis,
in accordance with paragraph (b), of this section, of more than one single real property asset in the same marketing
materials. 

(2) Any actions, which otherwise satisfy the standards of this subpart, undertaken by the RTC to market a single real
property asset prior to September 19, 1994 shall be used to determine compliance with this subpart. 

(b) 

Disposition. 

During the initial 120-day marketing period for a single real property asset, the RTC shall only sell or otherwise
dispose of, such asset solely on an individual basis, and the RTC shall not dispose of such asset in connection with
a portfolio sale or a multi-asset sales initiative. Provided, however, nothing contained in this paragraph shall
be construed to prohibit the RTC from selling, or otherwise disposing of, a single real property asset during such
period in an open or sealed-bid auction, or other multi-asset marketing program, in which bids are received and accepted
only on an individual basis. 



 1640.4 

Procedure after initial 120-day marketing period. 



With respect to a single real property asset which remains unsold after the initial 120-day marketing period for such
asset, the RTC may only dispose of such asset in connection with a portfolio sale or a multi-asset sales initiative
if the RTC determines in writing that such disposition of the asset would maximize the net recovery to the RTC. 



 1640.5 

Exceptions. 



The provisions of this subpart and section 21A(w)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act shall not apply: 

(a) To single real property assets which are sold simultaneously with a resolution in which a buyer purchases a significant
proportion of the assets and either assumes a significant proportion of the liabilities or acts as agent of the RTC
for purposes of paying insured deposits of an institution described in section 21A(b)(3)(A) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act. (This exemption applies to any single real property asset for which the RTC has granted the buyer an option
to purchase; provided, however, if at the expiration of such option the asset remains the property of the RTC, then
the provisions of this subpart and section 21A(w)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act shall then apply to such asset.);
or 

(b) To single real property assets which are transferred by the RTC to a new insured depository institution organized
by the RTC pursuant to section 11(d)(2)(F) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 21A(b)(10)(A)(iv) of the

establishes requirements regarding the disposition of real property with a book value of more than $400,000 and non-performing
real estate-related loans with a book value of more than $1,000,000. 

(b) This subpart applies with respect to all real estate-related assets held by the RTC on or after December 17, 1993;
provided, however, this subpart shall not apply with respect to any such assets which were the subject of a contract
to sell or other disposition contract on December 17, 1993. 

(c) Any actions of the RTC, which otherwise satisfy the standards of section 21A(w)(3) of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Act and this subpart, undertaken prior to September 19, 1994 shall be used to determine compliance with section 21A(w)(3)
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act and this subpart. 



 1640.12 

Definitions. 



For purposes of this subpart and section 21A(w)(3) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, the following definitions apply:



(a) 

Bulk transaction

Airworthiness Directives; Cessna Aircraft Company Models 421C and 425 Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment revises Airworthiness Directive (AD) 91-25-08, which currently requires repetitively
inspecting both wing front spar upper caps for cracks on certain Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna) Models 421C and
425 airplanes, and repairing cracks that exceed certain limits. This action provides the option of incorporating
a certain wing spar upper cap service kit as either terminating action or as an extension to the repetitive inspections
currently required. Wing front spar upper cap cracks at the main landing gear actuating cylinder attachment fitting
on three of the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent wing
failure caused by excessive wing spar cracking.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
Cessna Models 421C and 425 airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 20, 1994 (59 FR 18768). The action proposed to revise AD 91-25-08 by maintaining the wing front
spar upper cap repetitive inspection and possible crack repair requirement, and adding the option of incorporating
the applicable Cessna service kits to either eliminate or extend the inspection time interval (depending on whether
cracks are found) of the repetitive inspections. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with
the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of ATTACHMENT TO SERVICE BULLETIN (SB) to Cessna SB CQB91-8R1, or
the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS attachment to Cessna SB MEB91-7R1, as applicable. The proposed inspection-extending
or inspection-terminating modifications (optional) would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions
to the applicable service kits that are included as an attachment to the above-referenced service bulletins. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
The commenter states that, although the proposal does not apply to the serial number airplanes that the commenter
owns, all 16 hi-lock pins of each aft main landing gear support (part number 5122724-1 and 5122724-2) were
found loose during an annual inspection. The commenter believes that the above-referenced main landing gear supports
are located in the same general area as the area referenced in the proposal, and that these areas share the same structural
loads. For these reasons, the commenter proposes expanding the rule to include an inspection of these main landing
gear supports as well as the wing front spar upper caps. The FAA concurs that the referenced main landing gear supports
are in the same general area as the wing front spar upper caps (between the main landing gear actuating cylinder attachment
and the front spar wing attach fittings); however, the two do not share the same structural loads. The main landing
gear supports incur loads from the landing gear while the upper spar caps incur loads from the gear retraction cylinder.
This AD is written only to detect and correct wing front spar upper cap cracking because the FAA identified this as an
unsafe condition that needed AD corrective action. The FAA will evaluate service difficulty reports on the main landing
gear supports, and, if found necessary, will initiate applicable rulemaking at that time. The AD is unchanged as a
result of this comment.

After careful review of all available information including the comment referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections.
The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden
upon the public than was already proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 551 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
3 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $90,915. This figure
does not take into account the cost of repetitive inspections nor the cost of the optional inspection-extending or
inspection-terminating service kit installations. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections
each operator would incur over the lifetime of the airplane. 

In addition, the FAA estimates 52 workhours to install service kits on the spar caps at an average labor rate of approximately
$55 an hour, and $1,050 cost per airplane for service kit parts. Based on these figures, the cost for the optional service
kit installations on U.S. operators would be $2,154,410 or $3,910 per airplane. After incorporation of these kits,
the repetitive inspections would be terminated or the number of repetitive inspections would be reduced depending
on whether the spar was cracked. 

The Cessna Aircraft Company has informed the FAA that 67 SK421-142  (-1 or -2) or SK425-44
(-1 or -2) service kits have been sold, thus reducing or terminating the inspections for the particular
airplane wing front spar upper cap that the kit is installed on. Repetitive inspections are no longer required on the
airplane if both wing front spar upper caps have service kits incorporated, and these kits are incorporated without
cracks present. The FAA has no reasonably available means of finding out how many inspection reductions (kit incorporated
with cracks) and how many inspection terminations (kit incorporated without cracks) are involved, or how many airplanes
incorporated a left wing kit  (-1) and a right wing kit (-2). With this in mind, the FAA does not know
exactly how much this reduces the cost of the inspections and optional modification portion of this AD on U.S. operators;
however, the FAA would estimate this cost reduction at around $125,000, thus reducing the optional modification
portion of this AD from a fleetwide cost impact of $2,154,410 to $2,029,410. This estimate is based on taking the average
workhour per wing of 26 workhours (2 wings = 52 workhours) times the average labor rate of $55 per hour plus the average
cost of the different kits. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

Transfer of the International Space Station From the USML to the CCL (ECCN 9A04A) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which identifies those items
subject to Department of Commerce export controls. This final rule amends Export Control Classification Number
(ECCN) 9A04A to include the international space station and all components, parts, accessories, attachments and
associated equipment specially designed, modified or configured therefor. The international space station is
being built under the supervision of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NASA's international
partners: the space agencies of Japan, Canada and Russia, and the European Space Agency. The Department of State will
publish a separate rule that removes the space station from the United States Munitions List (USML).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On November 16, 1990, President Bush signed Executive Order 12735 on Chemical and Biological Weapons and directed
various other export control measures. The measures directed by the President included the removal from the USML
(see 22 CFR part 121) of all items contained on the COCOM dual-use list (i.e, the International Industrial List), unless
U.S. national security interests would be jeopardized. To implement this part of the directive, the Space Technical
Working Group (STWG), was established. The group consists of representatives from the Departments of State, Commerce,
and Defense, as well as other U.S. Government agencies. The STWG recommended movement of certain non-military spacecraft,
including the international space station, from the USML to the CCL. Further, on March 10, 1994, an interagency Space
Station Export Controls Steering Committee recommended several steps in the area of U.S. export controls that are
necessary for NASA to advance its international space station program; one of those steps involved the movement of
the international space station itself from export control under the USML to control under the CCL, as well as all components,
parts, accessories, attachments and associated equipment specially designed, modified or configured for the international
space station. 

In addition to the removal of international space station commodities from the USML, the State Department is removing
from the USML certain software and technology related to the international space station, which software and technology
are not captured under Category XV(f) of the USML. Such software and technology not captured under Category XV(f)
of the USML are currently captured on the CCL at ECCNs 9D96G and 9E96G and will remain under those ECCNs. 

Although the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA, as amended,
shall be carried out under Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, so as to continue in full force and effect and amend,
as necessary, the export control system heretofore maintained by the Export Administration Regulations issued
under the EAA. 

 


Rulemaking Requirements 


1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of 
E.O. 12866. 
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005,
0694-0010, 0694-0013, and 0694-0073. 
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 

 
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a))
no 
initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the
effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves 
a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed

rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 

Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Hillary Hess, Office of Technology

and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

Amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)



<AGENCY>

Department of State.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This final rule amends the regulations implementing section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, which governs the export
of defense articles and defense services. Specifically, this rule moves from the controls of Category XV of the USML
to those of entry 9A04 of the Commerce Control List (CCL) the international space station being built under the supervision
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and NASA's international partners: the space agencies
of Japan, Canada, the European Space Agency, and Russia. This movement applies to the space station itself, as well
as all components, parts, accessories, attachments and associated equipment specifically designed, modified
or configured for the space station, and all directly related technical data, software and services for those items,
except for such data, software and services which are controlled under Category XV (f) of the U.S. Munitions List (USML).
This rule reduces the burden on exporters by removing both the above-cited hardware and software and technical data
from the controls of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).



The Department of Commerce is publishing separately a final rule under the provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations, to amend the relevant Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) category, i.e., 9A04, to add the international
space station and all its specifically designed, modified, or configured components, parts, accessories, attachments
and associated equipment, software, and technical data and services not captured under Category XV (f) of the USML,
which items are being moved as a result of this rule.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On November 16, 1990, President Bush directed that the United States Government ``remove from the USML all items contained
on the COCOM dual use list unless significant U.S. national security interests would be jeopardized.'' (Vol. 26,
No. 46, Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents p. 1839.) To implement this directive, the Department of State
established several inter-agency working groups to identify where overlaps of items on the USML and the COCOM dual
use list existed and whether removal of these items from the USML would significantly jeopardize U.S. national security.



One of these inter-agency groups, the Space Technical Working Group (STWG), identified non-military spacecraft
as an item involving such an overlap and recommended movement of all non-military spacecraft from the USML to the Commerce
Control List (CCL), except where such movement would ``significantly jeopardize U.S. national security.'' Among
those spacecraft identified as constituting an overlap and recommended for movement to the CCL was the international
space station being built by NASA and its international partners.

On September 5, 1991, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 an advance notice of proposed rule-making, establishing a new Category XV on the USML for spacecraft and related systems
(56 FR 43894) and advising that a series of proposed rules would follow. A final rule formally creating category XV
for Spacecraft Systems and Associated Equipment was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 27, 1992 (57 FR 15227).

In late 1993, President Clinton directed NASA to add the Russian Space Agency as a partner to its international space
station program and instructed other U.S. Government agencies to provide the necessary assistance to NASA to enable
it to continue to carry out that program. An inter-agency Space Station Export Control Steering Committee met on March
10, 1994, and recommended several steps in the area of U.S. export controls which will be necessary for NASA to advance
its international space station program. One of the recommended steps is the movement of the international space
station itself from export control under the USML to the control of the CCL.

The Department agrees with the recommendation of the interagency committee; accordingly, the Department is removing
from the USML and the Department of Commerce is placing under the control of Export Control Classification Number
(ECCN) 9A04 of the CCL the following items: the international space station and all components, parts, accessories,
attachments, and associated equipment specifically designed, modified or configured for the international space
station, as well as all directly related technical data, software and services for those items, except for that data,
software and services which is controlled under Category XV (f) of the USML.

For purposes of clarification, this rule makes two additional minor changes, which have been requested by U.S. industry,
to the language of Category XV of the USML for purposes of clarification. In paragraph (c)(2)(ii), the word ``all''
has been inserted to indicate that all sidelobes on the relevant satellite must be less than or equal to -35dB
in order for that parameter to control the satellite under the USML. Several U.S. companies have indicated to the STWG
that virtually all satellites have one or more sidelobes which are less than or equal to -35dB; the parameter
is intended to capture only those few commercial communications satellites in which all sidelobes fall under the
cited parameter.

In Category XV, paragraph (f), involving technical data and defense services, the first sentence has been corrected
to show coverage of paragraph (f) over preceding paragraphs (a) through (e), instead of (a) through (f). In addition,
the wording of the final two sentences of the paragraph has been amended to clarify the fact that those two sentences
are directed only at the spacecraft which have been moved off the USML to the CCL.

This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and thus is excluded from the major rule procedures
of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193) and the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 and 554).

Approval and Promulgation of Small Business Assistance Program: State of Idaho



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the
State of Idaho for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance
Assistance Program. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section
507 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory
information necessary to comply with the CAA. The rationale for the approval is set forth in this document; additional
information is available at the address indicated below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of
air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally
approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress
on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA.
In January 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
The State of Idaho has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to
gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP. 


II. Analysis


1. Small Business Assistance Program


Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements

1

 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by first conducting pilot programs to evaluate
the best methods for organizing and providing technical assistance to small businesses. In addition, the State of
Idaho plans to use both proactive and reactive elements to provide information to small businesses. Proactive elements
include publications, news releases, public presentations, and outreach performed by the Idaho Small Business
Development Center, Idaho Small Business Institute, and the States' five Regional Economic Development and Planning
Agencies. Reactive elements include a hotline to respond to small business inquiries.





The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The
State has met this requirement through its plans to integrate the States' pollution prevention and waste reduction
programs' technical assistance capabilities into its small business program. In addition, Idaho will utilize the
services of program staff to directly assist small businesses in the areas of accidental release detection and prevention.
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by providing assistance to small businesses
through the use of trained staff. The availability of compliance assistance will be publicized and small business
stationary sources will be encouraged to seek assistance. Program staff will identify alternative methods and technologies
for compliance with each specific regulation.
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing a policy to provide as much notice of small business rights
under the CAA as is reasonable and practicable. Information on small business rights will be included in information
materials and other outreach activities. Program staff will ensure that both small business rights and obligations
are provided to small business stationary sources in advance of applicable regulations taking effect.
The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State
has met this requirement by developing a program for qualified auditors to provide small business stationary sources,
upon request, with an on-site determination of compliance with applicable air quality regulations.
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement
by developing standardized criteria and administrative procedures for considering requests of the nature identified
above, including provisions to ensure that granting such requests will not effect the status of the federally-approved
SIP and is consistent with the applicable requirements of the CAA.


2. Ombudsman


Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by appointing an Ombudsman, which Idaho calls its Small Business Advocate.


3. Compliance Advisory Panel


Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by establishing a CAP, which Idaho
calls its Small Business Assistance Advisory Board.
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act

2

; (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4)
to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements
through its authorization of the Small Business Assistance Advisory Board.





4. Eligibility


Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.

 

The State of Idaho has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
CAA. The State of Idaho has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet
the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.
The State of Idaho has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA. 


III. This Action


In today's action, EPA approves the SIP revision submitted by the State of Idaho. The State of Idaho has submitted a
SIP revision implementing each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the CAA. At this time, the SBAP, the
Ombudsman (Small Business Advocate), and the CAP (Small Business Advisory Board) are all in place and functioning.
EPA is therefore approving this submittal.


IV. Administrative Review


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.SE.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective November 18, 1994 unless, by October 19, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final
rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on November 18, 1994.
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2)).

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Indiana



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving an April 18, 1994 State request for a site-specific
revision to the Indiana sulfur dioxide State Implementation Plan (SO

2

 SIP). This revision sets forth a schedule of SO

2

 emission limitations applicable to Public Service Indiana's Gibson Generating Station (PSI Gibson) if the facility
installs SO

2

 emission controls. In the proposed rules section of this 

Federal Register,

 USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments
are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in response
to this final rule in a final rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section
of this 

Federal Register.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction



At the request of PSI Gibson, Indiana has revised the facility's SO

2

 emission limits, which are codified by the State at 326 Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC) 7-4-12.1
(Gibson County Sulfur Dioxide Emission Limitations), and submitted this rule to USEPA as a site-specific SO

2

 SIP revision. The revision provides the facility with two options for implementing SO

2

 emission reduction measures that will ensure protection of the SO

2

 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The first emission reduction option in 326 IAC 7-4-12.1
was approved as 326 IAC 7-1-19 by USEPA on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). This rulemaking action is based
on USEPA's review of the emission limits in the second option.



II. Background



Indiana's SO

2

 SIP for Gibson County, which is part of Title 326 of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC), specifically 326 IAC
7-1-19, was approved by USEPA for incorporation into the SIP on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). It set forth
a schedule of emission limitations for PSI Gibson whereby the facility's SO

2

 emissions would decrease to protect the primary SO

2

 NAAQS by December 31, 1991, and then over several years would decrease further to protect the secondary SO

2

 standard. The facility was to comply with these emission limits by burning low sulfur coal in Units 1-4. The rule
allowed PSI Gibson to consider alternate compliance strategies and request a set of alternate emission limits, if
necessary. PSI Gibson was required to submit a plan to Indiana by December 31, 1988, detailing the compliance path
it intended to follow.

In 1988, PSI Gibson submitted a compliance plan to Indiana which requested an alternate emission limitation schedule.
In this approach, PSI Gibson would install and operate a flue gas desulfurization system on Unit 4 to control SO

2

 emissions. This alternate schedule would allow PSI Gibson to emit much less SO

2

 from Unit 4 but slightly more SO

2

 from Units 1-3 than is allowed under the existing SIP approved rule. On August 7, 1990, Indiana adopted a new SO

2

 rule for Gibson County to incorporate PSI Gibson's compliance plan. Since PSI Gibson needed additional time to consider
the cost-effectiveness of both compliance paths, Indiana's revision to 326 IAC 7-4-12.1 included both
the previously approved emission reduction schedule and the new plan's schedule, and provided that PSI Gibson must
make a final choice of a compliance path by a specified date. PSI Gibson has chosen to comply with the emission limits
in the second scenario.

326 IAC 7-4-12.1 was originally submitted to USEPA as a site-specific SIP revision on July 22, 1991. Upon
the State's June 29, 1993 request, USEPA deferred rulemaking on the July 22, 1991 submittal. On April 18, 1994, Indiana
submitted to USEPA supplemental information pertaining to the modeled attainment demonstration and reactivated
the SIP revision request.



III. Emission Limitations



The emission reduction schedules for PSI Gibson Units 1-5, which are set forth in 326 IAC 7-4-12.1(b),
are summarized below. All emission limits are in units of pounds SO

2

 per million British Thermal Units (lb/MMBTU). The emission reduction schedule in 326 IAC 7-4-12.1(b)(1),
shown in the first column below, contains the same limits and deadlines as those set forth in 326 IAC 7-1-19
and approved by USEPA on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2112). PSI Gibson would use low sulfur coal in Units 1-4 to comply
with the limits in this scenario. The second column below presents the new emission limits in the April 18, 1994 site-specific
SIP submission. These limits are codified in Indiana's rules as 326 IAC 7-4-12.1(b)(2). PSI Gibson must
install a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system on Unit 4 and use low sulfur coal in Units 1-3 to comply under this
scenario.

The limits in the first column have already been approved by USEPA. The emission limitation schedule in the second
column does not automatically replace the existing schedule; rather, the two scenarios currently reside in Indiana's
rules as a choice of compliance procedures for PSI Gibson. Note that the two emission reduction schedules are identical
except for the emission limits PSI Gibson's Units 1-4 must meet by December 31, 1995.

<TEXT>
 




USEPA also notes that the rule is a SIP-strengthening measure, since the new emission limits in the April 18, 1994 submittal
represent a decrease in total SO

2

 emissions from what is required under the current SIP.



IV. Modeling Issues



The State is required to submit a modeled attainment demonstration to show that the emission limits set forth in 326
IAC 7-4-12.1(b)(2) will provide for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. The dispersion modeling
information within the original July 22, 1991 submittal contained issues of some initial concern to USEPA in that
the modeler for the PSI Gibson SIP revision may not have used the most current version of the Industrial Source Complex
(ISC) model to demonstrate that the new Gibson County limits would protect the NAAQS. USEPA evaluated supplementary
information submitted on April 18, 1994, and determined that PSI Gibson's modeling results indicated that an appropriate
refined dispersion model was used. Because PSI Gibson's modeling was performed according to USEPA guidance which
has since been revised, USEPA is accepting the modeled attainment demonstration for the April 18, 1994 submittal
under its grandfathering policy.






Grandfathering is neither mandatory nor automatic, and USEPA wishes to make clear that its acceptance of the modeling
analysis in the April 18, 1994 submittal will not apply to any other analysis of Gibson County to support any future
regulatory action. Future SIP revision requests submitted to USEPA must demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS through
modeling performed in accordance with current USEPA modeling guidance.

This SIP revision currently complies with USEPA's 1985 stack height regulations. It should be noted, however, that
on January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded to USEPA the exemptions for boilers originally
designed to vent from common stacks. If USEPA's response on the remand modifies the applicable provision, then USEPA
will notify the State of the need to reexamine the Gibson County SO

2

 emission limits for consistency with the modified provision.



V. Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment



For the reasons discussed above, USEPA is approving 326 IAC 7-4-12.1 (Gibson County Sulfur Dioxide Emission
Limitations). This rule affects only the PSI Gibson facility. It sets forth two emission reduction schedules to limit
the facility's SO

2

 emissions. PSI Gibson has chosen to comply with the second emission schedule, which requires the use of an additional

The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be
filed. This action will be effective on November 18, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by October
19, 1994.

If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by the publication of
a subsequent rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective November 18, 1994.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Approval of the 1990 Base Year Carbon Monoxide Emission Inventory for Minnesota 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The USEPA is approving the 1990 base year carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventory submitted by the State of Minnesota
as meeting the Clean Air Act requirements for emission inventories for CO. The inventory was submitted by the State
to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO State Implementation Plan (SIP)
for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas in Minnesota. 



USEPA's action is based upon a base year emission inventory which was submitted by the State of Minnesota to satisfy
the requirements of section 187(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Summary of State Submittal



On November 9, 1992 and November 10, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted to USEPA 1990 base year
CO emission inventories for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas in Minnesota. The inventories were were submitted
to USEPA as a revision to the State of Minnesota SIP. The State held public hearings on October 26, 1992, and November
6, 1992, to entertain public comments on the 1990 base year emission inventory for Duluth. The public hearing for the
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was held on June 22, 1994. The USEPA issued a completeness letter to the State
on March 8, 1993. The notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9155) 

Federal Register

. 



II. Public Comment/USEPA Response



A thirty-day public comment period was provided to allow interested parties the opportunity to comment on USEPA's
proposed action. There were no public comments received on this action by the Agency. Additionally, USEPA redesignated
the Duluth area to attainment on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17706) in a separate rulemaking action. 



III. Rulemaking Action



USEPA is approving the base year emission inventory that was submitted by the State of Minnesota. The State submitted
a complete inventory containing point, area, and mobile off-road and on-road source data, and documentation. The
inventory is complete and approvable for the Duluth and Minneapolis-St. Paul areas according to all criteria set
out in the June 24, 1993, memorandum from John S. Seitz, Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to
the Regional Air Directors. Although Minnesota had not provided opportunity for public comment on the Minneapolis-St.
Paul area inventory at the time of USEPA's proposed rulemaking, Minnesota provided such public comment period for
30 days ending June 17, 1994, and held a public hearing on June 22, 1994. With this action, the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area inventory is now also complete and approvable. As a result, USEPA is approving the SIP carbon monoxide emission
inventory submitted by the State of Minnesota. 

The emissions inventories of carbon monoxide emissions for a typical winter day in Duluth and in the Minneapolis-St.
Paul areas are indicated in tables 1 and 2 below. 









Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

USEPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator reclassified
this action from Table 2 to a Table 3 action under the procedures published in the Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request.
This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et. seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jusrisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM

10

 Implementation Plan for Colorado; Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Telluride 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA partially approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado to achieve attainment
of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

), including: control measures, technical analyses, and other Clean Air Act SIP requirements, with the exception
of the quantitative milestones element. The SIP was submitted by the Governor of Colorado in a letter dated March 17,
1993 to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable SIP for the Telluride, Colorado moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area. EPA conditionally approves the quantitative milestone element because the SIP does not demonstrate
maintenance of the PM

10

 NAAQS through 1997. However, the State has committed to adopt control measures necessary to provide for maintenance.




In addition, EPA approves the SIP revision submitted by the Governor with a letter dated December 9, 1993 to address
contingency measure requirements for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area. 

Finally, EPA amends the boundary for the Telluride nonattainment area to clarify the original description.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background 



The Telluride, Colorado area was designated nonattainment for PM

10

 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.
 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991), 40 CFR 81.306 (Telluride). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.
 






The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498, April 16, 1992 and 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992). Because
EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for
a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale.


Those States containing initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas (those areas designated under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among
other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 

1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) [including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)] shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 

2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;


3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 

4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM

10

 also apply to major stationary sources of PM

10

 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. 

Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM

10

 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified
major stationary sources of PM

10

 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). The State has submitted such a permit program, and EPA will address that submittal
in a separate action. Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become
effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve
reasonable further progress or to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543-13544). The State of Colorado
has submitted contingency measures for Telluride and EPA is addressing those measures in this action. 

On June 23, 1994, EPA announced its proposed action on the Telluride, Colorado moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP and contingency measures (59 FR 32397-32405). In that proposed rulemaking and related Technical Support
Document (TSD), EPA described its interpretations of title I and its rationale for the proposed rulemaking taking
into consideration the specific factual issues presented. 

EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 59 FR 32404). No comments were received.
This final action on the Telluride moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 SIP is unchanged from the June 23, 1994 proposed action. 

The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the June 23, 1994 proposed rule for a more in depth discussion of the action now being finalized.

II. This Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
The Governor of Colorado submitted the Telluride PM

10

 SIP in a letter dated March 17, 1993, and the Telluride PM

10

 contingency measures in a letter dated December 9, 1993. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (59 FR 32397-32405),
the Telluride moderate nonattainment area plan includes, among other things, technical analyses, control measures
to satisfy the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS will be achieved by December 31, 1994, and enforceability documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine
that major sources of precursors of PM

10

 do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Telluride.





In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its partial approval of those elements (excluding the quantitative milestone
element) of the Telluride PM

10

 SIP, which were due on November 15, 1991 and submitted on March 17, 1993. Further, section 110(k)(4) of the Act authorizes
EPA to approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain,
but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Hence, EPA announces its conditional approval
of the quantitative milestones element of the Telluride PM

10

 SIP based on the State's commitment, dated April 21, 1994, to adopt control measures for Telluride by November 30,
1994 that are necessary to demonstrate maintenance of the PM

10

 NAAQS. Section 110(k)(4) provides that any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval if the state
fails to comply with such commitment.





The quantitative milestone element of the Telluride SIP is deficient in that it does not demonstrate that the second
quantitative milestone_continued maintenance from 1994 through 1997_will be achieved. EPA conditionally approves
this element of the SIP in light of the State's commitment to adopt additional control measures necessary to provide
for continued maintenance.
The State has indicated that it intends to address the maintenance issue by proposing for adoption additional control
measures to maintain the PM

10

 NAAQS through 1997. In an April 21, 1994 letter from Thomas Getz, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD),
to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, the State made the following commitments: (1) maintenance control measures and any related
SIP revision will be proposed to the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) by July 21, 1994; (2) a public hearing
on such regulations and SIP revision will be held by October 20, 1994; and (3) the adopted regulations and SIP revision
will be submitted to EPA by November 30, 1994. The effective date of such measures must be November 1, 1995, but could
be as early as December 1, 1994.
Upon adoption and submittal to EPA, these additional control measures for maintenance will be evaluated for their
adequacy in allowing the area to demonstrate maintenance through 1997.
On August 16, 1994, EPA only partially approved the State's nonattainment new source review (NSR) permitting regulations
for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area (among others) because the State did not submit NSR permitting regulations for sources of PM

10

 precursors in Telluride and because EPA had not yet found that such sources did not contribute significantly in Telluride
(see 59 FR 33213). In this final rulemaking, EPA is now finalizing its finding that major stationary sources of precursors
of PM

10

 do not contribute significantly to PM

10

 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Telluride. The consequence of this finding is to exclude major stationary sources
of PM

10

 precursors in Telluride from the applicability of PM

10

 nonattainment area control requirements, including nonattainment NSR permitting requirements. Thus, the State's
nonattainment NSR regulations for Telluride area now considered fully approved.
In this final rulemaking action EPA also announces its full approval of the PM

10

 contingency measures that were due on November 15, 1993 and submitted by the State on December 9, 1993. In addition,
EPA amends the nonattainment area boundary description for Telluride in order to clarify the original description.
Please refer to EPA's proposed rulemaking (59 FR 32397) and the TSD for that action for a detailed discussion of these
elements of the Telluride plan.
EPA finds that the State of Colorado's PM

10

 SIP for the Telluride moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Colorado's SIP revision for Telluride contains
control measures for sources of wood and coal burning. The State has demonstrated that by applying control measures
to this area source, Telluride will be in attainment by December 31, 1994, and it does not appear that apply further
control measures to these sources would expedite attainment.

<TEXT>
 

Therefore, EPA views the following measure as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM

10

 emissions reductions in Telluride: Colorado regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan_Specific Regulations
for Local Elements, II. Telluride Nonattainment Area,'' which requires continued implementation of local programs
to control solid fuel burning devices, eliminate coal burning, and prohibit installation of additional solid fuel
burning devices. The RACM (including RACT) provisions in the SIP are described further in the TSD associated with
EPA's June 23, 1994 proposed rulemaking on this SIP.

A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed rulemaking for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 32397). EPA has reviewed the state's documentation and concluded that it adequate justifies
the control measure to be implemented. The implementation of Colorado's PM

10

 nonattainment plan for Telluride will result in attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is approving the Telluride PM

10

 plan's control strategy as satisfying the RACM (including RACT) requirement.

EPA also finds that the State of Colorado's December 9, 1993 submittal of PM

10

 contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area meets the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Specifically, section II.B. of the State
regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan-Specific Regulations for Local Elements'' provides that, upon
the determination that the area has failed to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS or make reasonable further progress (RFP), the following will be implemented: (1) 0.30 miles of dirt roads within
the Town of Telluride will be chip-seal paved, and (2) either 2.0 miles of unpaved San Miguel County gravel roads at
the Ski Ranches Subdivision or 0.75 miles of private dirt roads at the Hillside/Gold King Subdivision (each within
the Telluride nonattainment area) will be chip-seal paved. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and regulation
and concluded that they adequately meet the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. By this action, EPA is approving
the PM

10

 contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area.

Finally, EPA announces a clarification to the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area boundary, which is based on a legal description of the map outline of the area, as follows.

The Telluride nonattainment area begins at the intersection of Colorado State Highway 145 and the Telluride service
area boundary, as it existed in 1991. The western edge of the nonattainment area until it meets Remine Creek is defined
as follows:

Then, at Remine Creek, the nonattainment boundary follows the service area boundary for 9.65 miles to the eastern
edge of the area, continuing to follow the 9,200 foot contour line. The boundary then intersects Bear Creek. Here the
nonattainment boundary diverges from the service area boundary (9,200 foot contour line). The nonattainment boundary
continues in a west, southwest direction for 0.92 miles from the intersection of the 9,200 foot contour line and Bear
Creek to the top of ski lift number 9 in the Telluride Ski Area at an elevation of about 11,900 feet. The boundary then
shifts and runs in a north-westerly direction for 0.83 miles from the top of lift 9 to the top of lift 7, which is located
at an elevation of 10,490 feet. From the top of lift 7, the nonattainment boundary continues in a north-westerly direction
for 0.5 miles to the intersection of lift 3 with the 10,000 foot control line. The nonattainment boundary follows the
10,000 foot contour line in a south, south-west direction for 3.2 miles, until it intersects Skunk Creek. Here the
boundary diverges from the 10,000 foot contour line and follows Skunk Creek in a northerly direction for 2.25 miles.
At the intersection of Skunk Creek and Colorado State Highway 145, the nonattainment boundary leaves the creek and
follows Highway 145 in a northerly direction until it meets the service area boundary as it existed prior to changes
adopted in 1991.
EPA is replacing the boundary description currently in 40 CFR 81.306 with this revised description to more clearly
define the nonattainment area. Note that this description is merely a more detailed explanation of the boundary and
not a change in the boundary itself.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


III. Final Action


This document announces EPA's final action on the rulemaking proposed at 59 FR 32397 on June 23, 1994. As noted elsewhere
in this action, EPA received no comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has
reclassified this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January
19, 1989.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
Approvals and conditional approvals of SIP submittals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the Clean
Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore,
because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant
impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean
Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. 

v. 

U.S. E.P.A., 

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)).
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866.

Hazardous Waste Management System; 
Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste; 
Final Amendment 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) today is granting a final amendment to an exclusion from the lists
of hazardous wastes previously granted for certain solid wastes generated by POP Fasteners (POP) in Shelton, Connecticut.
This action is taken in response to a petition for amendment submitted by POP to increase the maximum annual waste volume
covered in its exclusion. The exclusion was granted under regulations that allow generators to petition EPA to remove
their wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding such wastes from the hazardous waste lists. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On March 5, 1990, POP Fasteners (POP), a division of Black and Decker Corporation, of Shelton, Connecticut petitioned
the Agency under   260.20 and 260.22, to exclude from hazardous waste control its F006 metal hydroxide
filter cake resulting from the treatment of wastewater originating from its electroplating operation. After evaluating
the petition, EPA published its final decision in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 57673, December 7, 1992) to exclude POP's waste from the lists of hazardous waste contained at   261.31
and 261.32. POP's final exclusion only applied to the process and waste volume (a maximum of 300 cubic yards generated
annually) covered by its original petition. Any waste generated in excess of 300 cubic yards per year must be handled
as hazardous unless an amendment to POP's final exclusion is granted.

On May 10, 1993, POP petitioned the Agency for an amendment to its 1992 final exclusion for an increase of its annual
maximum waste generation from 300 cubic yards to 1,000 cubic yards. After its evaluation of POP's request and supporting
information, EPA proposed, on April 11, 1994, to amend POP's December 7, 1992 exclusion to reflect a waste volume increase
(see 59 FR 17080). 


Today's rulemaking finalizes the proposed amendment to amend POP's existing exclusion. 




II. Disposition of Petition for Amendment 




POP Fasteners, Shelton, Connecticut. 




A. Proposed Amendment 




As a result of its business growth, POP petitioned the Agency on May 10, 1993 for an amendment to its 1992 final exclusion
for an increase of its annual maximum waste generation from 300 cubic yards to 1,000 cubic yards. 


POP stated in an April 19, 1993 letter that: (1) the increase in the filter cake generation was attributable to an increase
in rivet production since the petition was filed; (2) there have been no changes in the manufacturing process, feed
materials, or waste water treatment process; and (3) the hours of POP's operation have increased. 


To confirm that the waste characteristics have not changed, POP submitted results from the analyses of one filter
cake composite for all Toxicity Characteristic (TC) constituents listed in 40 CFR 261.24 and nickel using the Toxicity
Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP, SW-846 Method 1311). POP also submitted a signed certification
dated May 10, 1993 stating that all submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. 


The Agency reviewed its previous decision to grant POP's original delisting petition (57 FR 37921, 57 FR 57673 and
the administrative record in the RCRA public docket) and the analytical results provided by POP in support of its request
for an amendment to its existing exclusion. The analytical results submitted to support this amendment show that
the constituents detected in the waste sample, as well as their respective leachate concentration levels, are consistent
with the waste data in POP's original petition. Furthermore, POP has certified that there have been no changes in process
or feed materials. Therefore, the Agency believes that the waste characteristics have not changed. 


The Agency evaluated the potential impact of POP's petitioned waste on human health and the environment, at the increased
annual maximum waste volume, following the same approach it used in evaluating POP's original petition. Specifically,
the Agency evaluated the waste using the requested annual maximum waste volume estimate of 1,000 cubic yards and the
maximum reported leachate concentration of POP's waste using the same ground-water model described in the Agency's
original decision (see 57 FR 37921, August 21, 1992 and the RCRA public docket ``F-92-PEEP-FFFFF''
to that rule). The Agency notes that the modeling results are the same for 300 and 1,000 cubic yards, and the increased
waste volume has no significant impact. Thus, the Agency believes that the constituents in POP's waste would not leach
and migrate at concentrations above the Agency's health-based levels used in delisting decision-making. 


EPA also considered the impact of the increased waste volume on potential risks posed by other exposure routes (i.e.,
air emission, surface water). Since the total concentration levels of hazardous constituents of concern in the petitioned
waste and the active landfill area remain unchanged, the Agency believes that no significant exposure to contaminants
potentially released via air emission and surface runoff from POP's petitioned waste is likely. See 57 FR 37921 (August
21, 1992), 57 FR 57673 (December 7, 1992), and the RCRA public dockets for these notices for a detailed description
of the evaluation. 




B. Response to Public Comments 




The Agency did not receive any comments on the proposed amendment. 




C. Final Agency Decision 




For the reasons stated in the proposed amendment and in today's notice, the Agency believes that POP's waste is non-hazardous
at the maximum generation rate of 1,000 cubic yards per year, and should be excluded from hazardous waste control.
The Agency, therefore, is granting the amendment to POP Fastener's exclusion to reflect a waste volume increase for
waste generated at its Shelton, Connecticut facility. This amendment only applies to the process covered by POP's
original petition, and allows a maximum annual waste volume of 1,000 cubic yards. All other conditions listed in POP's
exclusion remain unchanged. Waste generated in excess of 1,000 cubic yards per year or from changed processes must
be handled as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.

III. Effective Date 


This amendment is effective immediately upon final publication in the 

Federal Register

. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in
less than six months when the regulated community does not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That
is the case here because this amendment reduces the existing requirements for persons generating hazardous wastes.
In light of the unnecessary hardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective date six months
after publication and the fact that a six-month deadline is not necessary to achieve the purpose of section 3010, EPA
believes that this amendment should be effective immediately upon final publication. These reasons also provide
a basis for making this amendment effective immediately, upon final publication, under the Administrative Procedure
Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d). 


IV. Regulatory Impact 


Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must conduct an ``assessment of the potential costs and benefits'' for all ``significant''
regulatory actions. This amendment is not significant, since its effect reduces the overall costs and economic impact
of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding an additional amount of
waste generated at a specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facility to treat
its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additional economic impact due to today's rule. Therefore, this rule is not
a significant regulation, and no cost/benefit assessment is required. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
has also exempted this rule from the requirement for OMB review under section (6) of Executive Order 12866. 


V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory
flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (

i.e.,

 small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis
is required, however, if the Administrator or delegated representative certifies that the rule will not have an impact
on any small entities. 
This amendment will not have any adverse economic impact on small entities because its effect will be to reduce the
overall costs of EPA's hazardous waste regulations and will be limited to one facility. Accordingly, I hereby certify
that this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This amendment
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 


VI. Paperwork Reduction Act 


Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with this final amendment have been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511,
44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement Framework Adjustment 6 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan (FMP). The intent of this rule is to reduce the catch of juvenile silver hake in the Cultivator Shoal whiting (silver
hake) fishery by increasing the minimum mesh size from 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Amendment 4 to the FMP, published May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24724), established the Cultivator Shoal whiting fishery, a specified
area within the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank Regulated Mesh Area. For 3 years preceding Amendment 4, NMFS had conducted
an experimental fishery program in the Cultivator Shoal area using NMFS sea samplers to collect data about the silver
hake fishery and particularly about the regulated species bycatch. The data collected by sea samplers led to the conclusion
that the Cultivator Shoal whiting fishery had minimal impact on regulated species. 

Under the terms of Amendment 5 to the FMP (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994), vessels may fish for silver hake in the Cultivator
Shoal area from June 15 through October 31, unless otherwise specified, if the vessel: (1) Has onboard a letter of authorization
issued by the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director); (2) has a minimum mesh size of 21/2 inches (6.35
cm) applied to the first 160 meshes counted from the terminus of the net; and (3) does not exceed the possession limit
of regulated species as specified in 50 CFR 651.27(a). 

Fishing industry members recently asked the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to adopt more restrictive
regulations to conserve the silver hake stocks and protect this resource from a potential increase in fishing effort
directed at the juvenile component of the stocks. Their concerns are based on at least two recent developments in the
industry that directly affect the silver hake fisheries, as well as on the assessment scientists' uncertainty about
the stock status and the impact of those recent changes. 

First, as restrictive management plans are implemented in other fisheries in the region, a significant amount of
potential fishing effort is being displaced. Fishers anticipate that some portion of that displaced fishing effort
will be directed on silver hake, since this fishery is relatively unregulated and the stocks are comparatively stable.
The effect of a sudden increase in fishing effort on silver hake stocks and markets is uncertain, but potentially detrimental
to both. The most recent advisory report from the Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW) in February 1994, which was SAW 

#

17, states that, although there are uncertainties regarding the exploitation pattern in the silver hake fishery,
it is recommended that any increase in effort on these stocks be avoided.

<DOCNO> FR940919-0-00047 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Second, in the past year, an export market for juvenile silver hake has emerged. The potential demand from this new
market and its impact on the stocks are unknown. Assessment scientists, while acknowledging that natural mortality
rates of juvenile silver hake are high and that discards of juveniles in the traditional silver hake fisheries are
excessive, caution against any increase in fishing effort directed at the juvenile sector. If juvenile mortality
increases, the spawning stock biomass will decline and the catch of large silver hake in traditional fisheries will
also decline. 

Generally, increasing the mesh size will delay the age at which fish become susceptible to the gear, thereby reducing
juvenile mortality. Increasing the mesh size from 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm), is intended to prevent
a shift in the exploitation pattern to younger fish in order to supply the juvenile export market. 

With so many uncertainties and the need for caution surrounding the impacts of the emerging juvenile fishery and the
displacement of effort from other fisheries, the Council has started preparing an FMP amendment to regulate fishing
for silver hake. Except for the Cultivator Shoal program, fishing for silver hake is currently unregulated and an
FMP amendment is required in order to establish a management regime for the entire fishery. However, because of the
length of time required for the FMP amendment process, and due to the concerns stated by industry members, as noted
above, the Council initiated this framework action for the purpose of implementing conservation measures as quickly
as possible for the ongoing Cultivator Shoal fishery.

Framework Adjustment 3 to the FMP limited the amount of regulated species onboard vessels using small mesh to either
500 lb (226.8 kg) or 10 percent of the weight of non-regulated species, whichever is less. In this rule, NMFS is adding
language to the possession limit section with the intent of clarifying how this adjustment pertains to the Cultivator
Shoal whiting fishery. 

NMFS is amending the multispecies regulations following the procedure for framework adjustments established by
Amendment 5 and codified in 50 CFR 651, subpart C. The Council followed this procedure when making adjustments to the
FMP, by developing and analyzing the actions over the span of a minimum of two Council meetings, on May 12 and June 29,
1994. The Council provided the public with advance notice of both the proposal and the analysis, and opportunity to
comment on them prior to and at the June 29 Council meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the Council
recommended to the Regional Director that the measures contained in Framework Adjustment 6 be published as a final
rule. The Regional Director has further determined that the measures in Framework Adjustment 6 are appropriate to
publish as a final rule. 



Comments and Responses 



In addition to the general public notification, the Council sent a letter to each person who applied for authorization
to fish in the Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Program informing him or her of the Council's intent to take action,
describing the proposals under consideration, advising them of the availability of relevant documents and analysis,
and inviting comment. During the comment period spanning the two required Council meetings, several members of the
public commented in favor of the 3-inch (7.62-cm) mesh proposal, and one fisher opposed it on the grounds that it would
reduce flexibility in using different mesh sizes. NMFS believes that an increase in mesh size is warranted to protect
the juvenile component of the whiting stocks, and hence the long-term viability of the fishery. One individual questioned
the scientific basis for the mesh-size increase. Generally, an increase in mesh size correlates with fewer small
fish being caught, increasing the potential yield from the fishery by reducing the revenues lost due to discarding
or industrial use of the catch. The traditionally preferred market size for silver hake has been 10 inches (25.4 cm)
or greater. According to silver hake selection curves, approximately 22 percent of 10-inch (25.4-cm) fish would
be caught by 3-inch (7.62-cm) mesh, as opposed to approximately 32 percent with a 21/2-inch (6.35-cm) mesh. With the
increased selectivity of the larger mesh, discards that are predominantly of fish under 10 inches (25.4 cm) may be
reduced significantly. Other comments focused on the minimum fish size and tolerance provision that the Council
removed from its proposal. These comments were taken into account by the Council and NMFS in developing and approving
these measures. 



Classification 



This final rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. 

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds there is good cause to waive prior notice and opportunity
for comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The provision of advance notice as described in this rule and public meetings
held by the Council to discuss the management measures implemented by this rule provided adequate prior notice and
opportunity for public comment to be considered. Thus, additional opportunity for public comment is unnecessary.
Because no proposed rule was required, this action is exempt from the procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 Final rule; correction. 

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action corrects the final regulations which were published Tuesday, August 31, 1993 (``Hazardous Waste Management
System; Testing and Monitoring Activities; Final Rule'', 58 FR 46040). This action corrects the unintended removal
of text from 40 CFR 268.7(a), which sets out the generator waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements of the land
disposal restrictions under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The final regulations that are the subject of this correction (August 31, 1993, 58 FR 46040) amended the hazardous
waste regulations for testing and monitoring activities by replacing the Second Edition, Updates I and II, of the
EPA approved test methods manual ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication
SW-846, by incorporating by reference the Third Edition of SW-846 and its Update I into  260.11(a)
of the RCRA regulations. In addition, the final rule also made a technical amendment to  268.7(a) (concerning
waste analysis and recordkeeping requirements) whereby the reference to the appendix IX of Part 268 was revised to
reference SW-846 Methods 1311 and 1310. The Agency intended to revise only the introductory text of  268.7(a)
and to retain without change all of the subparagraphs following the introductory text. However, due to an inadvertent
administrative error in incorporating the August 31, 1993 rule into the 1994 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR), the subparagraphs following the introductory text were unintentionally removed. This action clarifies
that subparagraphs 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1)-268.7(a)(10), as set forth in this action, remain in effect, and are
regarded by EPA to have been in effect continuously in the form published in the Code of Federal Regulations revised
as of July 1, 1993. 
It should be noted that 40 CFR 268.7(a) as published in this action, as well as other regulations implementing the land
disposal restriction (LDR) program, have been amended in a final rule that is published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

. The regulatory text set forth in this action does not include the amendments to  268.7(a) made by that LDR final
rule. The purpose of this action is to make clear that the August 31, 1993 rule was intended only to modify the introductory
text of  268.7(a), and was not intended to delete paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(10). Therefore, the complete
version of  268.7(a) as it 

should have appeared

 since the August 31, 1994 

Federal Register

 is set forth in this action. Readers are urged to refer to the LDR final rule, published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, for the full and current text of  268.7(a).

Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, 40 CFR part 268 is corrected by making the following correcting
amendments: 


PART 268_LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONS 


1. The authority citation for part 268 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6921, and 6924. 

 

2. Section 268.7(a) is revised to read as follows: 


 268.7 

Waste analysis and recordkeeping. 


(a) Except as specified in  268.32, if a generator's waste is listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D, the generator
must test his waste, or test an extract using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Method 1311 in ``Test
Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated
by reference in  260.11 of this chapter, or use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted
from land disposal under this part. Except as specified in  268.32 of this part, if a generator's waste exhibits
one or more of the characteristics set out at 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the generator must test an extract using the
Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test, Method 1310 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical
Methods,'' EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in  260.11 of this chapter, or use knowledge
of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this Part. If the generator determines
that his waste displays the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory
or is not treated by INCIN, FSUBS, or RORGS of  268.42, Table 1), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002),
and is prohibited under  268.37 of this Part, the generator must determine what underlying hazardous constituents
(as defined in  268.2), are reasonably expected to be present in the D001 or D002 waste. 
(1) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this part and the waste does not meet the applicable
treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part or exceeds the applicable prohibition levels set forth in  268.32
or RCRA section 3004(d), with each shipment of waste the generator must notify the treatment or storage facility in
writing of the appropriate treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part and any applicable prohibition
levels set forth in  268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). The notice must include the following information: 
(i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(ii) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001-F005, F039, wastes prohibited pursuant to  268.32
or RCRA section 3004(d), and for underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in  268.2), in D001 and D002
wastes if those wastes are prohibited under  268.37. Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must
either be included, or be referenced by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in  268.2(f))
or nonwastewater (as defined in  268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code
based on waste-specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where
the applicable treatment standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified
technologies in  268.42, the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of  268.42 (e.g.,
INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed on the notification; 
(iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 
(iv) For hazardous debris, the contaminants subject to treatment as provided by  268.45(b) and the following
statement: ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40 CFR 268.45''; and 
(v) Waste analysis data, where available. 
(2) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste under this Part, and determines that the waste
can be land disposed without further treatment, with each shipment of waste he must submit, to the treatment, storage,
or land disposal facility, a notice and a certification stating that the waste meets the applicable treatment standards
set forth in subpart D of this part and the applicable prohibition levels set forth in  268.32 or RCRA section
3004(d). Generators of hazardous debris that is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under  261.3(e)(2)
of this chapter (i.e., debris that the Director has determined does not contain hazardous waste), however, are not
subject to these notification and certification requirements. 
(i) The notice must include the following information:

(A) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(B) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001-F005, F039, and wastes prohibited pursuant to  268.32
or RCRA section 3004(d). Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must either be included, or be referenced
by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in  268.2(f)) or nonwastewater (as
defined in  268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific
criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where the applicable treatment
standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified technologies in  268.42,
the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of  268.42 (e.g., INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed
on the notification. 
(C) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 
(D) Waste analysis data, where available. 
(ii) The certification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the following:



I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing
or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards
specified in 40 CFR Part 268, Subpart D and all applicable prohibitions set forth in 40 CFR 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d).
I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties
for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment.



(3) If a generator's waste is subject to an exemption from a prohibition on the type of land disposal method utilized
for the waste (such as, but not limited to, a case-by-case extension under  268.5, an exemption under  268.6,
or a nationwide capacity variance under subpart C of this part), with each shipment of waste he must submit a notice
to the facility receiving his waste stating that the waste is not prohibited from land disposal. The notice must include
the following information: 
(i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(ii) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001-F005, F039, and wastes prohibited pursuant to
 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must either be included,
or be referenced by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in  268.2(f)) or nonwastewater
(as defined in  268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific
criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where the applicable treatment
standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified technologies in  268.42,
the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of  268.42 (e.g., INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed
on the notification; 
(iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 
(iv) Waste analysis data, where available; 
(v) For hazardous debris, the contaminants subject to treatment as provided by  268.45(b) and the following
statement: ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40 CFR 268.45''; and 
(vi) The date the waste is subject to the prohibitions. 
(4) If a generator is managing prohibited waste in tanks, containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40
CFR 262.34, and is treating such waste in such tanks, containers, or containment buildings to meet applicable treatment
standards under subpart D of this part, the generator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes
the procedures the generator will carry out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating hazardous
debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1,  268.45, however, are not subject to these waste
analysis requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements
must be met: 
(i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of
the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance
with the requirements of this Part, including the selected testing frequency. 
(ii) Such plan must be filed with the EPA Regional Administrator (or his designated representative) or State authorized
to implement Part 268 requirements a minimum of 30 days prior to the treatment activity, with delivery verified. 
(iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply with the notification requirements of  268.7(a)(2).

(5) If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting
data used to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's files. If a generator determines
whether the waste is restricted based on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method described
in Appendix I of this part, all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's files. 
(6) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous
or solid waste or exempt from Subtitle C regulation, under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6 subsequent to the point of generation,
he must place a one-time notice stating such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of hazardous or
solid waste or exemption from RCRA, Subtitle C regulation, and the disposition of the waste, in the facility's file.

(7) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, certifications, demonstrations, waste analysis data,
and other documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least five years from the date that the waste that
is the subject of such documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The five
year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding
the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes
even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition
of hazardous or solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2-261.6, or exempted from Subtitle C regulation, subsequent to
the point of generation. 
(8) If a generator is managing a lab pack that contains wastes identified in Appendix IV of this part and wishes to use
the alternative treatment standard under  268.42, with each shipment of waste the generator must submit a notice
to the treatment facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The generator must also comply with
the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, and must submit the following certification, which
must be signed by an authorized representative:



I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains
only the wastes specified in appendix IV to part 268 or solid wastes not subject to regulation under 40 CFR part 261.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility
of fine or imprisonment.



(9) If a generator is managing a lab pack that contains organic wastes specified in Appendix V of this Part and wishes
to use the alternate treatment standards under  268.42, with each shipment of waste the generator must submit
a notice to the treatment facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The generator also must comply
with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, and must submit the following certification
which must be signed by an authorized representative: I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined
and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste and that the lab pack contains
only organic waste specified in Appendix V to Part 268 or solid wastes not subject to regulation under 40 CFR Part 261.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility
of fine or imprisonment. 
(10) Small quantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant to 40 CFR 262.20(e) must comply with the applicable
notification and certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the initial shipment of the waste
subject to the agreement. Such generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification and certification, together
with the tolling agreement, for at least three years after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three-year
record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding
the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.

Land Disposal Restrictions Phase II_Universal Treatment Standards, and Treatment Standards for Organic Toxicity
Characteristic Wastes and Newly Listed Wastes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As part of the Agency's Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) program, EPA is today promulgating treatment standards
for the newly identified organic toxicity characteristic (TC) wastes (except those managed in Clean Water Act (CWA)
systems, CWA- equivalent systems, or Class I Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) injection wells), and for all newly listed
coke by-product and chlorotoluene production wastes. The required treatment standards for these wastes must be
met before they are land disposed. EPA is also requiring ignitable characteristic wastes with a high total organic
carbon (TOC) content and toxic characteristic pesticide wastes, that are being disposed in Class I nonhazardous
waste injection wells, to either be injected into a well that is subject to a no-migration determination, or be treated
by the designated LDR treatment method. Promulgation of these treatment standards for the newly identified and listed
wastes and promulgation of the dilution prohibitions for high TOC ignitables and pesticides fulfills requirements
of a proposed consent decree between EPA and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a settlement agreement between EPA,
the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, and a number of environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense
Council.


EPA is also making a major improvement in the Land Disposal Restrictions program in order to simplify and provide consistency
in the requirements. EPA is establishing a single set of requirements, referred to as universal treatment standards,
that apply to most hazardous wastes. EPA is also simplifying the Land Disposal Restrictions program by reducing paperwork
for the regulated community, and improving guidance to make compliance easier. EPA is also publishing clarifying
guidance regarding treatability variances, which largely restates previous Agency statements. Finally, EPA is
modifying the hazardous waste recycling regulations which will allow streamlined regulatory decisions to be made
regarding the regulation of certain types of recycling activities.

I. Background 



A. Summary of the Statutory Requirements of the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments, and Requirements of the
1993 Settlement Agreement With the Environmental Defense Fund 



The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted on
November 8, 1984, largely prohibit the land disposal of untreated hazardous wastes. Once a hazardous waste is prohibited
from land disposal, the statute provides only two options for legal land disposal: meet the treatment standard for
the waste prior to land disposal, or dispose of the waste in a land disposal unit that has been found to satisfy the statutory
no-migration test. A no-migration unit is one from which there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for
as long as the waste remains hazardous. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g)(5). 

The treatment standards may be expressed as either constituent concentration levels or as specific methods of treatment.
These standards must substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of
migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the
environment are minimized. RCRA section 3004(m)(1). For purposes of the restrictions, land disposal includes any
placement of hazardous waste in a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatment facility,
salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mine or cave. RCRA section 3004(k). 

The land disposal restrictions are effective upon promulgation. RCRA section 3004(h)(1). However, the Administrator
may grant a national capacity variance from the immediate effective date and establish a later effective date (not
to exceed two years) based on the earliest date on which adequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity
which protects human health and the environment will be available. RCRA section 3004(h)(2). The Administrator may
also grant a case-by-case extension of the effective date for up to one year, renewable once for up to one additional
year, when an applicant successfully makes certain demonstrations. RCRA section 3004(h)(3). See 55 FR 22526 (June
1, 1990) for a more detailed discussion on national capacity variances and case-by-case extensions. 

In addition, Congress prohibited the storage of any waste which is prohibited from land disposal unless such storage
is to allow for the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery,
treatment or disposal. RCRA section 3004(j). For storage up to one year, EPA has taken the position that the agency
bears the burden of proving that such storage was not solely for the purpose of accumulation of quantities necessary
to facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal. 40 CFR 268.50(b). For storage beyond one year, however, the
burden of proof shifts to the generator or owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility to demonstrate
that such storage was solely for the purpose of accumulation of quantities necessary to facilitate proper recovery,
treatment or disposal. 40 CFR 268.50(c). The provision applies, of course, only to storage which is not also defined
in section 3004(k) as land disposal. 

EPA was required to promulgate land disposal prohibitions and treatment standards by May 8, 1990 for all wastes that
were either listed or identified as hazardous at the time of the 1984 amendments, RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), and (g),
a task EPA completed within the statutory timeframes. EPA was also required to promulgate prohibitions and treatment
standards for wastes identified or listed as hazardous after the date of the 1984 amendments within six months after
the listing or identification takes effect. RCRA section 3004(g)(4). 

The Agency did not meet this latter statutory deadline for all of the wastes identified or listed after the 1984 amendments.
As a result, a suit was filed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). EPA and EDF signed a consent decree (lodged with
but not entered by the District Court) that establishes a schedule for adopting prohibitions and treatment standards
for newly identified and listed wastes. (

)). Today's rule fulfills several provisions of the proposed consent decree. The rule establishes treatment standards
for newly listed coke by-product and chlorotoluene production wastes, and for the D018-D043 TC wastes (TC wastes
identified as hazardous because of the presence of organic hazardous constituents) when these wastes are managed
in systems other than those wastewater treatment systems whose discharge is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA),
by zero-dischargers that do not engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal, and by injection into
other than underground injection control (UIC) Class I deep injection wells regulated under the Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA). Soils contaminated with these newly identified and listed wastes are also covered by this rule. 

Finally, this rule prohibits injection into deep wells of high Total Organic Carbon ignitable wastes (D001) and Toxic
Characteristic organic pesticides (D012-D017) unless they are treated to meet applicable treatment standards,
or the deep well has received a no-migration variance. This last prohibition is in partial fulfillment of the settlement
agreement following the D.C. Circuit's decision in 

CWM 

v. 

EPA. 

EPA is also modifying a number of the existing land disposal restrictions rules. Although not required by the settlements
discussed above, these changes reflect EPA's updated technical knowledge, simplify implementation of the program,
and provide greater programmatic consistency. In today's notice, EPA is establishing a set of treatment standards
(called universal treatment standards) that apply to most hazardous wastes, changing requirements for land disposal
of lab packs containing prohibited hazardous wastes, and simplifying paperwork requirements.

B. Pollution Prevention Benefits 


EPA's progress over the years in improving environmental quality through its media-specific pollution control
programs has been substantial. Over the past two decades, standards for pollution control concentrated to a large
extent on ``end-of-pipe'' treatment or land disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Although none of the
treatment standards in today's rule require waste minimization or recovery, these are viable options for facilities
to choose to use to comply with universal treatment standards. For example, facilities may choose to reduce the generation
of wastes and/or treat certain metal-containing wastes by using high temperature metal recovery (HTMR), which has
been shown to be effective for treating many metal bearing wastes. 


C. Relationship of Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) Treatment Standards to Initiatives To Strengthen
Federal Controls Governing Hazardous Waste Combustion Devices 


On May 18, 1993, EPA Administrator Browner announced additional steps that would be pursued to protect public health
and the environment by further encouraging reduction in the amount of hazardous wastes generated in this country
and strengthening federal controls governing hazardous waste incinerators and other combustion devices. With
the announcement, the Draft Hazardous Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy (also referred to as the Draft
Strategy) was released, upon which the Agency has sought broad national dialogue. Among other things, the Draft Strategy
called for a national review of the relative roles of hazardous waste combustion and source reduction in hazardous
waste management. 
Since release of the Draft Strategy, the Agency has pursued a wide variety of activities. For example, EPA released
in May 1994 a draft technical report entitled ``Combustion Emissions Technical Resource Document''. This report
provides EPA's preliminary technical analysis of best operating practices and achievable emission levels with
regards to emissions of dioxin and particulate matter from existing hazardous waste incinerators, and boilers and
industrial furnaces (BIFs) burning hazardous wastes, based on data already submitted to EPA. The report was also
released to provide for early pre-proposal dialogue on the types of additional controls and emission limits that
should be adopted for hazardous waste combustion units. In another action, the Agency announced its proposed permitting
and public participation rule. This rule would amend EPA's RCRA regulations to provide earlier and more effective
opportunities for public participation in the RCRA permitting process. The rule also proposes tighter standards
for the interim period immediately after a facility trial burn is completed but before a final permit determination
is made. 
Today's rule provides the Agency with another opportunity to address the objectives of the Draft Strategy. In particular,
this rule specifies a series of new treatment standards that must be met before hazardous wastes are land disposed.
As in previous LDR rules, the standards for hazardous organic constituents are, in many cases, based on the performance
of combustion technology. In the proposed rule, the Agency solicited comments and data on whether other treatment
technologies, especially recycling technologies, can achieve these or comparable treatment levels. EPA also solicited
comment on whether the levels should be modified so as to allow and encourage the use of non-combustion treatment technologies.

It remains EPA's primary objective in hazardous waste management to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that is generated
so as to minimize the need to treat and dispose of hazardous waste. A wide range of waste minimization activities are
underway, including development of the National Plan for Hazardous Waste Minimization released in draft on May 23,
1994 as part of the Draft Strategy. However, for those hazardous wastes that are still produced and are disposed, the
waste must be treated (see RCRA section 3004(m)). 
While the Agency has concerns with combustion devices that are not properly designed and operated, particularly
if they do not fully control toxic metals and organics (including products of incomplete combustion (PICs)), the
Agency also believes that combustion technologies, if properly designed and operated, do minimize threats to human
health and the environment for many waste streams. Several commenters agree with the Agency on this point. In fact,
these commenters (including environmental groups) argue that relaxing the treatment standards to reduce the amount
of treatment otherwise achieved via combustion could actually increase threats to human health and the environment,
and thus violate EPA's statutory requirements under 3004(m). In addition, it has also been argued that loosening
the treatment standards will not necessarily result in less combustion because the regulated community may still
choose to rely on combustion to meet the standards. Commenters also suggested that loosening the treatment standards
will actually act as a disincentive to seek pollution prevention alternatives. This latter point seems to have merit
in that based on some preliminary analysis of the land disposal restrictions program by the Agency, the existing treatment
standards have raised the cost of hazardous waste management substantially and have been a factor in reducing the
amount of hazardous waste generated. 
To address those combustion facilities that are not operated properly, the Agency will continue its aggressive inspection
and enforcement program to bring the facilities back into compliance with all requirements and to impose penalties.
In addition, the Agency is actively engaged with all interested parties in discussions on upgrading combustion regulations.
EPA is considering, as part of this upcoming rulemaking, revising the controls on dioxin and furan emissions, particulate
matter, and toxic metals. In the course of the rulemaking, the public will have the opportunity to comment on the Agency's
proposals. As noted earlier, EPA is already seeking public comment on its preparatory work for this rulemaking to
upgrade combustion regulations through release of the Combustion Emissions Technical Resource Document, this
past May. 
Several commenters indicated that the LDR treatment standards should not be based on combustion performance because
this will encourage combustion over other treatment alternatives. Although the Agency is willing to look at alternative
technologies, such technologies must still achieve levels of performance that satisfy the dictates of RCRA section
3004(m). Also, we must have some assurance that any alternative treatment method is done safely. No information or
data was provided by these commenters on the issues of the effectiveness or safety of the alternative treatment technologies
or limits, or that such alternatives would be equally or more protective of human health and the environment. (As EPA
has stated many times, the Agency specifies concentration levels as the treatment standards rather than mandated
methods of treatment because this provides maximum flexibility in the selection of treatment technology that may
be used.)

Several commenters also asserted that only combustion technologies can achieve the levels specified as treatment
standards for organics. However, no treatability data were provided to support their general assertions. On the
other hand, limited data were provided on specific alternative treatment technologies that can also achieve the
treatment standards in today's rule. Therefore, the Agency is not convinced that the treatment standards for organics
in today's rule require modification to be achievable by technologies other than combustion, and such other technologies
may be used to meet these standards. 


D. Relationship of LDR Treatment Standards to Risk-based Treatment Standards 


The principal objection to the proposed UTS was that the values do not reflect risk, that is, the standards are based
on performance of a treatment technology rather than on assessment of risks to human health and the environment posed
by the waste. The debate over technology- versus risk-based treatment standards has continued throughout the development
of the land disposal restrictions. EPA's ultimate policy preference is to establish risk-based levels that truly
minimize threats to both human health and the environment. 55 FR at 6641 (Feb. 26, 1990). Such standards would cap the
extent of hazardous waste treatment. RCRA section 3004(m)(1). The difficulties involved in this task, however,
are formidable and very controversial. The technical issues include assessing exposure pathways other than migration
to groundwater, taking environmental risk into account, and developing adequate toxicological information for
the hazardous constituents controlled by the hazardous waste program. 
The Agency is currently working on a rulemaking that will define hazardous constituent concentration levels below
which a waste is no longer designated under RCRA subtitle C as ``hazardous.'' Discussions concerning these levels
are taking place in the Federal Advisory Committee on the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR). The HWIR Committee
is discussing issues and providing recommendations for two rulemakings: as-generated waste and contaminated media.

The HWIR Committee is made up of industry, environmentalists, treaters and disposers, and state implementing officials.
The HWIR Committee has begun discussions by focusing on concentrations below which waste mixtures and treatment
residuals would no longer be subject to the hazardous waste regulations (``exit criteria''), while also discussing
whether there is a regulatory approach to bring under regulation clearly hazardous waste not now controlled by the
hazardous waste regulations (an ``entry'' rule). In addition, EPA is working with the Committee to consider whether
risk-based exit criteria or other risk-based values based on the same exposure modeling could also serve as minimize
threat levels to potentially cap treatment standards for the land disposal restrictions. 
In Hazardous Waste Treatment Council 

v. 

EPA, 

886 F. 2d 355 (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. denied 111 S. Ct 139 (1990), the court held that the statute can be read to allow either
technology-based or risk-based standards, and further held that technology-based standards are permissible so
long as they are not established ``beyond the point at which there is no `threat' to human health or the environment.''


Id. 

at 362. The court further held that the particular technology-based standards at issue were not established below
this ``minimize threat'' level, notwithstanding that (in some cases) the standards were below Maximum Contaminant
Levels used for drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and were below the RCRA characteristic level. 

Id. 

at 361-62. In the court's view, the RCRA section 3004(m) minimize threat standard was more stringent than that
used to establish either drinking water standards or characteristic levels. EPA finds, for purposes of this rule,
that none of the treatment standards are established below levels at which threats to human health and the environment
are minimized. This finding stems from the Agency's inability at the present time, as explained above, to establish
concentration levels for hazardous constituents which represent levels at which threats to human health and the
environment are minimized. Unless the Agency determines risk-based concentration levels that achieve the ``minimized
threat'' requirement for a particular wastestream, the Agency believes that BDAT treatment (as reflected by the
UTS levels) fulfills the statutory charge. 


E. Treatment Standards for Hazardous Soil 


As stated in the September 14, 1993 proposal (58 FR 48124), EPA recognizes that the treatment standards promulgated
for as-generated hazardous waste may not always be achievable or appropriate for soil contaminated with that waste.
EPA therefore proposed less stringent alternative treatment standards that would specifically apply to hazardous
soils. In addition, EPA proposed to codify the ``contained-in'' policy for contaminated media (see 58 FR 48127).
Subsequent to the proposal, the Agency received a number of comments from the varied constituencies (industry, environmental,
waste treatment and state) involved in the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) effort for addressing contaminated
media, urging the Agency to await the results of that effort before developing soil-specific treatment standards.
Thus, EPA has decided not to promulgate alternative treatment standards for hazardous soil and the codification
of the contained-in policy as part of this rulemaking, but rather will address it as part of the HWIR effort for contaminated
media. EPA announced this decision on November 12, 1993 (see 58 FR 59976) and again on March 8, 1994 (see 59 FR 10778).

The Hazardous Waste Identification Rule for Contaminated Media, which is being developed by EPA in concert with the
States and with affected stakeholders, is intended to create a comprehensive regulatory framework within RCRA Subtitle
C that will apply to the management of contaminated media that are managed as part of remediation activities. Through
the public dialogue process, a conceptual framework has been developed for HWIR for media. As currently envisioned,
the HWIR media rule will establish mandatory treatment requirements for soils (and possibly other media) that are
highly contaminated, while less contaminated soils would be subject to management requirements of the overseeing
regulatory agency. The HWIR media rule is expected to encourage national consistency in the management of higher
risk media, while providing management flexibility for a significant volume of lower risk contaminated media, thereby
facilitating more timely and less costly cleanups.

<TEXT>
 

Although the HWIR rule for contaminated media is being 
developed on a different schedule than the LDR rules, EPA 
believes (and is supported by many commenters) that it is 
appropriate to address the issue of setting treatment standards 
for soils within the broader framework of the HWIR rule, since 
such treatment requirements are expected to be an integral part 
of that rule. In addition, EPA believes that the contained-in 
policy is one of the key issues that must be addressed in the 
development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for management of contaminated media. 
In the meantime, hazardous soils are generally subject to 
the LDR treatment standards that apply to the hazardous wastes 
with which the soils are contaminated, including those addressed 
in today's rule. 
The Agency has stated a presumption, however, that the 
treatment standards for as-generated wastes are generally 
inappropriate or unachievable for soils contaminated with 
hazardous wastes, within the meaning of 40 CFR 268.44(a) (see 55 
FR 8759-60, March 8, 1990). It has been the Agency's experience 
that contaminated soils are significantly different in their 
treatability characteristics from the wastes that have been 
evaluated in establishing the BDAT standards, and thus, will 
generally qualify for a treatability variance under 40 CFR 268.44. For guidance on treatability variances for soils,
see the 
EPA Fact Sheet entitled ``Regional Guide: Issuing Site-Specific 
Treatability Variances for Contaminated Soils and Debris from 
Land Disposal Restrictions (OSWER Publication 9839.3-08FS). For 
RCRA actions, the Regional Administrator was delegated the 
authority to deny or grant these variances in a non-rulemaking 
procedure under 40 CFR 268.44(h) on April 22, 1991. These 
variances may be granted by State agencies in States authorized 
for  268.44. Variance authority for CERCLA actions is discussed 
in LDR Guides 6A (revised Sept. 1990) and 6B (OSWER 9347.3-06FS 
and 9347.3-06BFS). 
As previously noted, EPA chose not to develop separate 
treatment standards for soils in this rulemaking, and currently 
plans to address treatment standards for contaminated soils in 
the context of the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) for 
contaminated media, which is currently under development. If, 
however, the HWIR Contaminated Media rule does not sufficiently 
address treatment standards for contaminated soils in a timely 
manner, the Agency may promulgate such standards in a separate 
rulemaking. Information on the HWIR Contaminated Media rule may 
be obtained by contacting Carolyn Loomis, at (703) 308-8626. 
Until LDR standards specific to soils are promulgated, EPA 
believes that treatability variances will generally be 
appropriate when hazardous soils are managed as part of site 
remediation activities. The Agency recognizes, however, that in 
some cases obtaining a treatability variance as provided under 
 268.44 could cause delays in implementing remedial actions. The 
Agency is currently considering whether changes to the existing 
variance or authorization procedures should be made as a means of 
expediting cleanup actions that are conducted under RCRA or other 
Federal or State authorities, or other cleanups initiated by 
responsible parties. Such changes, if necessary, will be 
addressed in a future rulemaking. 


II. Summary of Rule 


A. Treatment Standards for Newly Identified Organic Toxicity 
Characteristic (TC) Wastes 


On March 29, 1990, EPA promulgated a rule that identified 
organic constituents (in addition to existing EP metals and 
pesticide constituents) and levels at which a waste is considered 
hazardous based on the characteristic of toxicity (55 FR 11798). 
Because these wastes were identified as hazardous after the 
enactment date of HSWA in 1984, they are ``newly identified 
wastes'' for purposes of the LDR program. Included are wastes 
identified with the codes D018 through D043 based on the toxicity 
characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), i.e., TC wastes. EPA 
is establishing treatment standards for each of these 
constituents if they are managed in systems other than those 
regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), those engaging in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal, and
those injected 
into Class I deep injection wells regulated under the Safe 
Drinking Water Act (SDWA). (For an explanation of these 
qualifications, see the May 24, 1993 Interim Final Rule (58 FR 
29860).) In addition, because wastes exhibiting the toxicity 
characteristic (TC) can contain treatable levels of other 
hazardous constituents, EPA is establishing treatment standards 
for the underlying hazardous constituents, as defined in 
268.2(i). These rules are consistent with the court's opinion in 


Chemical Waste Management

 v.

 EPA,

 976 F.2d 2, 17-8 (D.C. Cir. 
1992), cert. denied 113 U.S. 1961 (1993), which held that all 
hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes must meet the 
levels of performance satisfying the requirements in RCRA 3004(m) 
before land disposal, and that treatment standards cannot be 
achieved by dilution (provided, of course, that treatment 
standards are not established below the level at which threats to 
human health and the environment are minimized). 


B. Prohibition of Dilution of High TOC Ignitable and of TC 
Pesticide Wastes Injected Into Class I Deep Wells 


In its ruling on the Third Third LDR Rule, the D.C. Circuit 
Court of Appeals remanded the portion of the Agency's rule 
allowing treatment standards for characteristic wastes to be 
achieved by dilution. The Agency is continuing to develop a 
regulatory response to implement the court's ruling. As part of 
that response, EPA is today requiring that hazardous constituents 
in two types of characteristic wastes, high total organic carbon 
(TOC) ignitable liquids (D001), and halogenated pesticide wastes 
that exhibit the toxicity characteristic (D012-D017), be fully 
treated before those wastes are disposed unless the wastes are 
disposed in an injection well that has a no-migration variance. 
The Agency believes that treatment of these particular 
wastestreams is warranted. (See Section VIII_Deep Well 
Injection Issues for further discussion.) The D001 wastes are 
ignitable with potentially high concentrations of hazardous 
constituents, and the pesticide wastes contain particularly toxic 
constituents. Further, the organics in D001 high TOC liquids can 
be recovered, destroyed, or used as a fuel and occur in only 
small volumes so that segregation and treatment should not prove 
difficult. 


C. Treatment Standards for Newly Listed Wastes 


EPA has promulgated a number of hazardous waste listings 
since the enactment of HSWA in 1984, referred to as ``newly listed 
wastes'' under the LDR program. This rule describes the treatment 
technologies (recycling is a type of treatment) identified as 
BDAT for several of these newly listed wastes, and establishes 
treatment standards based on these BDATs. Newly listed wastes 
included in today's rule are K141-K145, K147-K148, and K149-K151 (coke by-product production
wastes and chlorotoluene wastes) 
(see 40 CFR 261.32 for a description of these wastes).

D. Universal Treatment Standards 


Today's rule promulgates universal treatment standards (UTS) 
for organic, metal, and cyanide constituents_one set for 
wastewaters and a different set for nonwastewaters_that replace 
existing treatment standards for hazardous wastes. (``Replace'' is 
something of a misnomer, as explained more fully below, since 
many of the standards actually remain at current levels, and the 
rule does not require treatment of hazardous constituents not 
already regulated under current standards.) Currently, 
facilities managing hazardous wastes must meet LDR treatment 
standards established for many different listed and 
characteristic hazardous waste codes before the waste may be land 
disposed. In some cases, a constituent regulated under the 
treatment standard for one waste was also regulated in another 
waste at different concentration levels. Today's rulemaking 
eliminates these differences in concentration limits for the same 
constituent to provide a better assessment of treatability, 
reduce confusion, and ease compliance and enforcement. 
Promulgation of UTS does 

not

 change the constituents of concern 
regulated in listed wastes_that is, if only cadmium, lead and 
chromium have been regulated in a listed waste, only cadmium, 
lead and chromium are subject to regulation now that UTS are 
promulgated. However, the concentration levels for cadmium, 
lead and chromium now are numerically identical with UTS for 
those constituents. 


E. Modifications to Hazardous Waste Recycling Regulations 


The Agency is modifying the regulatory framework to the 
definition of solid waste to allow environmentally beneficial 
recycling operations to continue without the regulatory 
impediments imposed by full RCRA Subtitle C requirements. In 
turn, this will allow EPA and the states to streamline their 
efforts and better focus on operations that are part of the 
nation's waste disposal problem, rather than on those that are 
not, while the Agency continues to look at the overall 
definition. 
These modifications will broaden the 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii) 
``closed-loop'' recycling exclusion from the definition of solid 
waste such that the residues of a secondary process are excluded 
from being a solid waste if they are reinserted into the process 
without prior reclamation (and also similarly broaden the related 
40 CFR 260.30(b) variance for materials that are reclaimed prior 
to reinsertion). These provisions will put secondary recovery 
operations that recycle residues which they generated on the same 
regulatory footing as primary recovery operations. The 
modifications are based, in part, on two Court opinions (

American 
Petroleum Institute

 v. 

 EPA,

 906 F.2d 726 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (

API

) and 

American Mining Congress

 v. 

 EPA,

 907 F. 2d 1179 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (

AMC II

)) which indicate that the Agency has some 
discretion to consider the manner in which a secondary material 
is managed in determining RCRA jurisdiction (i.e., RCRA 
jurisdiction may be determined, at least in part, by 
consideration of whether the material is part of the waste 
management problem, as indicated by the potential for the 
material to pose a hazard to human health and the environment 
when recycled). 


III. Improvements to the Existing Land Disposal Restrictions 
Program 


A. Background 


``Our goal is to make the entire federal government both less 
expensive and more efficient . . . we intend to redesign, to 
reinvent, to reinvigorate the entire national government.''



President Bill Clinton 
Remarks Announcing the National 
Performance Review, March 3, 1993

 

``We are searching for ways to change_to work better and 
smarter so that the Agency can deliver high quality results at a 
reduced cost. Our aim is to treat citizens as customers, improve 
the service and delivery of our programs, and eliminate waste and 
inefficiency.''



From ``Creating A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that Works 
Better And Costs Less'' (EPA's National Performance Review Phase I Report)



In the past several years, the EPA has embarked on major 
efforts to improve the quality of its work in protecting human 
health and the environment. Coincident with this emphasis on 
improvement in the way its work is done, the Agency is striving 
to help reinvent government, in part by streamlining its 
organization and its work in order to be more efficient and save 
public resources. In that spirit, a major part of today's rule 
is designed to improve the quality and efficiency in the Land 
Disposal Restrictions Program. The measures promulgated today to 
improve the Program received widespread support from commenters 
when they were proposed.

The universal treatment standards, described in detail in 
the next section, greatly simplify both compliance and 
enforcement with the LDRs, without sacrificing protection of the 
environment or human health. In particular, the rule replaces 
the myriad constituent concentration levels in the LDR treatment 
standards for most hazardous wastes with a uniform set of 
constituent levels. Thus, the treatment standard concentration 
for a constituent in waste A will be the same concentration as 
for that constituent in waste B. As a result, hazardous waste 
generators and treaters should be able to save money and effort 
in treating hazardous wastes. These facilities will be able to 
operate more efficiently by consolidating treatment activities. 
One facility, for example, estimated an annual savings of 
$750,000 from not having to campaign treat their wastes with 
varying limits. The consistency provided by universal treatment 
standards will make it easier to comply with the LDRs. Likewise, 
the universal treatment standards will make the job of 
enforcement easier for state governments. With universal 
treatment standards in place, it will also be easier and quicker 
for EPA to set standards for hazardous wastes identified in the 
future (assuming those standards are feasible and appropriate for 
newly identified and listed wastes). The end result for the 
regulated community, states, and the EPA will be to save 
resources for other pressing tasks. 
While establishment of universal treatment standards is the 
primary improvement, other improvements are also included in 
today's rule. In particular, the Agency is: 
 Consolidating three separate tables containing treatment 
standards into a single consolidated table; 
 Reducing the information required on notification forms; 
 Simplifying the regulations for treatment of lab packs; 
 Providing easy-to-read flowcharts and a simple guide to 
paperwork requirements in order to make the rule's 
requirements clearer and easier to implement. 
Although today's rule takes significant steps in improving 
the Land Disposal Restrictions program, the Agency recognizes 
that further, in fact continuing, improvement is necessary. Some 
of the universal treatment standards (such as cyanide) will need 
to be reassessed upon completion of Agency efforts to improve the 
analytic test method. HWIR will need to be integrated into the 
Land Disposal Restrictions. The Agency is also on a firm track 
of pursuing other avenues for continuous quality improvement in 
the program. Ideas and suggestions for improvements have, and 
will, come from: (1) Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking 
published by EPA in order to acquire as much information as 
possible from the public about treatment options; (2) 
communications between EPA and its customers representing 
environmental groups, generators, and treaters; and, (3) the LDR 
Program evaluation that is currently being conducted, which was 
initiated by a public roundtable discussion with a large number of customers. Consequently, the Agency will continue
to take 
advantage of opportunities to streamline and improve the LDR 
program. 


B. Universal Treatment Standards 


The EPA is promulgating a single universal treatment 
standard (UTS) for each constituent in nonwastewater form and a 
single UTS for each constituent in wastewater form, regardless of 
the hazardous waste containing the constituent. 


1. Identification of Wastes to Which Universal Treatment 
Standards Apply 


The universal treatment standards apply to all listed and 
characteristic wastes for which treatment standards have been 
promulgated, with two exceptions. The first exception is the TC 
metal wastes (D004-D011). These metal wastes will be addressed 
in the future Phase IV LDR rule. (It should be noted that the 
mineral processing wastes which were formerly excluded from RCRA 
Subtitle C regulation under the Bevill Amendment are considered 
to be newly identified and will also be addressed in Phase IV.) 
The second exception is those for which the treatment standard is 
a specified method of treatment. Most of these wastes must 
continue to be treated using those required technologies. For a 
small number of wastes with previously specified methods of 
treatment, the universal standards are an alternative, i.e. 
either use of the specified method or the universal standard will satisfy the LDR requirement. For those few situations
where a 
mixture of wastes may be subject to different standards for the 
same constituent, the more stringent standard continues to apply. 
See  268.41(b). 
Although the proposed rule excluded F024 from the UTS, EPA 
is applying UTS to F024 in today's rule. The existing standards, 
which were unique among standards set for F- or K-listed wastes, 
incorporated numerical treatment standards and also mandated a 
specific technology_incineration. The original F024 numerical 
standards for metals were also exceptionally low, reflecting the 
fact that F024 contains only low levels of metals. 
However, comments from Dow Freeport indicated that the low 
F024 metal limit needlessly prevented them from co-treating 
wastes, a process that could save the facility $750,000/year, and 
that application of UTS solved this problem without diminishing 
the extent of treatment. EPA agrees, and is applying UTS to F024 
in this rule while continuing to require incineration. 
UTS apply to underlying hazardous constituents in 
characteristic wastes that are subject to LDRs. Apparent 
confusion in several comments leads the Agency to clarify that 
UTS will apply to the F039 waste code, the code for multi-source 
leachate. EPA used the F039 levels in the May 1993 Interim Final 
Rule as treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents 
in certain decharacterized D001 and D002 wastes (58 FR 29885). 
Consequently, UTS levels and F039 standards are identical, with 
the exception of those few constituents regulated in F039 but not 
in UTS. This means that the Interim Final Rule requirement that 
underlying hazardous constituents in certain D001 and D002 wastes 
meet F039 levels is now one and the same thing with the 
requirement that underlying hazardous constituents meet UTS. 
(The term ``underlying hazardous constituents'' is defined at 
268.2(i)). 


2. Differences in Universal Treatment Standards and Previous 
Treatment Standards 


In most cases (59%), UTS are the same as the previous 
treatment standards. Thirty three percent of the standards went 
up or down within a factor of ten of the original standard, while 
8% underwent larger changes (3% of the total number of UTS 
becoming significantly more stringent). The following table 
lists the differences between the UTS and previous standards.

This numerical comparison somewhat exaggerates the degree of 
change. The changes in numerical values for many of the organic 
constituents reflect adjustments in the limits of analytic 
detection. Actual treatment will consequently likely continue to 
destroy or remove organics to nondetectable levels. It also is 
important to note that even in those cases where numerical limits 
have changed, the technology basis has not. Treatment technology 
used to comply with the previous standards should also be able to 
comply with UTS. Again, because most treatment technologies 
cannot be so precisely calibrated as to achieve, for instance, 
3.5 ppm rather than 2.7 ppm, the likely result is that the same 
amount of treatment will occur. The main impact of UTS will be 
in simplifying compliance. 

EPA also notes that very few of the commenters who 
complained about treatment standards being unachievable provided 
data to support their claims. Because most of the wastes subject 
to UTS are already subject to LDR treatment requirements, there 
should be data documenting treatment performance of these wastes 
that commenters could have submitted. EPA believes, therefore, 
that the absence of substantiating data cannot be attributable to 
commenters' inability to generate treatment data. (The situation 
differs from the state of affairs at the beginning of the land 
disposal restrictions program when there was little existing 
treatment data to draw upon, because many hazardous wastes were 
being disposed untreated, and there was little time to generate 
such data.) 

For discussion of comparison between the UTS and previous 
standards for nonwastewater metal constituents, see section 
III.B.5.a. of this preamble. 


3. Universal Treatment Standards for Organic Hazardous 
Constituents 



EPA is today promulgating UTS for nonwastewater and 
wastewater forms of organic hazardous constituents, as found in 
the two tables in this section. 


a. Analyte Combinations 



Motivated by concern for analytical feasibility, EPA 
proposed that several groups or pairs of analytically similar 
organic compounds be regulated as the sum of their concentrations 
rather than as individual analytes. Commenters supported these 
proposals as a simplification of analytical procedures, 
particularly the proposed total PCB standards for arochlors. 
Thus, today's rule regulates each of these groups or pairs 
collectively by setting wastewater and nonwastewater numbers 
representing their sums rather than individual concentrations. 
Specific analytes to be regulated with one wastewater and 
nonwastewater number are: PCBs (arochlors), xylenes, 
benzo(b)fluoranthene/ benzo(k)fluoranthene and 
diphenylamine/diphenylnitrosamine. 



PCBs:

 Today's approach for PCBs is consistent with the 
regulations of other EPA offices, such as those promulgated 
pursuant to the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). This 
approach will also eliminate analytical difficulties in 
quantifying each of the individual arochlors. 

The ``Total PCB'' standards include seven arochlors that 
represent hundreds of isomers of polychlorinated biphenyls. 
Earlier LDR regulations addressed individual arochlors and 
required recognition of a gas chromatograph pattern which is 
often difficult to differentiate. Furthermore, regulation of 
individual arochlors may be difficult for wastes subject to 
degradation or treatment. EPA recommends SW-846 methods 8080 or 
8081 (which use a gas chromatograph/electron capture detector) 
for measurement of total PCBs. 



Xylenes:

 Similarly, today's rule regulates the sum of 
several xylene isomer analytes in both wastewaters and 
nonwastewaters. The three xylenes included on the BDAT list of 
hazardous constituents are ortho-, meta-, and para-xylene. Meta- 
and para-isomers co-elute in gas chromatograph analysis. Two 
methods exist in SW-846 for the measurement of total xylenes: 
8020 and 8240. Method 8020 detects xylenes using a 
photoionization detector and 8240 uses a mass spectrometer. 
Total xylenes concentration is determined from the addition of 
the ortho-xylene concentration and the meta-/para-xylene 
concentration. 



Benzo(b)fluoranthene/Benzo(k)fluoranthene and Diphenylamine/ 
Diphenylnitrosamine:

 EPA is also regulating two pairs of 
analytically problematic constituents, benzo(b)fluoranthene/ 
benzo(k)fluoranthene and diphenylamine/diphenylnitrosamine with a 
single wastewater and nonwastewater number for each pair.

b. Organics_Nonwastewaters 

i. The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's 
Rule 



EPA is promulgating UTS for organics in nonwastewaters as 
proposed with the exception of the standards for m- and p-cresols. These are the only organic constituents for which

commenters provided data supporting changes to the proposed UTS. 
Although organic nonwastewater UTS differ in some cases from the 
previously promulgated standards, the same technology basis, 
combustion, can meet the limits. In the previous standards as 
well as the UTS, the organic standards are based on a detection 
level in a combustion residue (adjusted upward by a variability 
factor accounting for analytic and process variability). Differences between UTS and previous standards reflect
a more 
consistent assessment of achievable detection levels for various 
constituents in combustion residues, and continue to be 
achievable using BDAT, combustion. Because the essential 
technical issue at the heart of these adjustments is the value of 
the detection limit, most of these changes reflect analytical artifacts rather than absolute differences in the
quantities of 
toxics available for release following land disposal. 



ii. Modifications to Universal Treatment Standards Made in 
Response to Comments 



A petroleum refiner involved in building a biological 
treatment system submitted data on organic nonwastewaters, and 
indicated their concern about the lower treatment standards for 
certain organic constituents that were proposed as UTS. The 
Agency evaluated the commenter's data and found, in some cases, 
the commenter was requesting that UTS levels be set at levels 
higher than the maximum levels in their untreated wastes. 
Furthermore, the commenter's data did not represent proper 
monitoring. The Agency was able to determine from their data, 
however, that one limit, the proposed m- and p-cresol limit, 
should be raised from 3.2 mg/kg to 5.6 mg/kg. This adjustment is 
based on other factors described below. 

The proposed UTS for m- and p-cresol was 3.2 mg/kg, which 
differed from the proposed UTS for o-cresol, which was 5.6 mg/kg. 
Today's rule promulgates 5.6 mg/kg for both o-cresol and m- and 
p-cresol. The proposed limits for cresols were based on a 
detection limit of 2 mg/kg for o-cresol and 1 mg/kg for m- and p-cresol from an incinerator ash study used to develop
nonwastewater standards in the Third Third rulemaking. The differences in detection limits occurred because EPA
used different treatment tests to set the limits for o- versus m- and 
p-cresol. Examination of the same test runs revealed that where 
o-cresol had a detection level of 2 mg/kg, the detection level 
for m- and p-cresol was also 2 mg/kg. In addition, where the 
detection level for m- and p-cresol was 1 mg/kg, the detection 
level for o-cresol was also 1 mg/kg. Upon further review of 
other data, the Agency observed that within a test, o-cresol and 
m- and p-cresols had the same detection levels. The numbers for 
o-cresol and m- plus p-cresol promulgated in today's rule were 
calculated with the same detection limit, as justified by the 
data review, and the same recovery factor. The resulting 
identical treatment standards reflect the fact that incineration 
treats both of these isomer groups to the same level, within the 
existing analytical constraints. 



iii. Use of Alternative Treatment Technologies to Combustion 



In establishing numerical treatment standards, the Agency 
allows the use of any technology (other than impermissible 
dilution) to comply with the limits. Some previous standards, 
namely those for petroleum refining wastes, were based on 
combustion as well as thermal desorption and solvent extraction. 
Under UTS, organic nonwastewater standards are based on and 
achievable by combustion. As for other technologies, EPA 
assessed whether the changes in limits disrupted commitments made 
to use these other technologies. With regard to thermal 
desorption, EPA examined comments on the proposed levels by three 

'vendors of thermal desorption units (Seaview Thermal Systems 
(STS), Separation and Recovery Systems, Inc. (SRS), and Ecova 
(formerly Waste Tech Services)), BDAT Background Development 
Documents for treatment standards applicable to petroleum wastes, 
the Marathon delisting petition, and other available literature. 

These data demonstrate the achievability of UTS by thermal 
desorption for petroleum refining wastes. This was an expected 
result, given the comments on the Phase I LDR rule which 
addressed F037 and F038 petroleum refining wastes. In these 
comments, a thermal desorption company called for limits lower 
than today's UTS limits (these data reflected lower detection 
levels, not necessarily better treatment than today's UTS). Also 
important in the use of thermal desorption are the operating 
conditions: raising the temperature, and/or the detention time 
increases the amount of hazardous organic constituents desorbed. 

As for solvent extraction, the data used for development of 
the K048-K052 treatment standards achieved UTS levels for about 
half of the demonstration runs. Operating conditions, such as 
solvent selection, solvent to waste ratios, detention time, and 
number of treatment passes significantly affect treatment 
results, and the agency believes these parameters can be adjusted 
to comply with the UTS. There may, however, be other factors 
which result in this technology not being selected, and based on 
information available to the Agency, no petroleum refining 
facilities are utilizing solvent extraction. 

EPA requested comments on the achievability of the proposed 
UTS for petroleum refining wastes when treated via noncombustion 
technologies. (See 58 FR 48106-48107.) EPA also requested 
comments on whether the industry has invested in non-combustion 
technologies, including those designated as BDAT in previous 
rules that cannot meet the UTS. In particular, EPA requested 
information on the type of treatment, performance data, and an 
explanation of why existing treatment could not be adjusted and 
operated more efficiently to comply with the UTS. EPA also 
pointed out it was willing to revise the proposed UTS, if data 
indicated that appropriate noncombustion technologies could 
achieve slightly higher levels than those proposed for UTS. 

Only one commenter, Valero, Inc., submitted comments with 
regard to a contractual agreement for the construction of a full 
scale bioslurry reactor and data from a bench scale treatability 
study. None of the other petroleum refining commenters indicated 
they had invested in noncombustion technologies. Valero, Inc., 
and two remediation companies, Retec Technologies and OHM 
Corporation, submitted data on biotreatment of organic 
constituents. They reported treatment efficiencies from 40 to 60 
percent for some PNAs and questioned whether the proposed 
treatment standards can be routinely achieved by biotreatment 
technologies. EPA does not generally consider such treatment 
efficiencies adequate for organic constituents. As indicated 
previously, facilities can use any technology other than 
impermissible dilution to comply with the treatment standards. 
If design and operating conditions can be adjusted to meet the 
limits, this could be full compliance. If not, the technology 
may still be appropriate for remediation wastes, for which 
standards are currently being revised in the development of HWIR.

c. Organics_Wastewaters 

i. The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's 
Rule 



The set of wastewater UTS proposed in September 1993 was 
virtually identical to the F039 wastewater standards promulgated 
in the Third Third Rule. Applying UTS to F- and K- listed wastes 
changes organic constituent wastewater standards in a handful of 
codes (F024, K001, K011/13/14, K015, K040, K038, K036, K037, 
K060, K099, K103/104, and U051). Commenters raised specific 
concerns with three of the organic wastewater treatment 
standards, and EPA is revising the proposed standards for two of 
the three constituents: the wastewater standard proposed for 
carbon disulfide will change from 0.014 mg/l to 3.8 mg/l, and the 
proposed wastewater universal treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane 
has been withdrawn. Changes to the treatment standards for these 
two constituents is explained in the following section. The 
third constituent was acetonitrile. Monsanto, Dupont, Cytec and 
other acrylonitrile producers, together with the Chemical 
Manufacturing Association's Acrylonitrile Group, objected to EPA 
extending the UTS to acrylonitrile production wastes K011, K013 
and K014. Their comments stated that the acetonitrile wastewater 
UTS was unachievably low in acrylonitrile wastes. The Agency is 
promulgating an acetonitrile UTS of 5.6 based on steam stripping 
performance data. This level also appears achievable by WAO (wet 
air oxidation) followed by PACT@ (a combination of powdered 
activated carbon treatment and activated sludge). 



ii. Treatment Standard Modification Made in Response to Comments 





Carbon Disulfide. 

In response to data submitted by the 
Chemical Manufacturer's Association's Carbon Disulfide Task 
Force, EPA is promulgating a treatment standard of 3.8 mg/l based 
on data submitted by several facilities which generate high 
concentrations of carbon disulfide in wastewaters. The proposed 
wastewater treatment standard (0.014 mg/l) was based on one data 
point for biological treatment. After receiving substantially 
more treatment data representative of more significant influent 
concentrations, EPA is promulgating a carbon disulfide wastewater 
number of 3.8 mg/l, based on the performance of activated sludge 
at one of the facilities generating carbon disulfide. 



1,4-Dioxane. 

Eastman Chemical reported that serious 
analytical problems, namely wide variation in detection limits, 
precluded reliable and accurate quantification of 1,4-dioxane. 
After reviewing detection limit data, EPA decided to withdraw the 
wastewater treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane pending technical 
resolution in a later rule. This decision changes the 
treatment standard for U108 (1,4-dioxane) wastewaters. Formerly 
the wastewater treatment standard was 0.12 mg/l; today's rule 
promulgates a method of treatment as a standard for U108 
wastewaters, namely wet air oxidation or chemical oxidation 
followed by carbon adsorption or incineration.

5. Universal Treatment Standards for Metal Hazardous Constituents 



EPA is promulgating UTS for both the nonwastewater and 
wastewater forms of each of the 14 BDAT list metal constituents. 
The standards are found in the table ``Universal Treatment 
Standards for Metal Constituents'' at the end of this preamble 
section. These UTS will replace the existing metal constituent 
treatment standards for all listed wastes, and will constitute 
applicable levels for underlying hazardous metal constituents in 
ignitable, corrosive and TC organic wastes. They do not apply to 
wastes exhibiting the toxicity characteristic due to metal 
constituents, i.e., waste codes D004-D012, nor do they replace 
the treatment standards promulgated in the Third Third rule for 
EP metals. Wastecodes D004-D012 will be addressed in an 
upcoming rulemaking. 



a. Nonwastewaters 



The nonwastewater UTS for 12 of the 14 metal constituents 
are based on the performance of high temperature metal recovery 
(HTMR) or stabilization. The remaining two metals are arsenic 
for which the standard is based on vitrification, and mercury, 
which standard requires recovery by roasting or retorting for 
certain highly concentrated mercury wastes. As always, when the 
Agency develops concentration-based treatment standards, the use 
of other technologies to achieve those standards is allowed. 

The following table presents a comparison of the previously 
promulgated standards with the UTS.

Commenters objected to the proposed levels and provided 
treatment data for only two metal limits, chromium and mercury. 
The Agency revised the proposed treatment standards for chromium 
and mercury as described later in this section. For the other 
UTS metal constituents the Agency promulgated standards as 
proposed. 

For four of these metals beryllium, thallium, vanadium and 
zinc, the previous standards limited the metal at one level, 
which was proposed and promulgated for UTS. 

For four other metals, antimony, cadmium, nickel and silver, 
the Agency proposed and promulgated the UTS level at the highest 
of the previous standards. This occurred based on the best data 
for the most difficult to treat wastes. Commenters did not 
submit new data supporting lower limits for these constituents. 
While the limits for some waste codes are raised, EPA considered 
the following factors: 

(1) A broader assessment of the treatment data; 

(2) Some of the low/previous metal standards simply reflected low levels in the untreated wastes; 

(3) Regulation of other metals for a waste code, namely 
those that are present in significantly high 
concentrations, will control design and operations of 
the treatment technology. 

For the remaining four metals, arsenic, barium, lead and 
selenium, the Agency did not propose or promulgate the UTS at the 
highest previous standard. Commenters did not submit data on 
these metals. The justification for rejecting lower levels are 
the same as those presented for antimony, cadmium, nickel and 
silver in the preceeding discussion. For these metals, EPA did 
not choose the highest previous standard; rather, the standard 
for the most difficult to treat waste was selected and it 
achieved a lower standard than the highest previous standard. 

In addition to the above consideration, the Agency 
considered matrix effects. In setting the nonwastewater metal 
limits, EPA has examined the most difficult to treat wastes; 
therefore, if a matrix relationship exists, other wastes should 
more easily meet the limits. If there exists a waste that can 
not meet the limits, the Agency has a treatability variance 
process to address those instances. It appears that HTMR is 
matrix independent, consistently achieving the same level of 
treatment performance as measured in the residuals, regardless of 
the influent matrix composition. With regard to matrix effects 
on stabilization, adjustments to the type and quantity of 
stabilizing agents can greatly compensate for matrix effects. 

The UTS standard for chromium (Total) was proposed to be 
0.33 mg/l in the TCLP extract based upon the K061-HTMR treatment 
standard data. One commenter (Occidental Chemical), objected to 
the proposed limits and supplied stabilization data for chromium. 
They indicated through 85 data points that they could achieve a 
level of 0.58 mg/kg. The Agency evaluated treatability data from 
various sources, including Occidental Chemical and previously 
promulgated waste codes. These evaluations compared analyses of 
performance data between untreated and treated concentrations of 
metal waste. From this treatability data the Agency selected the 
most difficult to treat waste. It was determined that the waste 
criteria selected was submitted by Cyanokem for F006 during the 
promulgation of the Third Third rule (June 1, 1990). This waste 
was a composition of stripping liquids, plating operations, 
pelletizing operations, and clean out wastes from plating tanks. 
The data sets involving the most difficult to treat waste were 
used to calculate the limit of 0.86 mg/l TCLP. The other data 
sets, including those from the comments, generally achieved the 
0.86 mg/l TCLP. The treatment results that did not meet the 
levels may be due to treatment being designed to only meet the 
characteristic levels. It is the Agency's belief that with the 
use of a more effective stabilization process, a lower level 
could be achieved, as demonstrated by the fact that a more 
difficult to treat waste attained the level of 0.86 mg/l TCLP. 
Therefore, the Agency is promulgating the treatment standard of 
0.86 mg/l TCLP. 

EPA proposed UTS for low mercury subcategory nonwastewaters 
(containing less than 260 mg/kg total mercury) at 0.009 mg/l 
TCLP. Many commenters expressed concern over this standard. EPA 
has reconsidered the proposed UTS for mercury and is promulgating 
standards as follows: 0.200 mg/l TCLP for low subcategory retort 
residues, and 0.025 mg/l TCLP for other low subcategory 
nonwastewaters. (The existing treatment standard for high 
subcategory mercury nonwastewaters (concentration greater than 
260 mg/kg) is already RMERC, i.e., recovery of mercury by 
retorting or roasting. This treatment standard is unaffected by 
today's rule.) Comments and EPA's responses are summarized 
below. 

Several commenters expressed the belief that the current 
treatment standards for K106, D009, and K071 wastes should remain 
in effect. These commenters submitted data from the analysis of 
retorted mercury waste to support the claim that the proposed UTS 
for mercury is not achievable by retorting, the recognized BDAT 
for K106 and D009 wastes. These data consisted of total and TCLP 
analyses of 109 residue samples from retorted K106 and D009 
wastes. Although 23 of these samples contained greater than 260 
mg/kg total mercury and would therefore require further 
retorting, of the remaining 86 samples, 18 contained greater than 
0.009 mg/l mercury by TCLP, the proposed UTS for mercury 
nonwastewaters. All 86 samples contained less than 0.15 mg/l 
mercury by TCLP. These data support the commenters' position 
that the proposed UTS for mercury is not achievable by properly 
operated BDAT treatment technology (e.g., RMERC). 

Further examination of available data has convinced the 
Agency that the proposed nonwastewater standard was too low. The 
basis for the proposed UTS for metal nonwastewaters, which was 
data from the treatment of K061 by high temperature metal 
recovery (HTMR), is not appropriate for mercury wastes. K061 
waste does not typically contain large quantities of mercury and 
HTMR facilities do not accept wastes containing high 
concentrations of mercury. EPA has therefore decided not to 
promulgate the proposed nonwastewater standards, and instead to 
apply the existing treatment standards for K071, K106, P065, 
P092, and U151 as the UTS for mercury nonwastewaters. This is 
appropriate, since mercury is the most significant constituent in 
these wastes, and BDAT for these wastes is particularly directed 
to treating mercury. The Agency continues to believe that the 
revised limits for mercury and 12 other metal constituents in 
K061 provide adequate assurance that BDAT will occur for K061. 
Thus, the universal treatment standards for low subcategory 
mercury wastes will be 0.20 mg/l mercury by TCLP for retort 
residue nonwastewaters, and 0.025 mg/l mercury by TCLP for other 
low subcategory nonwastewaters. 

The following table is a compilation of the final metal 
universal standards for nonwastewaters.

b. Wastewaters


The metal UTS for wastewaters are based on chemical precipitation as BDAT. Depending on the initial concentration
of metal constituents in the wastewater, operating conditions such as retention time, flocculating agents, reagent
concentrations such as iron to affect solubility of other metals, and mixing may need to be adjusted to comply with
the standards.
The following table presents the UTS metal wastewater limits, and the previous limits. Changes to the proposed metal
standards occurred in two areas: use of Office of Water Metal Finishing limits, and an adjustment of the proposed vanadium
limit. These changes are explained following the table.

In the proposal, EPA solicited comments on changing the limits for cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc
to those used in the Office of Water's Metal Finishing Effluent Guidelines. These standards represented a more comprehensive
database, addressed many more facilities, and represented the most difficult to treat waste. Although none of the
commenters submitted data, they (commenters) supported the use of the Metal Finishing standards as the UTS wastewater
treatment numbers. We are adopting the metal wastewater limits used for the Effluent Guidelines for the Metal Finishers
Point Source category for cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, silver and zinc for the reasons outlined above. 
The Agency received comments, but no data, that the proposed vanadium limit of 0.042 was unachievably low. At the proposed
level, vanadium would be the most stringent regulated metal. With little data supporting the proposed level, the
Agency tried to follow up with commenters and other sources to obtain data. Wastewater with significant vanadium
is rare, and EPA's efforts yielded limited data supporting a level of 4.3 mg/l. This level is within the range of other
metal limits, and is achievable, based on the data availability. While the Agency would have preferred having more
data for vanadium, the UTS is set at 4.3 mg/l. If the few facilities that have significant vanadium wastewaters can
not meet this limit, EPA's treatability variance process is available. Also, the Agency would be willing to reassess
this limit in a future rule, if data are submitted which supports a change in this standard. 
For all other metal wastewater UTS_antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, mercury, selenium and thallium_EPA is
promulgating limits as proposed. The data used for UTS reflect, for each of these metals, the best data available.
With the possibility of more wastewaters being treated to comply with LDR standards_particularly characteristic
wastewaters that heretofore have been decharacterized and whose underlying hazardous constituents may not have
been treated, EPA has made a determined effort in this rulemaking to base treatment standards on the best data available,
which data reflects a wide variety of wastewaters. Although the UTS are in some cases higher than existing limits,
EPA believes that these existing lower limits, in many cases, reflected low levels of metals in untreated wastes.
In addition, wastewater standards, to date, have not had direct effect on many wastes, because most hazardous wastewaters
are either treated in tanks and discharged, managed in  3005(j)(ii) impoundments, injected into Class I hazardous
deep wells which have received no-migration variances, or decharacterized, and so are not subject to these lower
standards. 
The following table is a compilation of final metal universal treatment standards for wastewaters.

6. Universal Treatment Standards for Cyanide Wastes 


For the nonwastewater forms of cyanide wastes, EPA is promulgating the UTS as proposed: 590 mg/kg (total cyanide)
and 30 mg/kg (amenable cyanide). For wastewaters, EPA is promulgating the UTS: 1.2 mg/l (total cyanide) and 0.86 mg/l
(amenable cyanide). These wastewater standards differ from those that were proposed (see section b of the cyanide
UTS discussion below). The cyanide wastewater and nonwastewater UTS are based on the treatment of wastewaters via
alkaline chlorination.
EPA is also codifying in 40 CFR 268.40 that compliance with the cyanide nonwastewater UTS requires the use of EPA SW-846,
Test Methods 9010 and 9012, along with a specified sample size of 10 grams, and a distillation time of 75 minutes. Most
commenters, in particular those from the hazardous waste treatment industry, welcomed and supported this part of
EPA's proposal. These kind of provisions eliminate variabilities that can result from the analyses of different
sample sizes and distillation times. A detailed discussion of these treatment standards follows. 


a. Cyanide Nonwastewaters 


EPA proposed three options for cyanide in nonwastewater forms (a standard based on total and amenable cyanide concentrations,
a standard based on TCLP concentrations, and a standard that specifies treatment methods) at 58 FR 48104. EPA is promulgating
the first option.

EPA is discussing in this preamble only the major comments on the first option. Please see the Response to Comments
Document in the docket for this rule for EPA's responses to all the comments received on the proposed three options.

EPA requested comments on its rationale for setting a common cyanide UTS for all nonwastewater forms of cyanide. Two
primary issues were emphasized in the proposal: (1) the establishment of a cyanide UTS that is less stringent for wastes
that contain little to no cyanide; and, (2) standardized sample size and distillation time for compliance monitoring.

EPA believes that by basing a universal treatment on the cyanide matrix that is most difficult to treat, the universal
treatment standard will indeed be uniformly achievable. EPA has determined that electroplating wastes with high
concentrations of iron represent the most difficult to treat of all the cyanide wastes. The available performance
data for treating electroplating wastes support the establishment of a UTS of 590 mg/kg (total cyanide) and 30 mg/kg
(amenable cyanide). 
EPA noted that although other cyanide wastes were required to meet lower treatment standards, the establishment
of this higher UTS was not likely to discourage effective treatment of these other wastes. Examples of the other wastes
of concern include multi-source leachate, pigments, petroleum, coking, ink solvents and organo-nitrogen wastes.
These wastes generally have very little cyanide in the untreated waste, have cyanide along with organic constituents
which are routinely incinerated, or have cyanide in a free form which is easier to treat by conventional treatment
methods (alkaline chlorination). Because these wastes are routinely treated by incineration or a cyanide destruction
technology, EPA believes further subcategorization of the cyanide UTS standard is not warranted at this time. (Put
another way, the Agency does not believe as a practical matter that more cyanide will be land disposed as a result of
UTS, and therefore that the interest in simplified standards warrants against further subcategorization of cyanide
wastes.) 
The majority of the commenters supported EPA's proposed rationale for developing a cyanide UTS and believe EPA's
proposed approach is appropriate for setting UTS. Two commenters, however, urged EPA to withdraw the proposed UTS
and to promulgate instead a lower cyanide UTS, as described below. 
The first commenter believes that EPA should set two categories of cyanide UTS: (1) organic, which would include all
those cyanide wastes with regulated organics; and, (2) inorganic, which include all cyanide wastes with regulated
metals. For organics, they suggested a UTS of 30 mg/kg (total cyanide) and 1.8 mg/kg (amenable cyanide). For inorganics,
the commenter suggested a UTS of 400 mg/kg (total cyanide) based on rejecting three data points used to calculate the
590 mg/kg limits. 
The other commenter believes that it is inappropriate for EPA to raise the standards for all nonwastewater forms of
cyanide wastes. They said that existing treatment technologies can treat cyanide wastes to levels below the proposed
UTS, and they asked EPA to promulgate lower cyanide levels such as those promulgated for nonwastewater forms of F011
and F012. 
EPA is not persuaded by these comments. First, a separate lower treatment standard for cyanide in organic wastes is
currently unnecessary because combustion of these wastes to comply with organic treatment standards effectively
destroys cyanides. Second, EPA believes that the three data points queried in CyanoKem's comment are in fact representative.
None of these three data points fail a statistical Outlier test. Furthermore, the description of the design and operating
conditions make it appear that treatment was conducted properly. Third, the limit for F011 and F012 (which had a treatment
standard for cyanide below the UTS) has not been previously subject to the 1 hour and 15 minute distillation time and
10 gram sample requirements, which can greatly influence results and are required conditions for the UTS. 
CyanoKem's comment, in fact, amounts to a request that EPA reopen the technology basis for the cyanide standard, an
issue not opened for public comment. The treatment standards for cyanide are based on performance of alkaline chlorination
technology. 54 FR at 26610-611 (June 23, 1989). CyanoKem has upgraded that technology with certain proprietary
modifications. 56 FR at 12355 (March 25, 1991). EPA has already indicated that this adapted technology is not, and
need not serve as the basis for the treatment standard. 

Id

. 
In any case, EPA does not believe that this is an appropriate time to undertake major changes to the cyanide standards.
This is because the cyanide analytic method, although improved by the changes in this rule which are the best available
at the present time, continues to have shortcomings. EPA is working to develop a different analytic method. It may
be that after the new method is developed, further investigation of cyanide standards will be warranted.

b. Cyanide Wastewaters 



EPA is promulgating 1.2 mg/l (total cyanide) and 0.86 mg/l 
(amenable cyanide) as UTS for wastewater forms of cyanide wastes. 
In the proposed rule, EPA pointed out that a total cyanide 
concentration of 1.9 mg/l, regardless of process waste type, is 
widely used in wastewater discharge regulations_namely those 
for the Metal Finishing Industry and the Organic Chemicals, 
Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) Industry; however, the 
concentration of 1.9 mg/l was a typographical error. The Agency 
intended to propose a concentration 1.2 mg/l of total cyanide. 
(The 1.2 mg/l level is supported by EPA's OCPSF regulations and 
the background information in the record to the proposed rule 
supporting the proposed total cyanide UTS applicable to cyanide 
wastewaters.) The majority of commenters from the pharmaceutical 
and waste treatment industry commented on the proposed UTS 
cyanide for wastewaters assuming a standard of 1.2 mg/l total 
cyanide level was proposed. 

Commenters pointed out that the proposed level of 1.2 mg/l 
(total cyanide) is not always applied to OCPSF discharges. EPA 
has authorized permit writers or control authorities to exempt a 
source from OCPSF's total cyanide (discharge) limit, and to 
establish a Best Professional Judgement (``BPJ'') amenable cyanide 
limit. The BPJ limit must be based on a determination that the 
cyanide limits are not achievable due to elevated levels of non- 
amenable cyanide that result from the unavoidable complexing of 
cyanide at the process source (40 CFR 414.11(g), 414.91, and 
414.101). As with the CWA regulations, EPA provides facilities 
with a RCRA treatability variance process in the 40 CFR 268.44 
regulations that would allow a facility to achieve an alternate 
treatment standard (see discussion of treatability variance at 
section XII of this preamble). EPA believes that this provision 
provides a mechanism for establishing an alternative cyanide 
limit for OCPSF facilities in appropriate cases. 

These commenters also reported that CWA regulations for the 
Pharmaceutical Industry specify cyanide limitations as high as 
33.5 mg/l total cyanide. EPA looked into these concerns; in 
particular, whether the proposed standard of 1.2 mg/l can be 
achieved universally. Treatment performance data, however, were 
not submitted by the commenters. Contrary to the commenters' 
arguments, the literature and the performance data on cyanide 
treatment clearly show that cyanide wastewaters are treatable to 
1.2 mg/l total cyanide. While the CWA cyanide limit is 33.5 mg/l 
for the pharmaceutical industry, that limit was established in 
1983 and is currently being investigated for possible revision. 
Data were obtained from these ongoing efforts, confirming that 
pharmaceutical wastes can achieve the 1.2 mg/l cyanide level. 

Other commenters emphasized that because EPA's proposed 
universal wastewater standard of 1.2 mg/l total CN could not be 
routinely met by cyanide destruction technologies available at 
their site, EPA should only set a treatment level of 0.86 mg/l 
(amenable cyanide). Another commenter added that in the Third 
Third rule (see 55 FR 22550-22553, June 1, 1990), EPA already set 
a level of 0.86 mg/l for amenable cyanide in characteristic 
wastewaters which is routinely met by their modified wastewater 
treatment system. The proposed UTS treatment standard of 0.86 
mg/l (amenable cyanide) is based on the treatment of complex-iron 
wastewaters from the electroplating industry by alkaline 
chlorination (a cyanide destruction technology, and BDAT). The 
commenter urged EPA to set this level as the sole cyanide UTS. 

In the first place, the Agency views the issue of requiring 
treatment for both total and amenable CN to be settled in past 
rules, and did not intend to reopen it. See 54 FR at 26609 (June 
23, 1989). If further response is deemed necessary, EPA remains 
unpersuaded by these arguments. Clean Water Act effluent 
limitations could technically be met by adding ferro-sulfate or 
other sulfate reagents to wastewaters. These chemical reagents 
do not destroy cyanides in the effluent wastewater but instead, 
they leave behind iron-cyanide complexes or thiocyanates. By 
requiring compliance for both amenable and total cyanide, 
facilities must pursue treatment practices that can effectively 
destroy cyanides. EPA is thus promulgating 1.2 mg/l (total 
cyanide) and 0.86 mg/l (amenable cyanide) as UTS for wastewater 
forms of cyanide wastes. 

EPA had previously reserved the treatment standard for total 
cyanide in wastewater forms of D003 reactive cyanide wastes. In 
today's rule, EPA is applying the UTS of 1.2 mg/l to this waste. 
EPA sees no reason that the limit is not generally achievable, 
and commenters supplied no reasons.

C. Consolidation of Equivalent Technology-Specific Combustion Standards



Another improvement to the existing Land Disposal 
Restrictions program that is being made in today's rule is the 
simplification of two equivalent technology-specific combustion 
standards in: Table 1_Technology Codes and Description of 
Technology-Based Standards in 40 CFR 268.42. The Agency is 
consolidating the descriptions of INCIN (incineration) and FSUBS 
(fuel substitution), by combining them into one term, CMBST 
(combustion). The definition of CMBST, as stated in  268.42 
Table 1, is: ``combustion in incinerators, boilers, or 
industrial furnaces operated in accordance with the applicable 
requirements of 40 CFR part 264 subpart O, and part 266, subpart 
H.'' (Because the Part 265 interim status standards for 
incinerators are largely nonsubstantive, EPA does not view 
facilities operating pursuant to these standards to be performing 
BDAT treatment. This is not true of boilers and industrial 
furnaces, where the interim status standards are nearly as 
stringent as those for permitted units.) 

This definition includes a specific reference to boilers and 
industrial furnaces in order to clarify that combustion in these 
units is (and always has been) allowed as a means of complying 
with FSUBS. The Agency is also clarifying that any future 
regulations, such as potential emission limits on metals or 
halogenated organic content, established in part 264 subpart O, 
and part 266 subpart H, shall also apply automatically to the 
standard of CMBST (or INCIN) in part 268. The consolidation of 
INCIN with FSUBS to read CMBST does not represent any change to 
the promulgated standards and additional notice and comment was, 
therefore, not required. 

All of the K-, U-, and P-listed wastes that have 
technology-specific standards contain chemicals that are very 
difficult to quantify in treatment residues. The chemicals 
representing the waste codes for which the Agency has promulgated 
CMBST as a standard are, for the most part, thermally labile and 
are expected to be destroyed relatively easily in any type of 
combustion unit. EPA originally set up the two separate 
standards of INCIN and FSUBS (Final Rule for Third Third Wastes, 
June 1, 1990), because the Agency did not have in place the 
operating requirements for boilers and industrial furnaces (i.e., 
the requirements for FSUBS). See 52 FR at 17021 (May 6, 1987). 
Because these requirements have been promulgated (56 FR 7134 
(February 21, 1991), both sets of standards should assure equally 
efficient combustion of hazardous waste. For the same reason, 
there is no need to distinguish between the types of units that 
are allowed to handle each specific waste code. (EPA is, 
however, actively reviewing current regulations for combustion 
units to assure the rules' protectiveness, and may propose more 
stringent standards for such units. See EPA's Draft Combustion 
Strategy of May 18, 1993). 

As a result of today's action the standards for the 
following waste codes are modified to read ``CMBST'': 





(1) Two treatment subcategories of D001 wastes 

(2) Six source-specific wastes listed in  261.32: 
K027, K039, K113, K114, K115, K116 

(3) Seventeen wastes listed in  261.33(e): 
P001, P003, P005, P009, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, 
P068, P081, P085, P088, P102, P105, P109, P112 

(4) Forty-one wastes listed in  261.33(f): 
U008, U016, U023, U053, U055, U056, U057, U058, U064, 
U085, U086, U087, U089, U090, U094, U096, U098, U099, 
U103, U109, U113, U122, U123, U124, U125, U126, U133, 
U147, U154, U160, U166, U182, U186, U197, U201, U213, 
U221, U248, U328, U353, U359 





Other technology-specific standards and/or numerical 
standards that have been promulgated for the above listed codes 
remain unchanged. In particular, the promulgated standards of 
CHRED and CHOXD (i.e., chemical reduction and chemical oxidation) 
remain unchanged as alternatives to CMBST for fourteen of the 
above U and P waste codes. These standards were established 
because the chemicals represented by these wastes hydrolyze 
relatively rapidly (i.e., react with water) and both of the 
technologies represented by these standards are typically 
performed under aqueous conditions. These waste codes include: 
P009, P068, P081, P105, P112, U023, U086, U096, U098, U099, U103, 
U109, U133, U160. 

Today's rule does not affect the existing standards for 
waste codes where INCIN was specified, but FSUBS was not. For 
those waste codes, the standard remains identified as INCIN, 
rather than CMBST. 

The Agency is further investigating potential modifications 
to the presentation in 40 CFR 268.40 of all of the technology-specific standards in order to simplify and clarify the

promulgated treatment standards, and may propose additional 
changes in the future.

D. Incorporation of Newly Listed Wastes Into Lab Packs and 
Changes to Appendices 



On June 1, 1990 (55 FR 22629), EPA promulgated alternative 
treatment standards under 40 CFR 268.42(c) for waste codes listed 
in 40 CFR 268 Appendix IV and V that are placed in lab packs. 
These alternative standards are legally constructed, in part, as 
``specified methods of treatment'' because of physical difficulties 
in measuring compliance with numerical standards for these multi-
coded waste forms (i.e., compliance is complicated by the fact 
that many lab packs are comprised of hundreds of small 
containers, each with different organic or organo-metallic 
chemicals in them, making it difficult to accurately sample 
treatment residues for those organics). In the January, 1991, 
correction notice and again in the May 30, 1991, Advance Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking (56 FR 24453), the Agency requested 
comment on potential improvements to these alternative standards. 


EPA's original intent in establishing two separate 
appendices was to distinguish between those lab packs containing 
organo-metallics (Appendix IV) and those containing only organics 
(Appendix V). As such, lab packs containing organo-metallics 
(Appendix IV) were expected to need stabilization after 
performing the specified method of treatment, INCIN (i.e., 
incineration), while Appendix V lab packs only needed to be 
incinerated. However, under 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4), all treatment 
residues of either type of lab pack also had to comply with the 
standards for the extraction procedure (EP) for metals, i.e., 
D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D010, and D011. (D009 is not 
included in this list because most mercury-bearing wastes were 
excluded from the use of the alternative standards in both of 
these Appendices.) As such, if metals were concentrated in the 
residues from the incineration of an Appendix V lab pack and the 
resultant residues then exhibited one of the characteristics for 
EP metals, these residues would also have had to be stabilized to 
comply with the appropriate treatment standard for metals. In 
such a case, there was no practical difference between Appendix 
IV and Appendix V lab packs in terms of the treatment that was 
needed. 


The majority of the comments received from the regulated 
community supported the Agency's proposed approach. In this final 
rule EPA is, therefore, replacing Appendix IV and Appendix V with 
a new Appendix IV. In order to simplify the new Appendix IV it 
only contains those wastes excluded from lab packs. The 
following wastes are excluded from lab packs (and appear in new 
Appendix IV) for the purpose of using the alternative lab pack 
treatment standard in 40 CFR 268.42(c): D009, F019, K003, K004, 
K005, K006, K062, K071, K100, K106, P010, P011, P012, P076, P078, 
U134, U151. 


In today's rule, EPA is also stating that the alternative 
treatment standard for lab packs applies to the following 
additional waste codes that were previously not included in 
Appendix IV or V: wastes for which treatment standards were 
promulgated in the LDR Phase I rule August 1, 1992 (57 FR 37194), 
and wastes (including TC organic wastes) for which treatment 
standards are promulgated in this final rule. Today's rule does 
not list these as excluded waste codes in the new Appendix IV. 


As a matter of clarification, the alternative treatment 
standard for lab packs is INCIN. This required combustion 
technology combined with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.42(c)(4) 
(ash residues are treated to meet the characteristic metals 
treatment standards), will ensure that all underlying hazardous 
constituents present in characteristic wastes (other than those 
excluded in the new Appendix IV), will be treated. The use of 
this alternative lab pack standard negates the requirement to 
monitor for, or comply with, the UTS for underlying hazardous 
organic constituents. 


For reasons outlined in the June 1, 1990 final rule, mercury 
wastes were excluded from this alternative standard for lab 
packs. Mercury is considered a ``volatile metal'' which may lead 
to excessive air emissions in some combustion devices when 
present in large quantities. Mercury is also very difficult to 
stabilize if present in ash residues in large quantities. 
Commenters did not provide any justifiable technical reason for 
EPA to modify its position with respect to mercury wastes, and 
thus these wastes shall remain excluded from this alternative lab 
pack treatment standard. 




E. Changes in the LDR Program in Response to the LDR Roundtable 




EPA convened a roundtable meeting on January 12-14, 1993 to 
discuss the LDR program. The purpose of the roundtable was for 
EPA to hear suggestions on improvements to the LDR program from 
persons who implement it. Participants included representatives 
of hazardous waste generators, treaters, and disposers; public 
interest groups; state environmental agencies; EPA regional 
offices; and other federal agencies. EPA is today promulgating 
several recommendations made by roundtable participants. The 
Agency is consolidating the three existing treatment standard 
tables into one table, and is simplifying notification 
requirements and reducing paperwork, as discussed below. In 
addition, as discussed in an earlier section of this preamble, 
the Agency is also promulgating universal treatment standards. 
Furthermore, the Agency is committed to continue to identify 
ways the LDR program can be simplified. Additional opportunities 
for such streamlining will be explored in future LDR rulemakings. 




1. Consolidated Treatment Table 




Several of the groups present at the LDR roundtable 
expressed an interest in having a consolidated treatment standard 
table in the regulations. Participants stated that the existing 
system of three separate tables at 40 CFR 268.41-268.43 was too 
complex and burdensome. In its September 14, 1993 notice, EPA 
proposed a single consolidated table of treatment standards. 
Comments on the table were favorable. 


Today, EPA is replacing the three existing treatment 
standard tables with the consolidated table, called ``Treatment 
Standards for Hazardous Waste'' and placing it at  268.40 along 
with much of the text found currently in   268.41-268.43. 
Section 268.42 continues to describe the technology codes, to 
regulate California list PCBs and HOCs, to set out exemptions 
from the required methods, and to provide procedures for 
equivalency determinations. The numerical treatment standards in 
the consolidated table are identical to the UTS promulgated in 
today's rule with the exception of characteristic metal wastes. 


Reformatting   268.40-268.43 also corrects a confusing 
aspect of the way the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has 
appeared for some time. The ``No Land Disposal'' treatment 
standards that have appeared at  268.43 will be deleted from the 
regulations and should no longer appear in the CFR. These 
treatment standards have not been in effect since 1990, when the 
LDR Third Third rule set treatment standards for these wastes 
that were expressed as either methods of treatment or numerical 
standards that now appear in the consolidated treatment standard 
table  268.40. It was only a drafting oversight that made these 
``No Land Disposal'' standards continue to appear in the 
regulations, and today's rule corrects this mistake.

2. Simplified LDR Notification Requirements 



Comments on LDR notification requirements at the roundtable 
ranged from suggestions that EPA should eliminate notifications 
altogether to suggestions that EPA modify or delete data items on 
the notification. In response, EPA proposed to eliminate the 
requirement at 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1)(ii) and at 268.9(d)(1) that the 
notification include treatment standards or references to those 
standards. It was argued that such a simplification makes 
particular sense in conjunction with EPA's proposal to 
consolidate the treatment standard tables. Commenters on this 
issue all supported this proposed simplification. EPA is thus 
dropping the treatment standard or reference to the treatment 
standard from the LDR notification in this final rule. 

Today's action does not eliminate the existing requirement 
to identify the constituents in F001-F005 spent solvent wastes, 
F039 wastes, or the underlying hazardous constituents in D001, 
D002, and in TC organic wastes, unless the generator/treater is 
going to monitor for all hazardous constituents in the waste. 
However, the regulatory language is made clearer, and there is no 
longer any requirement that the corresponding constituent level 
be included with the constituents identified on the LDR 
notification for these wastes. 


IV. Treatment Standards for Toxicity Characteristic Waste 


A. Introduction_Content and Scope 



EPA is promulgating treatment standards for the newly 
identified toxicity characteristic (TC) organic wastes (D018-
D043) as proposed. These are identical to the UTS in today's 
rule. The UTS apply to the underlying hazardous constituents in 
the TC waste as well as the individual constituent responsible 
for the TC designation. Underlying hazardous constituents are 
any constituents in  268.48 which are reasonably expected to be 
present at levels above the UTS at the point of generation of the 
TC waste. (See definition at  268.2(i).) Although the intent of 
today's regulations is to require treating all underlying 
hazardous constituents present plus the TC constituent, today's 
rule calls for generators to monitor only the TC constituent and 
those underlying hazardous constituents ``reasonably expected to 
be present'' in their waste at its point of generation. Today's 
rule is promulgating the compliance monitoring provisions that 
were proposed. Section X of this preamble (Compliance Monitoring 
and Notification) discusses them in detail. 

Several commenters suggested that EPA promulgate alternative 
standards of incineration (INCIN), fuel substitution (FSUBS) and 
recovery of organics (RORGS) for these wastes. These commenters 
pointed to the Interim Final Rule of May 24, 1993 (58 FR 29867) 
where EPA extended the use of these methods of treatment to all 
D001 wastes disposed outside CWA or CWA-equivalent impoundments 
or Safe Drinking Water Act regulated Class I underground 
injection wells. EPA is not adopting this approach in today's 
rule for TC organic wastes. First, EPA does not believe that 
methods of treatment intended to address organic constituents 
will always adequately address any underlying metal constituents 
present in these wastes. In addition, the Agency has not yet 
been able to completely evaluate the appropriateness of requiring 
specified treatment technologies for TC wastes and other wastes. 


1. Waste Management Systems Affected by Today's Rule 



In terms of waste management systems, today's rule applies 
to those TC wastes which are managed in systems other than: (1) 
wastewater treatment systems which include surface impoundments 
whose ultimate discharge is subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA); 
(2) zero dischargers who, before permanent land disposal of the 
wastewater, treat the wastewaters in a CWA-equivalent wastewater 
treatment system; or, (3) Class I underground injection wells 
subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Underground 
Injection Control (UIC) program. CWA-equivalent treatment means 
biological treatment for organics, reduction of hexavalent 
chromium, precipitation/sedimentation for metals, alkaline 
chlorination or ferrous sulfate precipitation of cyanide (to the 
extent these constituents are present in the untreated influent 
to wastewater treatment systems), or treatment that the facility 
can show performs as well or better than these enumerated 
technologies. See  268.37(a), 58 FR at 29885 (May 24, 1993). 
Organic TC wastes managed in these types of systems will be 
regulated in the next LDR rule. 

Additionally, ``decharacterizing'' the TC wastes regulated 
under this rule by rendering them noncharacteristic does not 
remove them from the scope of these regulations. 

Chemical Waste 
Management 

v.

 EPA

, 976 F. 2d at 14-15. Consequently today's 
final rule will apply to some injection practices, in particular, 
those involving Class V injection wells. These typically are 
wells injecting nonhazardous wastes above or into underground 
sources of drinking water. (If, however, the TC wastes injected 
into non-Class I wells were to be treated by CWA-equivalent means 
before injection, today's treatment standards would not apply. 
This is an example of the type of zero discharger referred to 
above.)

2. Categories of TC Wastes Affected by Today's Rule 



The following TC wastes are subject to UTS: 
(1) all wastes identified as D018 through D043 (described in the 
proposed rule as ``new organic constituents); (2) D012 through 
D017 organic pesticide wastes whose TCLP extract composition 
meets the concentration criteria of 40 CFR 261.24, Table A but 
whose EP extract composition does not; (3) D012 through D017 
pesticide wastes whose TCLP extract composition meets the 
concentration criteria of 40 CFR 261.24 Table A, as does the EP 
extract composition, and (4) soil and debris contaminated with 
the preceeding three sets of wastes. The first two categories 
are newly identified wastes, i.e. wastes not yet identified as 
hazardous at the time of the 1984 amendments and therefore not 
covered by the original statutory schedule. (The March 29, 1990 
rule extended the list of chemicals defined as TC and changed the 
extraction step to a more sensitive procedure which may 
potentially identify more pesticide wastes than did the EP.) For 
soil contaminated with the TC wastes, the variance process is 
available (see discussion in the Background section of this rule 
under the heading ``E. Treatment Standards for Hazardous 
Soil''). 

As noted in the proposed rule, regulating land disposal of 
newly identified TC wastes by addressing underlying hazardous 
constituents is the same approach as EPA adopted in the recent 
interim final rule for ignitable (D001) and corrosive (D002) 
characteristic wastes, promulgated on May 10, 1993 (published on 
May 24, 1993, 58 FR 29860) in response to the court's decision in 


Chemical Waste Management

 v. 

EPA

, 976 F. 2d 2. That case vacated 
and remanded certain Agency regulations (commonly referred to as 
the Third Third rule) establishing prohibitions and treatment 
standards for characteristic wastes, and also established rules 
as to when the prohibitions and standards would not apply. A 
summary of the court's decision, an overview of the interim final 
rule published on May 24, 1993, and a discussion of how the 
Agency proposed to apply this approach to the TC wastes can be 
found in the text of the proposed rule at 58 FR 48092. 

Today's rule regulates underlying hazardous constituents in 
the D018-D043 as well as in newly identified D012-D017 and in the 
rest of the universe of D012-D017 wastes. (The definition of 
``underlying hazardous constituents'' is contained at 268.2(i) in 
this rule.) For those D012-D017 nonwastewaters originally 
regulated in the Third Third rule, today's rule changes the 
numerical value of the previously applicable treatment standards 
to the UTS. 


3. Soil Contaminated by Underground Storage Tanks 



Soil which is contaminated with petroleum and is managed 
during corrective action of releases from a RCRA Subtitle I 
underground storage tank (UST) is not subject to the treatment 
standards promulgated today for the TC organic wastes (D018-D043). Such soil that fails the TC for one or more
of the newly 
identified organic wastes (D018-D043) has been temporarily 
deferred from regulation as a hazardous waste (55 FR 26986). In 
addition, the Agency has proposed to permanently exempt UST 
petroleum-contaminated soils from the TC rule (58 FR 8504). 
However, any Subtitle I petroleum-contaminated soil identified as 
D001 through D017 would not be subject to the deferral and would 
be subject to all applicable RCRA land disposal restriction 
requirements.

The Agency reminds the regulated community that any soil 
contaminated by a release from a hazardous substance UST 
(Subtitle I) as well as from all non-Subtitle I USTs (including 
petroleum tanks) will continue to be subject to applicable RCRA 
hazardous waste requirements, including the land disposal 
restrictions. Likewise, petroleum-contaminated soils from non- 
UST sources that exhibit a hazardous characteristic are also 
subject to applicable Subtitle C requirements. 


4. Metal TC Wastes Are Not Affected by Today's Rule 



Today's rule does not affect TC metal wastes at all; this 
rule leaves the Third Third final treatment standards (which 
apply to EP metals) in place. Furthermore, today's rule does not 
affect the mineral processing wastes which were formerly exempt 
from Subtitle C regulation under the Bevill Amendment but which 
recently lost that exemption. Included in that set of wastes are 
wastes from the remediation of historic manufactured gas plant or 
coal gasification sites. EPA will address TC metal wastes and 
the former Bevill mineral processing wastes in a future 
rulemaking. 


B. Background 


1. Legal and Policy Basis for Today's TC Standards 



Today's rule applies the UTS to underlying hazardous 
constituents in D012-D043 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. 
Commenters' principal objection to the proposed standards for TC 
wastes was that the September 1992 Circuit Court decision did not 
authorize EPA to regulate underlying hazardous constituents in TC 
wastes. 

Most of these comments asserted that organic TC wastes were 
fundamentally different from ignitable or corrosive wastes and 
therefore EPA's decision to apply the standards promulgated in 
the May 24, 1993 Interim Final Rule for ignitable and corrosive 
wastes was inappropriate. These commenters said that TC wastes 
were unlikely to pose a threat to human health and the 
environment once treatment removed the single constituent, partly 
because such treatment would remove other similar hazardous 
components of the waste. None of these commenters submitted 
process data demonstrating these claims. On the other hand, some 
commenters argued that merely deactivating characteristic wastes 
might well leave hazardous components intact. 

The Agency is regulating in this rule underlying hazardous 
constituents in TC wastes when they are managed in non-CWA/non-CWA equivalent/non-Class I injection well waste
management 
systems. If, as commenters assert, treatment of the TC 
constituent effectively treats underlying hazardous constituents, 
then regulating the underlying hazardous constituent poses no 
further burden. Additionally, EPA believes that the compliance 
monitoring provisions requiring the generator to address only 
those underlying constituents ``reasonably expected to be present 
in the wastes'' relieves generators and treaters from an undue 
regulatory burden. 

Several commenters objected that extending the requirement 
to treat underlying hazardous constituents from ignitable and 
corrosive wastes, as promulgated in the May 24, 1993 Interim 
Final Rule, to TC wastes was unnecessary. The numerical 
treatment standard for the constituent present at the TC level, 
the commenters reasoned, meets RCRA's section 3004(m) ``minimize 
threat'' requirement. EPA is not persuaded by such reasoning. 55 
FR 22542, 22652 (June 1, 1990); Chemical Waste Management, 976 
F.2d at 14; HWTC III, 886 F. 2d at 362. The TC level identifies 
wastes that are clearly hazardous, and does not evaluate presence 
of underlying hazardous constituents, non-groundwater exposure 
pathways, or adverse environmental effects. 


2. Ongoing Management Practices for TC Wastes 



The proposed rule solicited comments and data on volumes of 
TC wastes managed in Class V injection wells, and on waste 
management practices employed prior to such injection. EPA 
received little substantive comment and consequently has no basis 
for changing the proposed approach. 

The proposed rule also solicited information about 
industrial generation patterns in order to allow the Agency to 
assess the potential for source reduction or recycling for these 
TC wastes in light of their wide diversity. However, EPA 
received no comments describing current industry practices upon 
which the Agency could act. 

The Agency is to consider opportunities for source reduction 
and recycling of these wastes, and ways treatment standards could 
reflect such types of waste minimization. The Agency notes that 
the subtitle C rules generally, and the LDR rules in particular, 
have already resulted in substantial volumes of hazardous waste 
no longer being generated, because these rules impose waste 
management costs on hazardous waste generators, and thus create a 
financial incentive to generate less waste. 

Finally, several commenters expressed concerns about 
achievability of UTS for underlying hazardous constituents in 
complex matrices and about the appropriateness of numerical 
standards based on incineration. See the discussion of UTS in 
section III.A of this preamble for more information on these 
comments.

C. Treatment Standards for New TC Organic Constituents (D018-D043) 


1. Nonwastewaters 


The Agency is also promulgating concentration-based 
treatment standards for TC organic constituents in 
nonwastewaters, that are identical to the levels promulgated as 
UTS in a separate section of this preamble. These standards are 
based on treatment data that were used to establish UTS for these 
same constituents in listed wastes. These standards are 
primarily based on incineration data and are presented at the end 
of this section. 
EPA believes that a variety of treatment technologies, 
combustion and non-combustion, can achieve these treatment 
standards. EPA reiterates that any technology that does not 
constitute impermissible dilution can be used to meet these 
concentration levels.

2. Wastewaters 



The Agency is today promulgating concentration-based 
treatment standards for the TC organic constituents in 
wastewaters, that are identical to the levels promulgated as 
UTS in a separate part of today's rule. These standards were 
based on existing treatment data that were used to establish 
UTS for these same constituents in the broad array of listed 
wastes. Today's standards are based on data representing a 
variety of wastewater treatment units and are presented at the 
end of this section. 

These wastewater treatment standards apply to newly 
identified TC wastewaters that are managed in systems other 
than those regulated under the CWA, those regulated under the 
SDWA that inject TC wastewaters into Class I injection wells, 
and those zero discharge facilities that engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal. The treatment
standards promulgated today for newly identified TC organic (D018-D043) wastewaters require treatment to
meet the UTS for the TC constituent and for the underlying hazardous constituents in the TC waste as generated.

3. Radioactive Mixed Waste 


Radioactive mixed wastes are those wastes that satisfy the 
definition of radioactive waste subject to the Atomic Energy Act 
(AEA) that also contain waste that is either listed as a 
hazardous waste in Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 261, or that exhibit 
any of the hazardous waste characteristics identified in subpart 
C of 40 CFR Part 261. Since the hazardous portions of the mixed 
waste are subject to RCRA, the land disposal restrictions apply. 
This means that the RCRA hazardous portion of all mixed waste 
must meet the appropriate treatment standards for all applicable 
waste codes before land disposal. Therefore, any radioactive 
waste mixed with organic TC wastes that are managed in non-CWA/non-CWA-equivalent/non-Class I SDWA facilities
must meet the treatment standards being promulgated today for the TC wastes.

The standards that were proposed for the TC wastes were also 
proposed for TC radioactive mixed wastes. Prior to this 
proposal, however, the Department of Energy (DOE) had expressed 
some concerns about meeting certain treatment standards and 
stated that they were collecting data from their facilities on 
mixed TC wastes. EPA stated in the proposed rule that, for the 
most part, the low concentrations of radioactive compounds should 
not interfere with the treatability of the hazardous constituents 
in the waste, and requested data on instances when the 
radioactivity prevented the waste from meeting the LDR treatment 
standard. 

One commenter suggested that EPA postpone its decision on 
appropriate methods for treating mixed waste until information 
currently being collected profiling commercially generated low- 
level radioactive mixed waste has been submitted and reviewed by 
EPA. This commenter claimed that the results of this profile 
contradict EPA's statement that radioactive material 
concentrations in mixed waste are low and should not interfere 
with the treatment of the mixed waste. Another commenter 
expressed the belief that the presence of radioactive components 
within the limits of operator exposure and safety should not 
interfere with the treatment of hazardous constituents in waste. 

Neither commenter submitted any data or other supporting 
information to substantiate their assertions regarding the 
treatability of radioactive mixed waste; therefore, EPA has 
decided to promulgate the standards for newly identified TC 
radioactive mixed wastes as proposed. However, if data is 
submitted to EPA indicating that the presence of radioactive 
components prevents a waste from meeting the LDR treatment 
standards, the Agency will evaluate the data and amend the 
standards as appropriate. The Agency's variance provisions of 40 
CFR 268.44 can also be used to obtain alternate limits in the meantime.

The Agency is promulgating treatment standards for these 
wastes essentially as proposed with the additional requirement 
that underlying hazardous constituents be treated in 
nonwastewater forms of these wastes. Today's standards apply to 
all D012-D017 wastes managed in non-CWA/non-CWA-equivalent/non-Class I injection well waste management
facilities. These are 
the toxic pesticide wastes which are identified as toxic 
following application of the TCLP. The TCLP is more sensitive 
than the EP analysis, possibly bringing more wastes into the 
toxicity characteristic category than did the EP. 



1. Newly Identified Pesticide Nonwastewaters 



EPA is today regulating newly identified D012-D017 
nonwastewaters plus D012-D017 nonwastewaters regulated earlier in 
the Third Third rule. Treatment standards for both sets of D012-D017 nonwastewaters include the UTS value for
the TC constituents 
plus UTS values for underlying hazardous constituents. The 
changes between the Third Third standards and today's rule are 
that the numerical value of the toxaphene nonwastewater standard 
rises from 1.3 to 2.6 and the standard for D013, lindane, 
incorporates numbers for the four BHC isomers. (It should be 
noted that EPA determined that the amount of D012-D017 waste 
subject to the treatment standards is very small. 55 FR at 
22634, 22646. Based on this determination, it is very unlikely 
that newly identified D012-D017 are being generated.) 

Today's rule also prohibits dilution of D012-D017 
nonwastewaters injected into Class I deep injection wells. 
Consequently, these pesticide wastes must be treated to meet the 
treatment standards before they can permissibly be injected into 
such units, unless that unit has been granted a no-migration 
determination. Section VIII of this preamble discusses this and 
other deepwell injection issues presented in today's rule in more 
detail. 





 

2. Pesticide Wastewaters 



EPA set treatment standards expressed as required methods of 
treatment for the EP toxic pesticide wastewaters in the Third 
Third final rule (55 FR 22554). Today's rule extends these 
treatment standards to those pesticide wastewaters covered in 
today's rule. (See 268.40) 



E. Exemptions for De Minimis Losses of Commercial Chemical 
 Product or Chemical Intermediates That Exhibit the Toxicity 
 Characteristic (TC), and for TC Laboratory Wastes Discharged 
 to CWA Wastewater Treatment Systems 



In the Interim Final Rule published May 24, 1993, EPA 
established 

de minimis

 exemptions for commercial chemical product 
or chemical intermediates that are ignitable or corrosive 
hazardous wastes and that contained underlying hazardous 
constituents (58 FR 29875). The Agency proposed in Phase II to 
extend the exemptions in 40 CFR 268.1 to commercial chemical 
products or chemical intermediates that are TC organic wastes 
when disposed (58 FR 48118). Commenters expressed support for 
this approach. 

This action is necessary to avoid situations where minor 
leaks of organic TC commercial chemical products or chemical 
intermediates to a wastewater treatment system would potentially 
trigger all of the potential consequences of treating all 
underlying hazardous constituents that might be in the waste. As 
EPA noted in originally determining that the mixture rule should 
not apply in such situations, such small losses are as a 
practical matter unavoidable; responsible management involves 
channeling these minor losses to a centralized wastewater 
treatment system. In addition, there is a natural incentive to 
minimize the losses because the materials would otherwise be 
commercial chemical products or intermediates (46 FR 56583, Nov. 
17, 1981). Moreover, allowing 

de minimis

 losses of TC materials 
to trigger all of the LDR treatment consequences would be 
anomalously stringent because 

de minimis

 losses of listed wastes 
(i.e., the commercial chemical products listed in  261.33), 
which tend to be more concentrated (see generally 58 FR at 
29875), would not be regulated because of the exception to the 
mixture rule found at  261.3(a)(iv)(D). 

This same type of exception is needed for TC laboratory 
wastes that are commingled with other plant wastewaters under 
designated circumstances: TC laboratory wastes containing 
underlying hazardous constituents from laboratory operations, 
that are mixed with other plant wastewaters at facilities whose 
ultimate discharge is subject to regulation under the CWA 
(including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the 
discharge of wastewater), provided that the annualized flow of 
laboratory wastewater into the facility's headwork does not 
exceed one part per million (the same condition that applies to 
the existing exemption in  261.3(a)(2)(iv)(E)). 

Thus 

de minimis

 losses of commercial chemical product or 
chemical intermediates that are TC organic wastes, and TC organic 
laboratory wastes discharged to CWA wastewater treatment systems, 
are not subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 268. 

De minimis

 
losses are those occurring from normal material handling, minor 
leaks of equipment tanks or containers, and similar small but, 
for practical purposes, unavoidable losses. See  261.3(a)(2)(iv)(D) and 268.1(e)(4) as promulgated at 58
FR 29884 
(May 24, 1993). The definition of 

de minimis

 loss is the same as 
EPA used in the May 24, 1993 rule. This definition mirrors the 
parallel language in  261.3(a)(iv)(D) except that it also 
includes discharges from safety showers and rinsing and cleaning 
of personal safety equipment and rinsate from empty containers or 
from containers that are rendered empty by that rinsing. When 
the  268.1(e)(4) definition was originally promulgated in the 
May 24, 1993 rule, it seemed unlikely that ignitable or corrosive 
wastes would be generated from safety showers or rinsate. The 
Agency believes it is more likely that TC wastes could be 
generated in such a manner, therefore, the definition is being 
expanded to include this language in this rule. 

EPA also notes that the characteristic commercial chemical 
products exempted under this rule and the May, 1993 rule are not 
limited to products in which a particular chemical is ``the 
commercially pure grade of the chemical, any technical grades of 
the chemical, and all formulations in which the chemical is the 
sole active ingredient.'' (See  261.33(d) comment). Rather, the 
exemption extends to 

de minimis

 losses (as defined) of in-process 
materials such as intermediates and materials that would be 
products if they were not inadvertently discarded. 55 FR at 2869 
(Jan. 31, 1991). The citation in the comment to  261.33(d), 
quoted above, is necessary to define the scope of the listing, 
but as just explained, does not apply to losses of characteristic 
materials.

V. Treatment Standards for Newly Listed Wastes 


A. Treatment Standards for Coke By-product Production Wastes 


K141_Process residues from the recovery of coal tar, including but not limited to tar collecting sump residues from
the production of coke from coal or the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal. This listing does not include
K087, decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations. 
K142_Tar storage tank residues from the production of coke from coal or the recovery of coke by-products produced
from coal. 
K143_Process residues from the recovery of light oil, including but not limited to those generated in stills, decanters,
and wash oil recovery units from the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal. 
K144_Wastewater treatment sludges from light oil refining, including but not limited to intercepting or contamination
sump sludges from the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal. 
K145_Residues from naphthalene collection and recovery operations from the recovery of coke by-products produced
from coal. 
K147_Tar storage tank residues from coal tar refining. 
K148_Residues from coal tar distillation, including but not limited to still bottoms. 



EPA is promulgating the treatment standards that were proposed for coke by-product production wastes. These treatment
standards also apply to soil and debris contaminated with these wastes, although a variance process is available
for such soils (see discussion on variances in the Background section of this rule under the heading ``E. Treatment
Standards for Hazardous Soil''). The preamble of the proposed rule describes the generation and characteristics
of the newly listed wastes in greater detail (58 FR 48119). Today's standards are concentration-based limits for
wastewaters and nonwastewaters, numerically identical to the UTS promulgated elsewhere in this rule for the nine
constituents regulated in these wastes. 
The American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute requested that EPA allow the use of these wastes as fuels in blast furnaces
and other applications where coke, coal and coal tar are used as fuels. The commenters were requesting EPA to extend
the existing recycling exclusion_which allows these wastes to be combined with coal feedstock residue as it is charged
to the coke oven, added to the coal recovery process or mixed with coal tar before this coal tar is sold as a product or
further refined. Extending this exclusion is beyond the scope of this regulation; it was not included in the September
proposal as an option for managing these wastes. The Definition of Solid Waste Task Force is examining the broad range
of these types of issues. 
The other comments received concerning the proposed treatment standards for coke products' wastes came from the
waste treatment industry. Several waste treatment companies supported applying universal standards to these waste
streams and the UTS concept in general. However, one commenter provided data in support of extending the standards
originally applied to K087 to these wastes. EPA evaluated these data but found no reason not to apply UTS to these wastes.
EPA's evaluation of these data is presented in the Background Document for these wastes. In separate comments, two
waste treatment companies objected to the benzene nonwastewater standards as unnecessarily high and pointed out
that their facilities could achieve benzene limits below that proposed in the UTS. EPA does not believe these data
really reflect better treatment. Rather, the commenters appear to have generated a waste matrix in which benzene
is detectable at lower levels. EPA is promulgating the benzene nonwastewater standard as proposed, believing that
it reflects an appropriate and broader assessment of benzene detection limits in combustion residues.

B. Treatment Standards for Chlorotoluenes


K149_Distillation bottoms from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes,
benzoyl chlorides, and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. (This waste does not include still bottoms
from the distillation of benzyl chloride.) 
K150_Organic residuals, excluding spent carbon adsorbent, from the spent chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid recovery
processes associated with the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes,
benzoyl chlorides, and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. 
K151_Wastewater treatment sludges, excluding neutralization and biological sludges, generated during the treatment
of wastewaters from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluenes, ring-chlorinated toluenes, benzoyl
chlorides and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups.



EPA is promulgating the treatment standards that were proposed for chlorotoluene wastes. The preamble of the proposed
rule describes the generation and characteristics in greater detail (58 FR 48121). Today's standards are concentration-based
limits for wastewaters and nonwastewaters, numerically identical to the UTS promulgated elsewhere in this rule
for the thirteen constituents regulated in these wastes. 
Comments received concerning the proposed treatment standards for chlorotoluene wastes came from the waste treatment
industry; they were similar to those received concerning the treatment standards for coking wastes. Several waste
treatment companies supported applying universal standards to these waste streams and the UTS concept in general.
Two waste treatment companies objected to the benzene nonwastewater standards as unnecessarily high and pointed
out that their facilities could achieve benzene limits below that proposed in the UTS. EPA, however, believes that
the UTS for benzene nonwastewaters reflects an appropriate and broad assessment of benzene detection levels in combustion
residues.

VI. Debris Contaminated With Newly Listed or Identified Wastes



Debris contaminated with the hazardous wastes included in today's rule must be treated prior to land disposal. The
hazardous debris may be treated to meet the treatment standards promulgated today for the constituents which are
contaminating the debris, or it may be treated to meet the alternative debris standards promulgated in the LDR for
Newly Listed Wastes and Hazardous Debris (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992).



A. Debris Treated To Meet the Phase II Treatment Standards



Debris that is treated to meet the treatment standards promulgated in today's rule for newly listed wastes would remain
subject to the hazardous waste management regulations (subtitle C) for as long as the debris ``contains'' the hazardous
waste (see 57 FR 37625-26, August 18, 1992). On the other hand, debris that is treated to meet the treatment standards
promulgated in today's rule for newly identified TC organic wastes, including any underlying hazardous constituents
the generator reasonably expects to be present in the waste, could be disposed in a nonhazardous waste (subtitle D)
landfill because the characteristic identifying the waste as hazardous is removed through meeting the LDR treatment
standards.



B. Debris Treated To Meet the Alternative Debris Treatment Standards



The alternative treatment standards require the use of specific technologies from one or more of the following categories:
extraction technologies, destruction technologies, or immobilization. Treatment must be performed in accordance
with specified performance standards found in the regulations at 40 CFR 268.45. If one of the extraction or destruction
technologies is used, and the debris does not display any characteristic of hazardous waste, then EPA would consider
the treated debris to no longer contain hazardous waste. Such treated debris could, therefore, be reused, returned
to the natural environment, or disposed in a nonhazardous waste (subtitle D) facility. Nondebris residuals generated
from the treatment of debris contaminated with listed wastes would still be hazardous wastes by virtue of the derived-from
rule and would be subject to the hazardous waste management system, including the treatment standards for newly listed
wastes in today's rule.



VII. Response to Comments Regarding Exclusion of Hazardous Debris That Has Been Treated by Immobilization Technologies



A. Background



The final Phase I Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) rule promulgated on June 30, 1992 (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992),
excludes from Subtitle C control hazardous debris that is treated using an extraction or destruction technology
provided the treated debris meets the performance standards specified in  268.45 Table 1. Our basis for doing
this is that the debris no longer contains the hazardous waste. On the other hand, hazardous debris treated by an immobilization
technology is still subject to the hazardous waste regulations because the Agency has insufficient data or information
to support that such treated debris would not leach Appendix VIII constituents over time in a manner that would be protective
to human health and the environment. In our proposal to the Phase I LDR rule, the Agency solicited comment on whether
immobilized hazardous debris should be excluded from Subtitle C control. While the Agency received favorable comments
on excluding such treated debris from the hazardous waste regulations, no information or data was provided to support
such a position. Therefore, the final rule requires that immobilized hazardous debris continue to be managed as a
hazardous waste.

The Agency decided to revisit the issue of whether immobilized hazardous debris, if treated in certain ways or is treated
to meet certain limits, should be excluded from Subtitle C control. As a result, since the promulgation of the Phase
I LDR rule, the Agency has undertaken a number of activities.



B. Roundtable Discussion



In an attempt to gather information on the issue, the Agency sponsored a roundtable discussion on August 3, 1992. Participants
at the meeting included persons who commented on the Phase I LDR rule, debris treatment vendors, hazardous waste treaters
and disposers, state officials, and officials from the Department of Energy (see Docket for specific list of attendees).
Representatives from the environmental interest groups were also invited but were unable to attend. The purpose
of the meeting was to gather information and discuss various regulatory approaches that would allow the Agency to
exclude immobilized hazardous debris from Subtitle C control. While no specific data was gathered, there was a general
discussion on the types of standards that could be applied such as design and operating standards, leach test, structural
integrity test, permeability test for encapsulating material, so as to exclude immobilized hazardous debris from
hazardous waste control. Additionally, the following points were also made by one or more participants at the roundtable.


 A number of the attendees indicated that even if immobilized hazardous debris were excluded from hazardous
waste control, it would continue to be managed as a hazardous waste due to CERCLA liability concerns.

 There was some question whether a specific exclusion for immobilized hazardous debris was necessary or whether
the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) may be a more appropriate mechanism for addressing this issue.

 A representative from the glass industry suggested that glass cullet and vitreous materials should have a
separate treatment standard. He indicated that the glass matrix would not leach lead at a higher rate than would an
immobilized product_that is, it made little sense to grind up the glass material and then to stabilize it when the original
matrix is just as sound.

<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While no consensus was reached, the following principles 
were generally arrived at by most of the participants at the 
meeting. 

Microencapsulation: Participants at the meeting seem to 
believe that using a leach test may be more appropriate to 
demonstrate effective microencapsulation immobilization over an 
approach of developing design and operating standards. It was 
noted that treatment of hazardous debris is very waste and debris 
specific; if one could define design and operating standards that 
were generally applicable, they would likely be too burdensome in 
many cases. 

Macroencapsulation/Sealing: The participants seem to 
indicate that the grinding requirement in the TCLP leach test 
made it inappropriate for predicting performance of 
macroencapsulation/sealing immobilization technologies. These 
technologies rely on an impermeable coating applied to the 
outside of the debris. Rather, the participants suggested a 
structural test to determine whether the given debris/technology 
combination was sufficient to maintain the coating or a 
permeability test for the coating media. While the participants 
conceptually believed that such an approach was workable, no one 
was able to suggest a specific test or standard. In addition, it 
was felt by some of the participants that the development of such 
a test could be difficult to develop. 

While no data or information was provided at the meeting, it 
was indicated that if such information was submitted to the 
Agency, the Agency would consider such information in making its 
decision. 



C. EPA Investigations 



In addition to the above roundtable discussions, EPA has 
also been reviewing the literature and talking to vendors in an 
effort to obtain sufficient information on how to propose 
standards that could allow the exclusion of immobilized hazardous 
debris. At the time the Phase II LDR rule was proposed, no 
useful insights had been gained on how to specify design and 
operating standards that would ensure that immobilized hazardous 
debris was nonhazardous; the reason for this was the paucity of 
experience in immobilizing hazardous debris. Nevertheless, the 
Agency expressed interest in pursuing this area and specifically 
sought assistance from the regulated community on this issue. 



D. Specific Questions for Which Comments Were Solicited 



While the Agency had a better sense of the types of 
standards that may be appropriate for excluding immobilized 
hazardous debris from Subtitle C control at the time of the Phase 
II proposal, the Agency still did not have the data to propose 
specific exclusions. For microencapsulation in particular, if a 
leach test were the most appropriate mechanism for determining 
whether such treated debris is nonhazardous, the Agency expressed 
the belief that HWIR may be the most appropriate rulemaking to 
address this issue. The Agency had a series of studies underway, 
was evaluating comments, but was not in a position to determine 
what such levels were at that time. With respect to 
macroencapsulation/sealing, additional data or information needed 
to be gathered before the Agency would be in a position to 
exclude this type of immobilized hazardous debris. To assist the 
Agency in this effort, we specifically solicited comment on the 
following questions: 

Microencapsulation: 

 Is the use of a leach test for excluding immobilized 
 hazardous debris more appropriate than specification of 
 design and operating standards? 

 Is exclusion of immobilized hazardous debris using design 
 and operating standards workable? 

Macroencapsulation/Sealing: 

 What type of structural or other test could be used? 

 What type of criteria should be applied in determining 
 whether such debris is nonhazardous? 

The Agency is also considering allowing stabilization for 
soils containing low levels of organic constituents, and 
solicited comment on whether similar stabilization techniques or 
tests to ensure the effectiveness of such stabilization would be 
appropriate for excluding debris from Subtitle C control. 

In addition, the Agency specifically solicited comment on 
any available data or information to demonstrate that immobilized 
hazardous debris (if treated properly) would not pose a 
substantial hazard to human health and the environment, stating 
that if such information were submitted to the Agency, the Agency 
would exclude such debris from Subtitle C control. 



E. Comments Received and Conclusions 



Microencapsulation: One commenter stated that specifying 
design and operating standards is appropriate for excluding 
immobilized hazardous debris from subtitle C, asserting that 
nothing is gained in performing a leach test on hazardous debris. 
Other commenters suggested that EPA consider a combination of a 
structural test combined with a leaching test conducted on a 
representative intact sample of the encapsulated waste. None of 
these commenters submitted any supporting information to 
substantiate these conflicting claims. However, the commenters 
did agree that if a leach test is used, the TCLP as it is now 
defined is inappropriate for immobilized debris. 

Macroencapsulation/Sealing: Several commenters claimed that 
the TCLP test is inappropriate for immobilized material because 
the size reduction required by the test protocol destroys the 
encapsulant, thereby defeating the purpose of the technology. 
These commenters suggested that EPA instead consider a 
combination of a structural test (a 50 psi standard was 
suggested) combined with a leaching test conducted on a 
representative intact sample of the encapsulated waste. These 
commenters did not submit any data to verify that a 50 psi 
standard would insure the integrity of the immobilized waste, and 
although some commenters recommended that a new leach test 
protocol be developed, they did not suggest any specific 
protocols for a leach test on the intact debris waste. 

Exclusion of Immobilized Debris from Subtitle C Regulation: 
Several commenters maintained that debris treated with an 
immobilization technology should be excluded from Subtitle C 
regulation. However, these commenters did not submit any 
supporting data to verify this claim.

Two commenters claimed that a careful reading of 40 CFR 
268.7(b) indicates that waste which is treated using a specified 
treatment technology is not subject to further testing to exit 
Subtitle C and claimed that the rules for debris treated in 
accordance with the alternative treatment standards specified in 
40 CFR 268.45 should be the same. Their interpretation of this 
section of the CFR is incorrect. With regard to wastes for which 
technologies have been specified as the treatment standard, 40 
CFR 268.7(b) contains the wording of the certification stating 
that the waste has been treated in accordance with  268.42; this 
certification must be signed before the waste may be land 
disposed. 40 CFR 268.7(b) does not say that this waste is no 
longer subject to subtitle C regulation. 
 

One commenter suggested that, at a minimum, EPA should 
establish health based numerical standards for exclusion of 
hazardous debris from subtitle C. This commenter made no 
suggestion as to what test method should be used. The issue of 
basing LDR standards on the basis of risk rather than technology 
performance is addressed in Section III A 2 a of this rule, 
``Risk-based Universal Treatment Standards.'' 
 

Finally, one commenter suggested that EPA allow the use of 
stainless steel as an encapsulant, claiming that its performance 
would be superior to that of other encapsulants, such as 
polymeric organics, which allegedly fail due to the radiation 
effects to their chemical bonds. 
 

Conclusions: Although commenters were in general agreement 
on a number of issues (e.g. inappropriateness of the TCLP for 
debris, use of a 50 psi structural test as a performance 
standard, use of a leach test performed on intact debris), no 
supporting data or other information was submitted to support 
their claims and requests. Therefore, the Agency is not 
promulgating any modifications to the debris rule at this time. 
The Agency is evaluating exclusions as part of the HWIR process 
and will reassess appropriate action on debris if HWIR does not 
adequately address debris. 




VIII. Deep Well Injection Issues 



A. Prohibition of Dilution of High TOC Ignitable and of TC 
 Pesticide Wastes Injected Into Class I Deep Wells 
 



Today's rule prohibits the disposal of two types of waste 
into deep-well injection via Class I Underground Injection 
Control (UIC) wells unless the wastes first meet the land 
disposal restrictions promulgated in today's rule for these 
wastes, or the wastes are injected into a well that is subject to 
a no-migration determination. These wastes are nonwastewaters 
exhibiting the characteristic of ignitability at the point of 
generation and containing greater than 10 percent Total Organic 
Carbon (``high TOC ignitable liquids subcategory'') and also TC 
toxic halogenated pesticide wastes (DO12-D017). Thus, EPA is 
promulgating, as proposed, regulations excluding these two wastes 
from the portion of the rule at 40 CFR 268.1(c)(3) that allows a 
waste to be injected into a Class I deep injection well if the 
waste no longer exhibits a characteristic at the point of 
injection. Today's rule also includes a one-year capacity 
variance for these injected waste streams. 
 


For D001 High TOC ignitables, the treatment standard is 
expressed as methods of treatment that must be used prior to land 
disposal: combustion (i.e. incineration or fuel substitution) or 
recovery of organics. The preamble to the proposed rule stated 
that high TOC ignitable nonwastewaters contain high 
concentrations of organics that can either be recovered directly 
for reuse, or can be burned in combustion devices. These wastes 
are not injected in significant volumes, so that redirection of 
the wastes to treatment technologies will not have significant 
impact on well operators. 58 FR 48118-48119. EPA received no 
information to the contrary from commenters. 



 
The treatment standards for TC pesticide wastewaters are 
also expressed as methods of treatment: biodegradation or 
incineration. On the other hand, the treatment standards for EP 
pesticide nonwastewaters are expressed as levels that may be 
achieved by using any treatment technology, other than 
impermissible dilution. (The Third Third rule had already 
disqualified these wastes from the exception that allowed 
dilution of characteristic wastes that were to be managed in 
Clean Water Act treatment systems including surface land disposal 
units,  268.3(b) and 55 FR 22657.) 



 

As discussed at length in the preamble to the proposed rule, 
the Agency's initial reading of the D.C. Circuit Court's decision 
is that wastes that are characteristically hazardous at the point 
of generation must typically be treated to destroy or remove 
hazardous constituents before land disposal, or be disposed of in 
a no-migration unit. 976 F.2d at 24. This is certainly a 
permissible interpretation of the opinion. Furthermore, the 
decision encompasses underground injection wells, specifically 
Class I deep wells, since they are permanent land disposal units. 
976 F.2d at 25. Thus, under this reading of the court's 
opinion, these ignitable and pesticide wastes would have to be 
treated to remove hazardous constituents before injection. 
 


EPA's decision to prohibit injection of these untreated 
wastes, however, is based not only on its initial interpretation 
of the Chemical Waste Management opinion (which, as noted below, 
may still evolve), but also on the particular wastes involved 
here. The wastes at issue are ignitable wastes with potentially 
very high concentrations of hazardous constituents, and pesticide 
wastes containing very toxic constituents. 
 

Treatment is also warranted to reduce the amounts of these 
toxic wastes being land disposed. RCRA section 1003(a)(6) 
(``statutory goal of minimizing the . . . land disposal of hazardous 
waste by encouraging . . . properly conducted recycling and reuse, 
and treatment''); 

Steel Manufacturers' Association 

v. 

EPA, 

XXX

 F.3d 

XXX

, (D.C. Cir. July 9, 1994) (``We conclude that minimizing the overall volume of slag that is to be disposed is by itself,
a 
sufficient justification for the zinc treatment standard . . .'') 
(slip op. at 13). Finally, only small volumes of these wastes 
are injected, and segregation of the wastes should not prove to 
be unduly difficult. For all of these reasons, the Agency 
believes it appropriate to prohibit injection of these wastes at 
this time, unless the wastes are treated to satisfy section 
3004(m) or are disposed in a no-migration unit. In this regard, 
the Agency emphasizes that no-migration petitions for Class I 
nonhazardous wells receiving decharacterized wastes may be 
submitted to EPA or the Authorized States for evaluation at this 
time. The petitions may encompass not only the pesticide and 
high-TOC ignitable wastes prohibited in this rule, but other 
types of decharacterized wastes (which are not yet prohibited but 
are scheduled to be addressed in Phase III) as well. 
 


Most comments to the proposed rule requested independent 
consideration of Class I injection wells, because they believed 
that underground injection differs from other forms of land 
disposal, such as landfills and impoundments. Other comments 
questioned EPA's interpretation of the Third Third court decision 
and the Agency's belief that treatment of these waste streams 
should be the preferred management approach for them. These 
commenters indicated that aggregation of waste streams meets the 
minimize threat standard and expressed their opinion that 
segregation of these wastes for treatment poses substantial risks 
to the environment and that underground injection is an 
inherently safer waste management practice. The Agency intends 
to consider all the above arguments (e.g., risks posed by wastes 
going to deep well injection) in the identification of alternatives for land disposal standards. The Agency will

continue to investigate any and all information received 
concerning these comments, and intends to address land disposal 
standards for underground injection of characteristic wastes in a 
comprehensive manner in the Phase III rulemaking. Until these 
treatment standards become effective one year from the date of 
publication of this rule, they may continue to be injected into 
Class I injection wells without prior treatment.

B. Request for Comment on Petition From Chemical Manufacturer's 
 Association Regarding Deep Well Injection of Ignitable and 
 Corrosive Characteristic Wastes 
 



The proposed rule solicited comments on a request from the 
Chemical Manufacturer's Association (CMA) that EPA develop 
separate treatment standards intended for those wastes disposed 
in Class I deep injection wells. CMA requested a separate set of 
treatment standards for ignitable and corrosive wastes managed by 
deep well injection that, in view of the unique circumstances of 
deep well injection, meet the statutory ``minimize threats'' 
standard. Many comments received by EPA urged the Agency to 
develop so-called UIC-specific treatment standards in light of 
this petition. However, EPA received virtually no technical 
information to support these comments. 
 

Therefore, the Agency is not issuing a final response to 
CMA's request in today's rule. EPA continues to solicit 
information necessary to enable EPA to act on this petition in 
the future. These requests are documented in the rulemaking 
docket for today's rule. In particular, the Agency particularly 
requests data concerning waste volumes, waste transport, 
injection system integrity or the fate of disposed pollutants throughout the course of the injection procedure.





IX. Modifications to Hazardous Waste Recycling Regulations 



A. Introduction 
 


Today's rulemaking finalizes the proposed changes to the 
hazardous waste recycling regulations, thus slightly broadening 
the scope of an existing exclusion (and related variance). This 
modification of the regulatory framework will allow for 
environmentally beneficial recycling to occur without unnecessary 
regulatory consequences. 
 
EPA wishes to note that the changes to the definition of 
solid waste being promulgated today are narrow in scope and will 
have minor impact. A more broad-ranged evaluation of the 
regulations applicable to the recycling of hazardous waste is 
being conducted by EPA's Definition of Solid Waste Task Force. 
This Task Force has been administering a public dialogue process 
to examine the overall impacts of the RCRA program on recycling, 
and will consider broader changes to the definition of solid 
waste as part of that process. 




B. Modification of the Existing ``Closed-loop'' Recycling 
 Exclusion and Related Case-specific Variance 




1. ``Closed-loop'' Recycling Exclusion and Related Variance 
 



In the January 4, 1985 final rule, the Agency promulgated an 
exclusion from the definition of solid waste at  
261.2(e)(1)(iii) for secondary materials that are recycled in a 
``closed-loop,'' (i.e., returned to the original production process 
in which the material was generated (see preamble discussion at 
50 FR 639)). To be considered such a ``closed-loop'' process, 
three conditions must be met. First, the secondary material must 
be returned to the original process without undergoing 
significant alteration or reprocessing (i.e., it must be returned 
without first being reclaimed. See 261.2(e)(3) and Table 1). 
Second, the production process to which the unreclaimed materials 
is returned must be a primary production process (i.e., a process 
that uses raw materials as the majority of its feedstock, as 
opposed to a secondary process that uses spent materials or scrap 
metal as the majority of its feedstock). And third, the 
secondary material must be returned as a feedstock to the 
original production process and must be recycled as part of that 
process (as opposed to an ancillary process such as degreasing). 
EPA believes that these conditions characterize a material that 
is part of an on-going production process, and as such, the 
management of the material should not be characterized as waste 
management (i.e., the material is not part of the waste 
management problem). 
 

Today's action addresses the second condition_that the 
production process to which a secondary material is returned be a 
primary process. This condition was part of the original 
exclusion due to considerations regarding jurisdiction, as it was 
understood in 1985, rather than to an evaluation of the potential 
impacts on the environment from such ``closed-loop'' recycling 
involving secondary processes. This condition thus was 
established without a consideration of whether such secondary 
materials would be part of the waste management problem. By 
definition, a secondary process uses waste materials as its 
principal feedstock. The Agency therefore concluded that the 
process residue, which is returned to the original process as a 
substitute for feedstock that is itself waste, is no less a waste 
than the waste material originally introduced (see 50 FR 639). 
(The Agency notes that with few exceptions, this condition has no 
actual impact on the recycling of residues from secondary 
processes because such residues that exhibit a characteristic of 
hazardous waste (i.e., characteristic by-products and sludges) 
are likewise excluded from the definition of solid waste if 
reclaimed.) 

 Although the Agency continues to believe that the 
jurisdictional logic behind this condition is sound, the judicial 
opinions regarding RCRA jurisdiction allow more weight to be 
given to environmental considerations. 

API

EPA (API), 

906 
F.2d at 740-41; 

AMC 

v. 

EPA (AMC II), 

907 F.2d 1179, 1186 (D.C. 
Cir. 1990). Thus, EPA has reevaluated this condition of the 
exclusion from the definition of solid waste due to its impact on 
the recycling of residues from secondary processes, in particular 
secondary lead smelters, and has determined that the condition of 
a closed-loop involving only primary processes is not legally 
compelled, and that this condition is less relevant as an 
environmental consideration, assuming that the secondary material 
is well-managed prior to reprocessing in the primary or secondary 
process that generated it.

Comments received on the Agency's proposal to remove this 
condition from the exclusion were favorable. Although several 
commenters said that the Agency should go further in modifying 
the existing regulations to encourage the recycling of hazardous 
wastes, such an action is beyond the scope of this proceeding. 
Such further action could result from the efforts currently 
underway to reevaluate the regulations applicable to hazardous 
waste recycling (i.e., the Roundtable discussions undertaken by 
the Definition of Solid Waste Task Force). One commenter also 
urged the Agency to make regulatory modifications only as part of 
the Definition of Solid Waste Task Force. EPA does not view the 
salutary and relatively modest change to the rules promulgated 
here as undermining the Task Force effort, and so is adopting the 
amendment. 
 

Thus, the Agency is today removing this condition (i.e., 
that the process be a primary production process) from the 
``closed-loop'' recycling exclusion. By doing this, secondary 
materials that are recycled back into the secondary production 
process from which they were generated are excluded from the 
definition of solid waste. 
 

Following the same reasoning, the Agency proposed and is 
today finalizing a modification to section 260.30(b), a related 
case-by-case variance for materials that are reclaimed prior to 
reuse in the original primary production process from which they 
were generated (see 50 FR 652 (January 4, 1985) for a discussion 
of the existing variance). This modification similarly expands 
the variance to make it available for materials that are returned 
to secondary processes, as well as those returned to primary 
processes. 




2. Storage Prior to Recycling 
 



At proposal, the Agency proposed to condition the ``closed-
loop'' exclusion (and the related 260.30(b) variance) such that 
secondary materials recycled back into secondary processes from 
which they were generated would continue to be managed in an 
environmentally sound manner. The Agency proposed this condition 
to address concerns that, absent this condition, a listed waste 
that would otherwise be required to be managed in a protective 
manner (e.g., without direct placement on the land) could begin 
to be managed in an unprotective manner because, as an excluded 
secondary material, no regulatory requirements would apply. 
Storage of hazardous secondary materials on the land can be 
deemed to be a type of discarding (``part of the waste disposal 
problem'' in the words of the D.C. Circuit), and hence provide a 
basis for classifying the materials as solid and hazardous 
wastes. 

AMC II, 

907 F.2d at 1187. The only comments received 
addressing this proposed condition asked for more clarification 
of what would be considered ``a protective manner.'' The Agency 
is promulgating the condition to the exclusion that such 
secondary materials be managed in a protective manner such that 
there is no placement on the land, that is no land disposal as 
defined in  3004(k). See  261.4(a)(10) and (11) where EPA has 
attached this same condition to comparable exclusions. 
Management that is designed to contain the material or otherwise 
prevent its release to the environment, such as in a containment 
building (see 40 CFR 264.1100) or tank, is permissible. The 
Agency believes that this condition will not require any changes 
in how these secondary materials are currently managed and will 
ensure that providing regulatory relief will not unintentionally 
increase risk to human health and the environment. 
 

Additional changes were proposed and are being promulgated 
in this rule in order to implement and be consistent with the 
changes in variances discussed above. Previously the Regional 
Administrator granted variances from classification as a solid 
waste in 40 CFR 260.30, 260.31, 260.32, and 260.33. Today's rule 
transfers this authority to grant variances from the Regional 
Administrator to the Administrator. The changes in   260.30 and 
260.31 are necessary because such variances involve determining 
RCRA jurisdiction over secondary materials going to secondary 
processes. The other changes in authority to grant variances in 
  260.32 and 260.33 are being made in order to be consistent 
with the provisions of   260.30 and 260.31. 




X. Compliance Monitoring and Notification 


A. Compliance Monitoring 
 


As proposed, the Agency is adopting an approach that will 
allow generators and facilities that manage organic toxicity 
characteristic (TC) wastes in systems other than those regulated 
under the Clean Water Act (CWA), those engaged in CWA-equivalent 
treatment prior to land disposal, and those injecting into Class 
I deep injection wells, to monitor or otherwise determine the 
presence of underlying hazardous constituents ``reasonably 
expected to be present'' in their waste. (See definition at 
268.2(i).) This means that regulated entities do not have to 
ascertain the presence of all hazardous constituents for which 
EPA is promulgating a universal treatment standard. Generators 
may base this determination on their knowledge of the raw 
materials they use, the process they operate, and the potential 
reaction products of the process, or upon the results of a one-time analysis for the entire list of constituents at
 268.48. 
 

The Agency solicited comment on whether generators should be 
required to do some testing of organic TC wastes to determine 
what underlying hazardous constituents are present and whether 
they meet UTS. Furthermore, the Agency noted that generators who 
also treat (including generators who decharacterize their waste 
but do not treat for underlying hazardous constituents) are 
classified as treaters, and would therefore be required to do 
some analysis of their wastes pursuant to  268.7(b) and prepare 
a treater's certification pursuant to  268.9(d) (58 FR 48134). 
A few commenters believed that generators should have to test 
their organic TC wastes at least once. Most commenters on this 
issue, however, strongly opposed a generator testing requirement 
and said that generators should be allowed to use knowledge of 
their wastes to make such a determination. Based on these 
comments, and the Agency's reluctance to require generator 
testing of characteristic wastes but not listed wastes, the 
Agency is not imposing a testing requirement on generators of 
organic TC wastes at this time.

<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency believes, however, that certifications should identify which hazardous constituents may be present
in the waste. This is necessary in order that there be some record that the waste indeed requires treatment of these
constituents before it can be land disposed. As explained below, existing regulations already require mention of
the presence of underlying hazardous constituents in some situations. EPA is slightly amending those regulations
today to make the requirement uniform, as discussed below. 

If a generator does not treat a prohibited characteristic waste, then the generator must prepare the standard notification
and certification required by  268.7(a)(1) (for wastes that have not been treated to meet the treatment standard)
(see  268.9(d), first clause). These requirements explicitly require mention of underlying hazardous constituents
( 268.7(a)(1)(ii)). 

If a generator partially treats a waste, however, for example by decharacterizing it but not treating the underlying
hazardous constituents, there is a slight gap in the existing rules. Those rules require that a one-time notification
and certification be prepared ( 268.9(d)) and that the certification ``must state the language found in 268.7(b)(5)''
( 268.9(d)(2)). The  268.7(b)(5) certifications, however, do not contemplate the possibility that
wastes may require additional treatment for underlying hazardous constituents. To allow for this possibility,
EPA is amending  268.9(d) to state that in the event underlying hazardous constituents in a decharacterized
waste have not been fully treated, the certification shall so state. EPA is also adding the following new certification
to  268.7(b)(5) to account for this circumstance: 


 


I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 to
remove the hazardous toxicity characteristic or the characteristics of ignitability and corrosivity. This decharacterized
waste contains underlying hazardous constituents that require further treatment to meet universal treatment standards.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility
of fine and imprisonment. 



The Agency proposed, alternatively, that generators could be required to certify what underlying hazardous constituents
are in the organic TC waste and whether they meet treatment standards, in a manner similar to the existing certification
requirement for generators of wastes that meet the treatment standards as generated (see 40 CFR 268.7(a)(2)(ii))
(58 FR 48134). This suggestion was generally not supported by commenters, and EPA is not adopting this approach in
this final rule. Before considering broader changes, EPA will see if the amended requirement in  268.9(d)(2)(i)
discussed above is sufficient to create an adequate record. 



B. LDR Notification 


1. Constituents To Be Included on the LDR Notification 



EPA solicited comment on how to limit the underlying hazardous constituents that must be monitored in organic TC wastes,
and consequently reported on the LDR notification. Commenters on this issue said that the regulated community should
only be required to address those constituents which are in the organic TC wastes as generated, prior to any subsequent
mixing with other wastes. This is the approach being adopted in this rule. Such an approach is identical to the approach
adopted in the May 24, 1993 Interim Final Rule (58 FR 29873) and is supported by commenters. 

As a simplifying measure, EPA is also slightly amending the language of  268.7(a)(1)(ii) and  268.7(b)(4)(ii).
The language in these paragraphs required that the hazardous constituents in F001-F005 spent solvents, F039,
wastes subject to the California list provisions of  268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d), and underlying hazardous
constituents in characteristic wastes be listed on the LDR notification. This language is being changed so that if
all the hazardous constituents are present in the waste (and thus the generator/treater will be treating all the constituents),
then there is no longer a need to list all the constituents on the notification form. If, however, a subset of constituents
are present in the waste (and thus the generator/treater will only be treating these constituents), the constituents
in the waste must continue to be listed on the notification form. 




2. Management in Subtitle C-Regulated Facilities 

The Agency has information that many of the organic TC wastes that are not managed in CWA, or SDWA systems are being treated
in hazardous waste management units (primarily incinerators) subject to RCRA subtitle C. In such a case, the notification,
certification, and recordkeeping requirements set out in 40 CFR 268.7 apply (which includes identification of the
underlying hazardous constituents reasonably expected to be present in the organic TC waste). For organic TC wastes,
once the waste is no longer hazardous, however, further recordkeeping and documentation requirements are set out
in 40 CFR 268.9. Section 268.9 requires that the generator or treater (including generators who treat, see 51 FR 40598,
November 7, 1986) prepare a one-time notification which is sent to the EPA Region or authorized state and also kept
in the generator's or treater's files. Treaters must certify that they are familiar with the treatment process used
at their facility and that the process can successfully treat the waste to meet the treatment standards without impermissible
dilution. See  268.7(b)(5), which applies to persons who treat formerly characteristic wastes (see existing
 268.9(d)(2)). The Agency believes that, normally, at least some waste analysis is needed to make a good faith
showing for meeting the treatment standards, given the number of hazardous constituents that could be covered by
those standards. 




3. Potential Management of Decharacterized Wastes at a Subtitle D Waste Management Facility

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940919-0-00090 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Agency solicited information on certain potential waste management practices for decharacterized TC wastes
to help determine whether new notification requirements are needed. In particular, EPA requested whether generators
or treaters, after removing the characteristic, send the decharacterized TC waste off-site to a Subtitle D (nonhazardous
waste) treatment facility for further treatment to address the underlying hazardous constituents (58 FR 48134).
The Agency solicited comment on potential enforcement concerns if there is not a federal requirement that generators
notify Subtitle D treatment and disposal facilities receiving decharacterized wastes. 

One commenter stated that the generator of the waste should be made responsible through an EPA mandate to assure that
treatment of underlying hazardous constituents at a subtitle D facility meets LDR treatment standards. Other commenters
thought that the generator should notify the subtitle D facility of the underlying hazardous constituents, but they
did not specify that a mandated notification should be required. However, other commenters said that existing arrangements
between generators and off-site treatment facilities would suffice because EPA already requires generators to
notify the EPA Regional office or Authorized State when it is sending decharacterized waste to a subtitle D facility
under 40 CFR 268.9. One commenter pointed to the contract between the generator and the subtitle D facility as the mechanism
by which generators would notify the treatment facility of what underlying hazardous constituents are in the waste.


Only one commenter offered information on the extent that the practice of sending decharacterized wastes to a nonhazardous
waste treater for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents is actually occurring. This commenter asked generators
who send waste to their facilities how often they remove the characteristic prior to sending the decharacterized
waste to a nonhazardous waste treatment facility for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents. They found
that roughly 2-3 percent of the wastes from their survey group were decharacterized D001 and D002 wastes being
sent off-site for further treatment at a nonhazardous waste treatment facility that employs CWA wastewater treatment
or stabilization of underlying hazardous constituents. The commenter added, however, that there will be less decharacterized
TC wastes going off-site for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents because these wastes require more sophisticated
treatment systems to remove the characteristic than do the D001 and D002 wastes. 

Based on this information, the Agency has decided, for the time being, not to impose new notification requirements
in today's final rule (a new certification is being added in this rule to  268.7(b)(5)(iv) as described above).
The Agency continues to believe that very little decharacterized TC wastes will be sent to a subtitle D facility for
treatment of underlying hazardous constituents. If such a practice should occur, generators and Subtitle D facilities
have substantial incentives (such as CERCLA liability) to exchange and verify compliance with treatment standards
for underlying hazardous constituents independent of federal notification requirements. 

If, however, information becomes available that generators are sending substantial amounts of decharacterized
TC wastes off site to subtitle D facilities for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, or that there is a
paperwork loophole that existing arrangements between generators and treatment facilities do not address, today's
approach will be revisited to determine whether such tracking is necessary to assure ``cradle to grave'' tracking
of wastes and better informing subtitle D treatment and disposal companies of the requirements to which these decharacterized
wastes remain subject. 



XI. Implementation of the Final Rule 



This section presents flowcharts of what EPA expects will be the most frequent set of decisions that must be made to
implement the regulations for TC organic wastes (including soils), mixtures of TC organic wastes with listed wastes,
and mixtures of TC organic wastes with ignitable or corrosive wastes. A flowchart describing the decisions necessary
to comply with treatment standards for Phase II newly listed wastes is also included. Additionally, a flowchart is
presented that outlines the decisions necessary to comply with treatment standards for debris contaminated with
Phase II wastes. And, as a reminder that TC metals are not regulated by today's rule, a flowchart is also included of
the decisions that must be made to determine if a characteristic metal waste is subject to the LDRs at this time based
on regulation of Extraction Procedure (EP) metals in the Third Third rule in 1990, or is not yet subject to LDR regulation
because TC metals will not be addressed until a later rulemaking. These flowcharts present only the major decisions
that must be made; a thorough reading of the regulations will be necessary to fully implement the LDRs. There are requirements
for specific waste management scenarios that are not included in these flowcharts because they would have become
too complex to be generally useful.

XII. Guidance to Applicants for Treatability Variances for As- 
Generated Wastes 



The Agency's existing regulations provide for variances 
from treatment standards if a waste cannot be treated to the 
specified treatment standard or if the treatment technology on 
which the standard is based is inappropriate for the waste. 
Section 268.44 (a). For guidance on treatability variances for 
soil, including site-specific, non-rulemaking variances, see 
section I.E. ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Soil'' in this 
rule. To be granted a treatability variance, a petitioner must 
show that ``because the physical or chemical properties of the 
waste differs significantly from wastes analyzed in developing 
the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified 
levels or by the specified methods.'' 

Id.

 A demonstration that 
the waste cannot be successfully treated can be made ``by showing 
that attempts to treat the waste by available technologies were 
not successful, or through appropriate analyses of the waste 
which demonstrate that the waste cannot be treated to the 
specified levels.'' 51 FR at 40606 (Nov. 7, 1986). EPA evaluates 
treatability variance requests by ``first look[ing] at the design 
and operation of the treatment system being used. If EPA 
determines that the technology and operation are consistent with 
BDAT, the Agency will evaluate the waste to determine if the 
waste matrix and/or physical parameters are such [that] the BDAT 
properly reflects treatment of the waste.'' 

Id.

 The guidance set 
out below applies exclusively to treatability variances (for as-generated wastes) evaluated by EPA headquarters
and processed 
pursuant to rulemaking procedures. 

In order to settle a lawsuit challenging the Agency's grant 
of treatability variances to two particular facilities, 56 FR 
12351 (March 25, 1991), the Agency has agreed to provide some 
clarifying guidance regarding treatability variances, which 
essentially restates existing Agency practice and does not call 
into question the validity of any treatability variance the 
Agency has issued. First, as stated in 1986, to support an 
application for a treatability variance pursuant to  268.44(a) 
for process waste, the applicant should collect and analyze a 
sufficient number of samples of the untreated waste to accurately 
characterize it. 51 FR at 40606 (Nov. 7, 1986). In general, the 
Agency would expect the applicant to collect and analyze four 
samples of its untreated and treated waste. (This corresponds to 
the minimum number of samples applicants for delisting pursuant 
to 260.20 must submit.) However, the exact number of samples 
would be determined by EPA as part of the Agency's evaluation of 
each treatability variance application (and so could be less than 
four samples in a particular case). 

Second, the applicant should normally investigate and 
report on demonstrated and reasonably available pretreatment 
steps that could significantly improve the effectiveness of the 
treatment the applicant is conducting. 51 FR at 40606. What the 
Agency has in mind is that applicants not overlook potentially 
simple types of pretreatment to remove an interfering parameter; 
for example, settling to reduce excess total dissolved solids. 
The Agency does not intend that applicants perform an extensive 
or expansive engineering analysis. Nor does the Agency intend 
that applicants be required to utilize treatment systems 
significantly different from those the Agency evaluated when 
promulgating the treatment standard. Rather, the Agency wishes 
to assure that applicants not overlook some relatively obvious 
means of removing interferences. Again, in particular cases, it 
may not make sense to conduct this type of analysis, in which 
case no such evaluation would be necessary. 

Third, the applicant should make a good faith effort to 
explain why the treatment standard is not achievable for its 
waste. 51 FR at 40606. This good faith effort is to be based on 
the applicant's knowledge of its process, and is not to entail 
additional expense (such as a consultant's engineering analysis). 
As a general matter, the Agency simply believes that some thought 
should be given (and documented) as to what might be causing the 
problem. 

Finally, EPA's general policy has been and will be to 
publish a notice of its proposed decision on applications for 
treatability variances in the 

Federal Register

,  261.44 (e), and 
to allow a minimum of 30 days for the public to comment on the 
proposal. 51 FR 40607. All applicants will have the opportunity 
to comment on the reasonableness of applying one or more of these 
foregoing statements of guidance to their applications, and, as a 
result, EPA may decide not to apply them.

EPA notes further that there have been only a handful (fewer than 10) of applications for treatability variances since
implementation of the land ban (aside from applications relating to contaminated media and debris), of which EPA
has granted three. In the applications relating to electroplating wastes cited earlier, the Agency inferred that
something about the applicants' wastes was making the wastes more difficult to treat than the waste EPA evaluated
when promulgating the applicable treatment standard. This inference was based on the fact that the applicants were
treating the waste with properly designed and operated BDAT treatment technology, namely the same type of treatment
technology on which the treatment standard is based. 56 FR at 12352. EPA emphasizes that this type of inference was,
and remains, permissible.


XIII. Clarifications and Corrections to Previous Rules


A. Corrections to the Interim Final Rule Establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Certain Ignitable and Corrosive
Wastes


On May 24, 1993, the EPA published an interim final rule establishing treatment standards for ignitable and corrosive
characteristic wastes except those disposed in facilities regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), or Class I injection
wells subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or zero-discharge facilities engaged in CWA-equivalent treatment.
In today's rule, the Agency is clarifying that the provisions of the interim final rule remain in effect unless and
until they are superseded in future LDR rules. The Agency does not plan to issue a final rule at this time; however, it
is using the comments received on the interim final rule in developing future rules concerning the portions of the
Third Third Land Disposal Restrictions Rule which were remanded by the D.C. Circuit (for discussion of the court ruling,
see 58 FR 29861).
Among other things, the interim final rule established treatment standards for the underlying hazardous constituents
reasonably expected to be present in the affected wastes at the point of generation. These treatment standards were
the concentration levels for the constituents found in F039 (multisource leachate) wastewaters and nonwastewaters.
The Agency is clarifying here that the universal treatment standards (UTS) established today supersede the F039
standards. Therefore, underlying hazardous constituents in the ignitable and corrosive wastes covered by the interim
final rule must meet the 40 CFR 268.48, Table UTS_Universal Treatment Standards, levels before they can be land disposed.
This change is being made simply so that the references to treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents
in ignitable and corrosive wastes in the interim final rule will be the same as those established for organic TC wastes
in today's rule.
Also in the interim final rule, the Agency promulgated requirements to address a concern raised by the court about
the potential for volatile organic constituent (VOC) emissions to create violent reactions during the dilution
of ignitable and reactive wastes (see 58 FR 29873). The regulatory language in   264.1(g)(6) and 265.1(c)(10),
however, inadvertently promulgated requirements for ignitable (D001) wastes and corrosive (D002) wastes. These
sections are being corrected in today's rule to indicate, rightly, that the requirements apply to ignitable (D001)
and reactive (D003) wastes.


B. Corrections to the Phase I Rule Establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Newly Listed Wastes and Hazardous
Debris


Today's rule clarifies several issues from the final rule establishing Land Disposal Restrictions for Newly Listed
Wastes and Hazardous Debris (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992).
The first issue being corrected responds to questions over which treatment standards can be used for treating hazardous
debris. It was stated clearly in the preamble to the August 18, 1992 rule that debris must be treated by either using
one of the specified technologies in  268.45, or, as an alternative, by meeting LDRs for the specific prohibited
listed or characteristic waste with which the debris is contaminated (57 FR 37221). Subsequent comment from the regulated
community indicate that this fact was not made completely clear in the regulatory language of that rule. Certain commenters
suggested that a revision of the paperwork requirements found in  268.7 indicating that generators have a choice
as to which treatment standards they may use would help alleviate the confusion.
EPA is, therefore, revising  268.7(a)(1)(iv) and  268.7(a)(3)(v) to reflect that it is not mandatory
to meet the alternative debris standards in  268.45, and that generators have the option to meet the treatment
standards for the as-generated wastes contaminating the debris. It should be noted that the paperwork requirements
for meeting treatment standards for as-generated wastes contaminating debris are the same as those for as-generated
wastes. A new paragraph is being added to the regulatory language to indicate this.
In addition, consistent with EPA's effort to simplify LDR paperwork requirements, EPA is shortening the notification
statement accompanying prohibited debris. In  268.7(a)(1)(iv) and  268.7(a)(3)(v), as promulgated
on August 18, 1992, the statement ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40
CFR 268.45'' was required to be placed on the LDR notification, after listing the contaminants subject to treatment.
EPA is revising that particular statement today so that merely referencing  268.45 after listing the contaminants
subject to treatment is all that must be included on the LDR notification.

<DOCNO> FR940919-0-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The second issue the Agency wishes to clarify and correct today concerns the language in  268.45(b)(2) of the
August 18, 1992 

Federal Register

. This section states that the contaminants subject to the alternative treatment standards for hazardous debris,
which were promulgated in the August 18, 1992 rule, are those constituents for which BDAT standards are established
in   
268.41 and 268.43. The Agency has received several letters asking why section 268.42 was not included in that language.
Section 268.42 lists those wastes for which EPA established a treatment method as the standard. The reason section
268.42 was not included in the language in  268.45(b)(2) is that only the wastes themselves, and not waste constituents,
are listed in  
268.42.
The Agency fully intends, however, that debris contaminated with those wastes be subject to the alternate debris
standards. Therefore,  268.45(b)(2) is being clarified today to read ``The contaminants subject to treatment
for debris that is contaminated with a prohibited listed hazardous waste are those constituents or wastes for which
BDAT standards are established for the wastes under   268.41, 268.42, and 268.43.''
The third issue the Agency is clarifying concerns exactly when surface impoundments which are newly subject to RCRA
section 3005(j)(1) are expected to be in compliance with the requirements of  265.221 (a), (c), and (d). As is
stated in  268.5(h)(2)(v) (as promulgated at 57 FR 37270, August 18, 1992), such surface impoundments must
be in compliance within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for the identification
of hazardous waste. This is the maximum time allowed by RCRA section 3005(j)(6).
EPA mistakenly stated in two separate places in the preamble to the August 18, 1992 rule that the compliance date was
48 months from the effective date of a waste identification or listing (57 FR 37220). The Agency wants to make it clear
that the compliance date which was promulgated in the regulations, and which is mandated by RCRA 3005(j)(6), is correct
(57 FR 37270). These surface impoundments are thus required to be in compliance 48 months from the promulgation date
of a new identification or listing.  268.5(h)(2)(v).
The promulgation date is the date the Administrator signs the rule which lists the new waste(s). The effective date
is the date the new waste must come into compliance with hazardous waste management requirements, and may be six months
from the promulgation date. The Agency believes that 48 months to retrofit a surface impoundment is a reasonable amount
of time, and believes that effort should begin as soon as the listing of a waste is published in the 

Federal Register

; there is no reason to wait to begin retrofitting until a new listing or identification actually becomes effective.
In any case, section 3005(j)(6) allows no other option.
Finally, in  268.38(a) of this rule, EPA is prohibiting debris that is contaminated with the wastes that were
prohibited in the Phase I rule. EPA inadvertently omitted to include such contaminated debris in the August 18, 1992
rule.


C. Amendment of Boiler and Industrial Furnace Rules for Certain Mercury-Containing Wastes


1. The Proposal


The Agency proposed a technical clarification to the Boiler and Industrial Furnace (BIF) rules on July 21, 1994 (59
FR 31964), that would exempt certain mercury-bearing hazardous wastes generated by the Chlorine Industry from the
provisions of 266.100(c). Under this provision, owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces
that process hazardous wastes solely for metal recovery are conditionally exempt from regulation. To be exempt,
the owner or operator must comply with certain notification, sampling and analysis, and recordkeeping provisions
(see 266.100(c)(1)(i)). In addition, as indicated above, the waste must be processed solely for metal recovery;
to be processed solely for metal recovery, the waste can not have a heating value greater than 5000 BTU/lb or have a total
concentration of organic compounds listed in Appendix VIII of Part 261 greater than 500 ppm by weight. Wastes that
have a heating value greater than 5000 BTU/lb or have a total concentration of hazardous organic compounds exceeding
500 ppm are considered by EPA to be burned for energy recovery and destruction, respectively and, thus, are subject
to the BIF rules.
The Agency generally believes that most wastes that meet these criteria are appropriately subject to the BIF regulations.
However, in certain instances, wastes that are burned for legitimate metal recovery can also exceed the 5000 BTU/lb
and 500 ppm organic compound limits, in which case standards other than those in the BIF rules are likely more appropriate.
(See 59 FR at 29776 (June 9, 1994) proposing CAA MACT standards for secondary lead smelters and indicating why RCRA
air emission standards are not needed.) In fact, the Agency has specified a set of lead and nickel-bearing hazardous
wastes that exceed the energy recovery or destruction limits, but are still conditionally exempt from the BIF rules
if these wastes are legitimately burned for metal recovery (see 266.100(c)(3) and Appendices XI and XII to Part 266).
In the proposed technical clarification, the Agency defined some additional hazardous wastes_specifically, those
generated by the Chlorine Industry and which are suitable for mercury recovery_that could be recovered in mercury
retorting units without those units being subject to the BIF rules (provided the owners or operators of these units
meet certain conditions). The Agency proposed this change based on the fact that these wastes contain high levels
of mercury (from hundreds of parts per million to as much as 45%) and, thus are appropriate for recovery; in addition,
the retort units in which these wastes are processed must be subject to emissions controls under the Clean Air Act.
See  268.42 (treatment standards for high mercury subcategory wastes that require retorting units to be subject
to the CAA or comparable standards for control of mercury). It should also be noted that the Chlorine Institute, as
part of their comments on the Phase II LDR proposal, requested that the Agency exempt these wastes from the BIFs rules.
The remainder of this section of the preamble discusses the comments received and our response to those comments.

2. Comments and the Final Rule


The Agency received comments from five parties, Borden Chemical and Plastics (BCP), Bethlehem Apparatus (BA), PPG
Industries (PPG), Olin Chemicals (Olin), and the Chlorine Institute (CI). Their collective comments and the Agency's
response follows.
The proposal limited the conditional exemption to certain mercury-bearing hazardous wastes generated by the Chlorine
Institute. BCP, BA, and CI argued that the proposed change was too narrow, and that other mercury recovery units may
also process combustible materials for legitimate metals recovery. Commenters thus recommended that the exemption
should apply to all processors of mercury wastes. The Agency generally agrees with this position. Upon reevaluation,
EPA believes there is no need to differentiate between units in the Chlorine Industry and similar units outside the
Chlorine Industry. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating a rule which includes units operated by manufacturers
and users of mercury or mercury products.
BCP addressed a second option for broadening the exemption so that devices other than those operated in the Chlorine
Industry could process combustible wastes for legitimate metals recovery. BCP suggested EPA define mercury as a
precious metal and allow processors to burn mercury laden hazardous wastes subject to the Agency's BIF precious metals
exemption (see  266.100(f)). EPA does not agree with BCP's contention that mercury is a precious metal. Mercury
is not considered a precious metal by EPA or other Agencies or organizations. Precious metals are defined by the Bureau
of Mines to include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium (Mineral Commodity Summary, 1993), and by EPA at 40 CFR 266.70
to include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium, all metals whose value assures
adequate control. Therefore, EPA rejects the approach suggested by BCP.
BCP, PPG, Olin, and CI also commented that the list of materials in the proposed technical clarification should be
broadened to include the following additional items:



Sweepings
Respiratory Cartridge Filters
Cleanup Articles
Plastic Bags and Other Contaminated Containers
Laboratory and Process Control Samples
Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge and Filter Cake
Mercury cell process sump and tank sludges
Mercury cell process solids
K106
Recoverable levels of mercury contained in soil



Upon evaluation, the Agency agrees that of these materials are appropriate for an exemption as long as they have recoverable
levels of mercury. However, many mercury units, e.g., retorters, are not combustion devices and organic emissions
may not be controlled in these units. Therefore, the Agency is concerned that materials with recoverable levels of
mercury, but laden with hazardous organics, may not provide adequate destruction of the hazardous organics in exempt
retorters, and thus, may not be protective of human health and the environment. For that reason, the Agency is promulgating
a broadened list of materials but is limiting the exemption to these wastes specifically identified and that contain
less than 500 ppm of part 261, appendix VIII organics.


Finally, there appears to be some confusion by the Chlorine Industry about their status under the BIF rules (collectively,
those regulations set forth in 40 CFR Part 266, Subpart H). CI, PPG, and Olin argued that they are not subject to BIF because
they do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' anything and the BIF rules are written for combustion devices. The Agency agrees
that many mercury recovery devices do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' by design; however, these units are Industrial
Furnaces as defined in  
260.10 and, thus, are subject to the appropriate BIF rules. In particular,  260.10 defines Industrial Furnaces
as ``devices * * * that use 

thermal treatment 

to accomplish recovery of materials'' and that these include ``refining furnaces''. [Emphasis added.] Mercury
recovery units raise the temperature of the waste to aid in the recovery and refining of mercury. Therefore, they are
refining furnaces. In addition,  266.100(c) states that ``smelting, melting and refining furnaces * * *
that 

process 

hazardous waste solely for metals recovery are conditionally exempt * * *.'' [Emphasis added.] This
language includes all refining furnaces that 

process 


hazardous waste, irrespective of whether the process to achieve this end is combustion or not. Therefore, mercury
recovery devices are BIFs, and come within the terms of  266.100(c). EPA is using the term ``mercury recovery
furnace'' in today's amended rule to further clarify this point. (It should be noted that compliance with the BIF rules
for these devices are not rigorous. It requires sending a one time written notification to the regional Director and
following the provisions set forth in  266.100(c).)
Mercury recovery operators should note that the changes discussed in this section of the preamble only apply to units
which have a metals recovery exemption. Units which process these wastes without the proper exemption are in violation
of the BIF rules and subject to enforcement action.


D. Amendment of Rules on Use Constituting Disposal


In 1985, EPA created a separate regulatory regime for hazardous wastes that are recycled by being used in a manner constituting
disposal. Part 266 subpart C.
 These rules provide, in essence, that the wastes can be so used without being subject to the RCRA facility standards
if the waste-derived product (i.e. the hazardous wastes that is being used by being applied to the land (i.e. used in
a manner constituting disposal)) has been ``produced for the general public's use,'' has undergone a chemical change
so as to be inseparable by physical means, and if it meets the applicable LDR treatment standard. See  266.20(b).

<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Hazardous wastes used in a manner constituting disposal that do not satisfy these conditions are subject to all of
the subtitle C standards. See  266.23(a). In promulgating this provision in 1985, however, the Agency neglected
to mention the then newly-enacted land disposal restriction requirements as among the standards to which the wastes
were subject. The Agency obviously was not intending to amend the statute, and cannot override an express statutory
requirement by regulation. The Agency only recently noticed this omission, and is using this opportunity to correct
the error. Consequently, the Part 268 requirements will be added to the list of requirements in  266.23(a) for
those hazardous wastes not satisfying the conditions of  266.20(b). This amendment is effective 90 days after
publication of today's rule.


XIV. Capacity Determinations


This section presents the data sources, methodology, and results of EPA's capacity analysis for today's rule. Section
A summarizes the results of the capacity analysis for the wastes covered by this rule; Section B summarizes the analysis
of available capacity; Section C summarizes the capacity analysis for those newly identified and listed wastes that
are land disposed in units other than deep injection wells; Section D summarizes the capacity analysis for wastes
mixed with radioactive contaminants; Section E summarizes the results of the capacity analysis for high TOC ignitable
and TC pesticide wastes and newly listed and identified wastes injected into Class I deep wells; and Section F presents
the results of the capacity analysis for hazardous soil and debris contaminated with the newly listed and identified
wastes covered in this rule.
In general, EPA's capacity analysis methodologies focus on the amount of waste currently land disposed that will
require alternative commercial treatment as a result of the LDRs. Land-disposed wastes that do not require alternative
commercial treatment (e.g., those that are currently treated using an appropriate treatment technology or that
will be treated using an alternative on-site treatment system) are excluded from the quantity estimates. In addition,
wastes managed in CWA, SDWA, CWA-equivalent systems are not included in this rule and will be addressed in an upcoming
rulemaking.
EPA's decisions on whether to grant a national capacity variance are based on the demand for commercial treatment
or recovery technologies. Consequently, the methodology focuses on deriving estimates of the quantity of wastes
that will require commercial treatment as a result of the LDRs; quantities of waste that will be treated on-site or
by facilities owned by the same company as the generator are omitted from the required commercial capacity estimates.
The major capacity information collection initiative for this rule was an EPA survey of all land disposal facilities
that manage newly identified TC organic wastes (including TC-contaminated soil and debris) in land-based units
(TC Survey). The survey, conducted in the spring of 1992, is a census of approximately 140 facilities. EPA identified
the universe primarily based on those facilities that had submitted permit modifications or received interim status
for managing these wastes. For each facility, EPA requested waste-stream specific data on newly identified TC organic
wastes and information on on-site land disposal units and treatment and recovery systems.
EPA developed a data set of the information on the TC Survey results. Specifically, the data set contains information
on the quantities of newly-identified organic TC wastes that will require commercial treatment capacity as a result
of the LDRs. The data collected and the survey used for the required capacity estimates are part of the docket for today's
final rule.


A. Capacity Analysis Results Summary


For the organic TC wastes (D018-D043), EPA estimates that 220,000 tons of newly identified organic TC sludges
and solids will require alternative commercial treatment as a result of today's final rule.
EPA estimates that much smaller quantities of the other listed wastes included in today's rule will require alternative
commercial treatment. Fewer than 100 tons of chlorinated toluene (K149-K151) nonwastewaters are currently
being land disposed and will require alternative treatment due to the LDRs. Approximately 4,600 tons of coke by-product
(K141-K145, K147 and K148) nonwastewaters are currently being land disposed. However, comments to EPA indicate
that the majority of the nonwastewaters are recycled or used for energy recovery and, therefore, alternative treatment
may not be required. No K141-K145, K147 and K148 wastewaters are currently being land disposed. No K149-K151
wastewaters are currently being land disposed.
The quantities of radioactive wastes mixed with wastes included in today's final rule and currently being land disposed
are generated primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). EPA estimates that 1,300 m3 of high-level waste, 380
m3 of mixed transuranic waste, and 1,100 m3 of mixed low-level waste containing wastes covered in today's rule will
be generated annually by DOE. These estimates exclude mixed wastes currently in storage, environmental restoration
wastes, and soil and debris. DOE currently faces treatment capacity shortfalls for some high-level wastes and for
all projected mixed transuranic waste generation. In addition, although the annual DOE treatment capacity for mixed
low-level wastes exceeds the estimated annual generation, most of this capacity is limited to treatment of wastewaters
with less than one percent total suspended solids, and is not readily adaptable for other waste forms. Consequently,
DOE also faces a treatment capacity shortfall for mixed low-level nonwastewaters. Furthermore, DOE has indicated
that it will generally give treatment priority to mixed wastes that are already restricted under previous LDR rules.
With respect to certain wastes being injected into deep wells, EPA has very limited information that differentiates
high TOC D001 ignitable wastes from low TOC D001 ignitable wastes, particularly with reference to the type of Class
I injection well (i.e., nonhazardous versus hazardous) the wastes are ultimately disposed into. The information
the Agency does have indicates that both D001 ignitable wastes and D012-D017 TC pesticide wastes are deep well
injected into Class I hazardous wells with no-migration exemptions. However, several commenters to the proposed
rule, and other industries with Class I injection wells, indicated that it would be extremely difficult to identify,
segregate, treat, and/or arrange for disposal of these waste streams in a short time frame. Consequently, EPA is granting
these wastes a one-year national capacity variance.
The Agency also estimates that up to 120,000 tons of hazardous soil and 34,000 tons of hazardous debris contaminated
with the newly identified organic TC wastes are expected to require alternative commercial treatment.
Table 1 lists each waste code for which EPA is promulgating LDR standards today. For each code, this table indicates
whether EPA is granting a national capacity variance for land-disposed wastes. As indicated, EPA is not granting
a two-year national capacity variance for the newly identified organic TC wastes, including soil and debris, nor
for the listed wastes covered under this rule. Rather, EPA is granting a three-month variance. (This extension does
not apply to wastes with a specified longer national capacity variance.) EPA is delaying the effective date because
the Agency realizes that even where data indicate that sufficient treatment capacity exists, such capacity may not
be immediately available. Additional time may be required to determine what compliance entails, redesign tracking
documents, possibly adjust facility operations, and possibly segregate waste streams. EPA believes these legitimate
delays can be encompassed within a short-term capacity variance because the ability to get wastes to the treatment
capacity in a lawful manner is an inherent part of assessing available capacity. However, the Agency is granting a
two-year national capacity variance for mixed radioactive wastes (i.e., radioactive wastes mixed with newly identified
TC organic constituents D018-D043), including soil and debris contaminated with mixed radioactive wastes.
EPA also is granting a one-year national capacity variance to allow the Class I injection facilities an appropriate
lead time to identify and then manage their high TOC D001 and D012-D017 waste streams by developing practical
and sound treatment and/or disposal options and ultimately to come into compliance with today's rule.

B. Analysis of Available Capacity



The analysis of commercial capacity for newly identified and listed wastes is based primarily on data received in
voluntary data submissions. These data include estimates of available capacity at commercial combustion facilities
provided by the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC) on incinerators and the Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition
(CKRC) on cement kilns that burn hazardous wastes. Capacity for other conventional treatment processes (e.g., stabilization)
is based on the 1990 TSDR Survey Capacity Data Set, which contains results from the National Survey of Hazardous Waste
Treatment, Storage, Disposal and Recycling Survey (the TSDR Survey), and required capacity information from prior
LDR rules.



Combustion Capacity.

 Combustion capacity for liquid hazardous wastes has historically been more readily available than capacity for
sludges and solids. EPA estimates commercial combustion capacity for TC organic liquids to be about 1,267,000 tons
per year. Commercial capacity for combustion of sludges and solids is available at both incinerators and industrial
furnaces (primarily cement kilns that are authorized to burn hazardous wastes as fuel).

Cement kiln capacity for hazardous waste is limited by air emission limits (e.g., boiler and industrial furnace (BIF)
limits under 40 CFR 266 subpart H), feed system limitations (e.g., particle size and viscosity limits), and product
(i.e., cement clinker) quality considerations. For instance, cement quality considerations may require that wastes
burned in cement kilns have a heating value of at least 5,000 BTU/lb to ensure adequate temperatures in the kiln. (Comments
received by EPA, however, indicate that some kilns accept wastes below this heating value.) Incineration capacity
is also limited by air emission limits, other permit limits (such as heat release limits), and feed system limits.
EPA has taken these limitations into account in its estimates of available commercial combustion capacity.

Information available to EPA indicates that approximately 438,000 tons/year of commercial combustion capacity
are available for newly identified TC organic sludges and solids, including soil and debris.
 EPA primarily derived this estimate primarily from survey data compiled by the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council
(HWTC) and Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition (CKRC). These surveys contained detailed information on the amount and
types of waste burned at each commercial facility in 1992, and the maximum amount of waste that could practically be
burned in light of technical, operational, and regulatory constraints. In deriving this estimate, EPA first reviewed
each survey response to confirm that the information provided was based on technically valid assumptions. To be conservative
in its national estimate, EPA only included facilities and units that are presently capable of operating at or near
full capacity under current permit and operational constraints. EPA then derived a national baseline estimate of
available capacity by subtracting the amount of waste (hazardous and nonhazardous) burned in 1992 from the maximum
practical capacity at each facility. Several cement kilns that burn hazardous waste were not included in the CKRC
survey results. For these facilities, EPA obtained maximum practical capacity estimates from other sources (e.g.,
past data submittals or general trade literature), and derived available capacity estimates by assuming that these
kilns are utilized at the average rate of those included in the CKRC survey. EPA's methodology for deriving its baseline
capacity estimate is described in greater detail in the capacity background document for today's rule.





Once EPA obtained its baseline available commercial combustion capacity estimate, it estimated available capacity
for wastes affected by today's rule by subtracting required capacity for routinely generated F037 and F038 (69,000
tons/year) from its baseline estimate. This adjustment was needed because these wastes were not regulated during
most of the 1992 base year (refer to 57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992). EPA did not adjust its capacity estimate to account
for one-time generation of F037 and F038 because the Agency understands that these wastes were generally removed
prior to the June 1994 effective date of the LDR standards or are being left in place when the surface impoundments that
contain them are being closed.

EPA's estimate of available capacity takes into account capacity that will be required for Phase I wastes that were
granted a national capacity variance, ignitable and corrosive wastes whose treatment standards were vacated (58
FR 29860, May 24, 1993), waste characteristics that affect the ability for a particular facility(s) to treat the wastes,
and other factors that may limit capacity.

EPA is also considering the capacity effects of recent court decisions regarding the regulation of hazardous constituents
other than those for which the waste fails the TC test. EPA solicited comments on the treatment capacity effects of
requiring facilities to treat the underlying hazardous constituents in TC organic hazardous wastes to meet the then-proposed
universal treatment standards. Although several commenters submitted comments in support of or in opposition to
requirements for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, few comments were received on the specific issue
of the effects of this requirement on treatment capacity. EPA has concluded that sufficient combustion capacity
exists to treat underlying hazardous organic constituents. One commenter indicated that few facilities could achieve
the universal treatment standards (UTS) for some metals (which may be present as underlying constituents) in incinerator
ash without further treatment. However, EPA believes that stabilization should generally be able to achieve the
UTS levels for metal underlying constituents present in residuals from the treatment of organic TC wastes.



Stabilization Capacity

. Stabilization may be required to treat the residuals of wastes covered in today's rule that contain metal underlying
constituents. EPA estimates that over 1 million tons of stabilization capacity is currently available. In analyzing
alternative treatment capacity for stabilization of newly identified and listed wastes, the Agency built on the
capacity analysis conducted for the Third Third LDR rule. This analysis was based on data contained in the TSDR Capacity
Data Set.



Innovative (Non-combustion) Technologies

. There are several non-combustion technologies for the treatment of soil contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes,
including hydrolysis, vacuum extraction, photolysis, and oxidation. To the extent that these technologies can
be used to treat hazardous soil on-site, the required capacity for combustion will decrease.

EPA has limited information on innovative technologies with regard to both available capacity and to limitations
of the technologies or constraints on the use of these technologies. EPA solicited comments on the use of innovative
technologies for the treatment of soil contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes. Specifically, EPA requested information
regarding constraints on the use of these technologies both on- and off-site, including physical or chemical characteristics
of the soils, and logistical constraints such as permitting and scheduling. EPA also solicited data on volumes of
contaminated soil currently being treated by these technologies, current available capacity, and estimates of
future capacity. EPA received two comments regarding innovative technologies. One commenter noted that to treat
soil on-site requires permitting and approval by local, state, and federal agencies, which may be a problem for some
innovative technologies. Another commenter stated that the chemical concentration to which a soil can be biotreated
is influenced by the particular chemical, the soil type, the age of the contaminated media, and the bioremediation
process. EPA encourages the use of innovative technologies when feasible, and realizes that_in some cases_use of
these technologies may be limited by technical and non-technical considerations. Sufficient conventional treatment
capacity is available, however, such that these limitations do not affect capacity determinations. 



C. Surface Disposed Newly Identified and Listed Wastes 



1. Required Capacity for Newly Identified TC Organics (D018-D043)



The Agency is promulgating treatment standards for TC organic nonwastewaters based primarily on incineration performance
data. Treatment standards for some newly identified organic TC wastewaters are also being promulgated in today's
rule. (Organic TC wastewaters managed in systems regulated under the CWA, those injected into Class I injection wells
as regulated under the SDWA, and those zero discharge facilities that engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to
land disposal will be addressed in future rulemakings. EPA will make variance determinations for these wastes at
that time.) For the proposed rule, the Agency did not have data indicating that facilities managing organic TC wastewaters
would be impacted. Thus, EPA solicited comments in the proposed rule on the quantities of newly identified organic
TC wastewaters affected by the rule. However, no comments were received on this issue. The Agency has concluded that
facilities managing organic TC wastewaters will not be affected by this rule (i.e., no organic TC wastewaters will
likely require alternative commercial treatment as a result of today's rule).

EPA developed estimates of the quantities of newly identified TC organic wastes based on current management options
to comply with the LDR requirements. EPA did not receive any data in public comments on the quantities of organic TC
nonwastewaters containing underlying metal constituents. EPA estimates that approximately 220,000 tons of organic
TC nonwastewaters are subject to this rule. (See Table 2 which presents the quantities of TC nonwastewaters (except
for liquid nonwastewaters) requiring off-site treatment by waste code.) Even if all this quantity contained underlying
metal constituents, the residuals from the treatment of organics could not be higher than 220,000 tons. Underlying
metal constituents are, by definition, at levels that are below TC levels for metals. Stabilization is an appropriate
technology for treating low level metal wastes. Given that ample treatment capacity exists for stabilization (over
1 million tons), EPA believes that sufficient treatment capacity exists for residuals of organic TC wastes containing
underlying metal constituents.

<TEXT>
 




The Agency also developed estimates of available commercial treatment capacity. Table 3 summarizes available capacity
for each alternative treatment technology required for the newly identified TC nonwastewaters. The table also summarizes
the required capacity for each technology. A comparison of required and available treatment capacity indicates
that adequate combustion capacity exists for TC nonwastewaters. Therefore, in the proposed rule, EPA indicated
they would not be granting a national capacity variance for D018-D043 nonwastewaters. EPA requested comments
and any additional data on its assessment that there is adequate treatment capacity for these wastes. EPA received
one comment on this issue. The commenter supported EPA's determination that sufficient capacity exists to treat
D018-D043 nonwastewaters. Thus, EPA has not changed its assessment and is not granting a variance for these
nonwastewaters.

2. Used Oil


EPA's capacity assessment does not include specific quantities of used oil which might be subject to this rule. Absent
data to the contrary, EPA believes that the quantities of used oil that are land disposed and hazardous for TC organics
are relatively small. (Used oil that is recycled and that exhibits the TC is not subject to the land disposal restrictions.
See 261.6(a)(4).)
EPA has requested information and conducted various studies of generation, management and characteristics of used
oil. Although the data are not comprehensive, based on all indications, most used oil is either recycled or reused
as fuel.
In its May 20, 1992 (57 FR 21524) final listing determination for used oil, the Agency concluded that only a small portion
of used oil is land disposed (less than 10 percent of the amount generated). Although in general used oil could be hazardous
for TC organics (benzene) and metals (lead), the Agency furthermore observed that the trend of increased recycling
and the phase down of lead in gasoline under the Clean Air Act would decrease both the quantity of used oil that is land
disposed and the proportion of it that is hazardous.
To update and refine its capacity analysis for this rule, EPA requested comments in the September 14, 1993 proposed
rule (58 FR 48092) and reviewed available data sources. The Agency requested comments on the quantities of used oil
that exhibit the toxicity characteristic and is subject to the LDRs. EPA received only one comment from a firm that
collected over 113 million gallons of used oil for re-refining in 1992, but did not receive any comments on the amounts
of used oil subject to the LDRs.
To gain a broader perspective of used oil generation and management EPA examined 1991 data from the national Biennial
Reporting System (BRS). EPA did not expect to obtain comprehensive total quantities of hazardous used oil generation
and management; however, EPA was able to get the proportional management of reported waste oils. The BRS shows that
less than one percent of all waste oil reported is landfilled. For example, in the `waste oil from changes' category
of the 1991 BRS, approximately 1,400 tons was reported as landfilled. Although EPA believes the proportionate disposal
(percent) is nationally representative, the total quantity was reported for waste streams from only a few states
which indicates that the total is not comprehensive.
We have received preliminary data from the State of New Jersey Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Commission. New
Jersey treats used oil as state hazardous waste and the Commission tracks generation and shipping/manifest data.
In the oil category, approximately 1 percent of used oil generated is identified as land disposed (landfilled). Of
this 1 percent we do not know how much would be hazardous for TC organics.
Therefore, EPA believes that the quantities of used oil that are land disposed and are also hazardous for TC organics
are small and sufficient reuse-as-fuel, energy recovery, and/or incineration capacity exists. EPA believes that
a capacity variance is not warranted for these wastes.


3. Required Capacity for Other Newly Listed Organic Wastes


This section presents EPA's analysis of required capacity for other listed organic wastes including coke by-product
wastes and chlorinated toluene production wastes.


a. Surface Disposed Coke By-Product Wastes


K141_Process residues from the recovery of coal tar, including, but not limited to, tar collecting sump residues
from the production of coke from coal or the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal. This listing does not
include K087 (decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations).
K142_Tar storage tank residues from the production of coke from coal or the recovery of coke by-products produced
from coal.
K143_Process residues from the recovery of light oil, including, but not limited to, those generated in stills, decanters,
and wash oil units from the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal.
K144_Wastewater sump residues from light oil refining, including, but not limited to, intercepting or contamination
sump sludges from the recovery of coke by-products produced from coal.
K145_Residues from naphthalene collection and recovery operations from the recovery of coke by-products produced
from coal.
K147_Tar storage tank residues from coal tar refining.
K148_Residues from coal tar distillation, including but not limited to still bottoms.

<TEXT>
 

For coke by-product nonwastewaters, EPA is promulgating concentration-based standards based on incineration.
Under the authority of section 3007 of RCRA, EPA collected generation and management information concerning coke
by-product wastes; this information was collected in 1985 and 1987. The majority of K141 to K145 nonwastewaters generated
during that timeframe were recycled or used for energy recovery. Tar storage tank and tar distillation bottoms may
be removed periodically. The Agency identified the following annualized land-disposed quantities of wastes: 49
tons of K141 nonwastewaters, 2,750 tons of K142 nonwastewaters, 10 tons of K143 nonwastewaters, 304 tons of K144 nonwastewaters,
1,408 tons of K147 nonwastewaters, and less than 100 tons of K148 nonwastewaters. EPA identified no K145 nonwastewaters
that were being land disposed. The Agency solicited comments on the above estimated quantities that may require alternative
treatment as a result of the LDRs. However, no comments were received on this issue. Thus, EPA is using the estimates
shown above for the quantities of these wastes that may require treatment capacity as a result of the LDRs. 
Current management practices indicate that the majority of the newly listed coke by-product wastes are amenable
to recycling, and therefore alternative treatment may not be required as a result of today's final rule. Thus, EPA
believes that adequate capacity exists to treat the small amount of wastes that require alternative treatment. 
EPA does not have any information that coke by-product wastewaters are currently generated. The quantity of these
wastewaters is assumed to be zero. EPA solicited comments on changes of management practices or generation data on
these wastes. No comments were received on this issue. Consequently, EPA concludes that the quantity of these wastewaters
is zero. 
As a result of this analysis, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance to K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147,
and K148 nonwastewaters and wastewaters; however, the Agency is granting a three-month variance as described in
Section A for the reason described therein. 


b. Surface Disposed Chlorinated Toluene Wastes 


K149_Distillation bottoms from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene,
benzoyl chlorides, and compound with mixtures of these functional groups. (This waste does not include still bottoms
from the distillation of benzyl chloride.) 
K150_Organic residuals, excluding spent carbon adsorbent, from the spent chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid recovery
processes associated with the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene, benzoyl
chlorides and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups. 
K151_Wastewater treatment sludges, excluding neutralization and biological sludges, generated during the treatment
of wastewaters from the production of alpha (methyl) chlorinated toluene, ring-chlorinated toluene, benzoyl chlorides
and compounds with mixtures of these functional groups.

 

For wastes generated during the production of chlorinated toluene, EPA is promulgating concentration-based treatment
standards based on incineration for nonwastewaters. EPA collected generation and management information on wastes
generated from the production of chlorinated toluene. EPA collected this information under the authority of section
3007 of RCRA during engineering site visits in 1988. This capacity analysis incorporates data from the section 3007
information request and engineering site visits. EPA identified four facilities that produce chlorinated toluene
wastes. 
The Agency has identified no K149 nonwastewaters, no K150 nonwastewaters, and less than 100 tons of K151 nonwastewaters
that were being land disposed. For the capacity analysis, EPA assumes that these quantities are currently being land
disposed and will require treatment capacity as a result of today's final rule. 
EPA solicited comments on management practices and generation data on these wastes. One commenter requested a variance
because high concentrations of salt and halogenated compounds make these wastes difficult to incinerate. EPA contacted
a commercial incineration facility that stated that with proper management they could treat these wastes. Therefore,
EPA believes that a capacity variance is not warranted for these wastes. 
EPA does not have any information that chlorinated toluene wastewaters are currently generated. EPA solicited comments
on changes of management practices or generation data on these wastes. No comments were received on this issue. Thus,
EPA concludes that the quantity of these wastewaters is zero. 
Because adequate capacity exists to treat these wastes, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance for K149,
K150, and K151 nonwastewaters and wastewaters; however, like the other newly listed and identified wastes, EPA is
granting a three-month variance as described in Section A for the reason described therein. 


4. Newly Identified TC Wastes That Were Not Previously Hazardous by the Old EP Leaching Procedure 


In the Third Third LDR rule (55 FR 22520, June 1, 1990), EPA promulgated treatment standards for D012 through D017 wastes,
but only for those wastes that were previously hazardous by the old EP leaching procedure and remain hazardous under
the new TCLP. D012 through D017 wastes that were not hazardous by the old EP leaching procedure but are now hazardous
using the new TCLP are considered newly-identified D012 through D017 wastes. 
In response to the ANPRM (56 FR 55160, October 24, 1991), EPA did not receive any estimates for additional waste quantities
(or newly-identified wastes) due to the use of the TCLP rather than the EP leaching procedure. Similarly, no estimates
were received in response to the proposed rule. EPA believes that the quantities of the newly-identified D012 through
D017 wastes due to the use of the TCLP rather than the EP leaching procedure are small, if any, and, hence, expects little
or no additional demand for commercial treatment capacity as a result of the LDRs. Because sufficient capacity exists
to treat these wastes, EPA is not granting the newly-identified D012 through D017 wastes a national capacity variance.
However, the Agency is granting a three-month variance as described in Section A of the preamble.

D. Required and Available Capacity for Newly Listed and Identified Wastes Mixed with Radioactive Components 


EPA has defined a mixed RCRA/radioactive waste as any matrix containing a RCRA hazardous waste and a radioactive waste
subject to the Atomic Energy Act (53 FR 37045-37046, September 23, 1988). These mixed wastes are subject to RCRA
hazardous waste regulations, including the LDRs, regardless of the type of radioactive constituents contained
in these wastes. 
Radioactive wastes that are mixed with spent solvents, dioxins, California list wastes, First Third, Second Third,
or Third Third wastes, and Phase I wastes, are subject to the LDRs already promulgated for these hazardous wastes.
EPA granted national capacity variances for all of these mixed wastes because of a lack of national treatment capacity.
Today's rule addresses the radioactive wastes that contain newly listed and identified hazardous wastes being restricted
in today's rulemaking. 
Based on comments received by EPA in response to the proposed rule, the ANPRM (56 FR 55160, October 24, 1991), and previous
rulemakings, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is the primary generator of mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. A variety
of non-DOE facilities also generate mixed wastes, including nuclear power plants, academic and medical institutions,
and industrial facilities. 


1. Waste Generation 


a. Non-soil and Non-debris Mixed Radioactive Wastes 


In April 1993, DOE released the Interim Mixed Waste Inventory Report (IMWIR), which included a national inventory
of all mixed wastes that were being stored or would be generated over the next five years and a national inventory of
mixed waste treatment capacities and technologies. The report provides waste stream-specific and treatment facility-specific
information for each site managing DOE wastes. This report is currently being updated; however the Final Mixed Waste
Inventory Report (MWIR) Data Base that will be used to develop the Final MWIR was made public in May, 1994. This Data
Base was used to determine the quantity of DOE-generated mixed waste requiring treatment. 
Based on the MWIR data, EPA estimates that DOE generates 1,700 m

3

/yr of non-soil, non-debris mixed radioactive waste contaminated with TC organic constituents. In addition, DOE
currently has 19,000 m

3

 of these wastes in storage. Table 4 lists the quantities of each category of non-soil, non-debris mixed waste that
DOE expects to generate annually, as well as the amount currently in storage.

b. Mixed Radioactive Soil 


EPA derived data on the quantities of DOE mixed radioactive soils using MWIR data. Table 5 lists the quantities of each
category of mixed radioactive soil that is expected to be generated annually, as well as the amount currently in storage.
The quantity of hazardous soil in storage, or projected to be generated annually, is very small. This can be attributed
to the fact that the MWIR Data Base generally does not include DOE environmental restoration wastes. When these wastes
are generated they will increase the quantity of newly identified mixed wastes, particularly soil, that require
treatment. Although these wastes are not included in the Final MWIR Data Base, the IMWIR estimates that DOE will generate
a total of approximately 600,000 m

3

 of mixed environmental restoration wastes over the period from 1993 to 1997. Some of these wastes will likely be newly
identified organic TC mixed wastes. 






c. Mixed Radioactive Debris 


 EPA derived data on quantities of DOE mixed radioactive debris using MWIR data. Table 6 lists the quantities of each
category of mixed radioactive debris that is expected to be generated annually, as well as the quantity currently
in storage.

2. Available Capacity and Capacity Implications 




a. Non-soil and Non-debris Mixed Radioactive Wastes 


EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that 4,000 m

3

 of treatment capacity are available annually for HLW at three DOE treatment systems. The available capacity appears
sufficient to treat the estimated average annual generation. However, the IMWIR indicates that the current national
inventory of HLW is greater than 280,000 m

3

. This quantity dwarfs DOE's annual available treatment capacity for HLW. Consequently, DOE faces a treatment capacity
shortfall for high-level radioactive wastes. 
DOE is developing the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico as a permanent repository for DOE TRU wastes,
including MTRU wastes. However, DOE is not yet authorized to begin the placement of TRU wastes in the WIPP. In addition,
wastes received at the WIPP must meet DOE's WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria (WIPP-WAC). DOE is still in the planning
stages for facilities designed to prepare MTRU wastes for shipment to the WIPP. As a result, DOE faces a capacity shortfall
for treatment of MTRU wastes. 
EPA's review of the IMWIR data indicates that 340 m

3

/yr of currently available capacity exists at four DOE treatment systems for the treatment of alpha MLLW (i.e., MLLW
with an alpha particle content between 10 and 100 nCi/g). However, the available capacity is greatly exceeded by the
estimated quantity of alpha MLLW requiring treatment annually over the next five years, 3,700 m

3

. Consequently, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for non-soil, non-debris alpha MLLW. 
According to IMWIR, 1,000,000 m

3

/yr of treatment capacity among 26 systems are currently available to treat non-alpha MLLW. However, IMWIR states
that most of DOE's currently available treatment capacity for MLLW is represented by facilities limited to the treatment
of wastewaters (defined by DOE as less than 1 percent total suspended solids (TSS)). While these treatment facilities
provide excess capacity for MLLW wastewaters, they cannot process wastes with high TSS and are not readily adaptable
for other waste forms. Thus, although the quantity of MLLW treatment capacity is greater than the total quantity of
mixed wastes, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for nonwastewater MLLW, and thus non-alpha MLLW. 
 While DOE has provided its best available data on mixed waste generation, uncertainty remains about mixed waste generation
at DOE (and non-DOE) facilities. For example, not all DOE Field Organizations responded to DOE's request for information
following publication of the ANPRM. In addition, the data submitted to EPA generally did not include DOE environmental
restoration wastes which, when generated, will increase the quantity of newly identified mixed wastes that require
treatment. The IMWIR estimates that DOE will generate a total of 600,000 m

3

 of mixed environmental restoration wastes over the period from 1993 to 1997. Although the IMWIR notes that the estimates
of DOE environmental restoration wastes are preliminary, the quantities noted above will place additional strains
on DOE's limited available mixed waste treatment capacity. 
Although DOE is in the process of increasing its capacity to manage mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes, information supplied
by DOE indicates that a significant capacity shortfall currently exists for the treatment of mixed RCRA/radioactive
wastes, much of which are in storage facilities awaiting treatment. DOE has indicated that it will generally give
treatment priority to mixed wastes that are already restricted under previous LDR rules (e.g., radioactive wastes
mixed with solvents, dioxins, California list wastes, First Third, Second Third, or Third Third wastes, and Phase
I wastes). DOE is also concerned about the availability of treatment capacity for mixed wastes that will be generated
as a result of site remediation activities. EPA's review of non-DOE data sources also showed a significant lack of
commercial treatment capacity. 
In response to the Phase II proposed rule, EPA received six comments concerning the proposal to grant a two-year national
capacity variance for non-soil, non-debris TC organic mixed radioactive wastes. All six commenters, including
DOE, were in favor of the two-year national capacity variance. Furthermore, none of the commenters identified any
additional treatment capacity for the wastes. Thus, despite the uncertainty about the exact quantities of mixed
radioactive wastes containing newly listed and identified wastes that will require treatment as a result of today's
rule, the quantities appear to exceed available capacity. In addition, any new commercial capacity that does become
available will be needed for mixed radioactive wastes that were regulated in previous LDR rulemakings and whose variances
have already expired. Therefore, EPA has determined that sufficient alternative treatment capacity is not available
for mixed radioactive wastes contaminated with newly listed and identified wastes whose standards are being promulgated
today, and thus is granting a two-year national capacity variance for these wastes. 


b. Mixed Radioactive Soil 


EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that no available treatment capacity exists at DOE facilities for mixed radioactive
soils. As indicated earlier, a preliminary estimate of mixed radioactive soil is approximately 10 m

3

/yr. Therefore, EPA is granting a two-year national capacity variance for mixed radioactive soils. 


c. Mixed Radioactive Debris

<TEXT>
 

EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that less than 2 m3/yr of treatment capacity is available that can accept mixed
low-level debris, an amount that exceeds the estimated annual generation. In addition, DOE has not yet been authorized
to begin placement of MTRU wastes into the WIPP. As a result, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for mixed transuranic
debris. Therefore, EPA is granting a two-year national capacity variance to debris contaminated with mixed radioactive
wastes.



E. Required and Available Capacity for High TOC Ignitable, TC Pesticide, and Newly Listed Wastes Injected Into Class
I Deep Wells



As explained in previous rules concerning land disposal restrictions (see e.g., 52 FR 32450, August 27, 1987; 53 FR
30912, August 16, 1988; 55 FR 22520, June 1, 1990), EPA is allocating available capacity first to those wastes disposed
in surface units, second to wastes resulting from CERCLA and RCRA clean ups, and finally to underground injected wastes.
Based on this hierarchical approach, the Agency is promulgating the following effective dates for injected wastes.

EPA still has very limited information which differentiates high TOC D001 ignitable wastes from low TOC D001 ignitable
wastes, particularly with reference to the type of Class I injection well (i.e., nonhazardous versus hazardous)
into which the wastes are disposed. The information the Agency does have indicates that both D001 ignitable wastes
and D012-D017 TC pesticide wastes are deep well injected into Class I hazardous wells with no-migration variances.
EPA is concerned that since these wastes are being generated, the potential exists that diluted D001 ignitable wastes
and D012-D017 TC pesticide wastes are also being injected into Class I nonhazardous wells. In the proposed rule,
EPA estimated that, based on management practices, low volumes of diluted high TOC ignitable waste were injected
into Class I nonhazardous wells, and less than 420 tons of D012-D017 pesticide wastes are deep well injected
into Class I nonhazardous wells. However, several commenters to the proposed rule, and other industries with Class
I injection wells, have indicated that it would be extremely difficult to identify, segregate, treat, and/or arrange
for disposal of these waste streams in a short time frame. This may be particularly true if waste volumes for high TOC
D001 ignitable wastes are discovered to greatly exceed earlier estimates. The facilities, depending on their Class
I injection wells, would have to reconfigure their disposal systems, which may include the construction or rearrangement
of wastelines or piping.

To allow sufficient time to address these logistical problems, EPA is granting a one-year national capacity variance
to allow the Class I injection facilities an appropriate lead time to identify their decharacterized high TOC D001
and D012-D017 waste streams and to create an infrastructure that allows their alternative management consistent
with today's rule and the statute. This may include installation of equipment to segregate wastes. For operators
applying for no-migration petitions, the variance will allow time for conducting the modelling or other analysis,
for EPA review, and for the operators to make alternative arrangements if the petitions are not granted.

The following wastes are the newly listed wastes for which numerical standards are being promulgated, and which current
data indicate are not being underground injected:




Coke By-Product Wastes: K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147, K148

Chlorotoluene Production Wastes: K149, K150, K151




The Agency requested further comment on whether any of these wastes are being injected. Comment was also requested
on what quantities of wastes are being injected, and on the characteristics of these wastes. However, no comments
were received on this issue. EPA is therefore not granting a national capacity variance for coke production wastes
(K141-K145, K147, K148) and for chlorotoluene production wastes (K149-K151) injected into Class I deep
wells.



F. Required and Available Capacity for Hazardous Soil and Debris Contaminated with Newly Listed and Identified Wastes



This capacity analysis focuses on hazardous soil and debris contaminated with wastes whose treatment standards
are promulgated in today's rule.

EPA used several data sources to estimate the total quantity of land-disposed hazardous soil and debris. These sources
include: responses to the Advance Notice to the Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) for the newly identified wastes (56 FR
55160); the TC Survey; information provided during a series of roundtable meetings held by the Agency in May and June
of 1991 with representatives of companies involved in the management and disposal of hazardous debris and soil; the
Biennial Reporting System (BRS); Records of Decision (RODs) of Superfund sites; the TSDR Survey; and the National
Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators.






1. Waste Generation



a. Hazardous Soil 


The hazardous soil covered by this rule includes soil contaminated with D018-D043 organic TC wastes, and soils
contaminated with coke by-product wastes and chlorinated toluene wastes. The largest quantity of hazardous soil
affected by today's rulemaking is hazardous soil contaminated with D018-D043 organic TC wastes. At the time
of the proposal, the Agency estimated that approximately 233,000 tons per year of TC soils would require off-site
treatment and the majority of these TC soils was expected to be generated from surface impoundment closures. Based
on new data received from owners/operators concerning surface impoundment closure practices, the Agency now estimates
that the annual quantities of TC soil that is land disposed and subject to the LDRs ranges from 70,000 to 120,000 tons.
Because TC soil generation from surface impoundment closures is somewhat discretionary, decisions by owners/operators
of facilities concerning closure methods significantly changed the generation rates previously estimated in the
TC Survey.

The Agency contacted facilities expected to generate TC soils from surface impoundment closures in 1993, 1994, and
1995 to confirm generation rates. Nearly all of the owners/operators revised their estimates for TC soil generation
downward. Most owners/operators revised their closure practices to minimize or eliminate TC soil generation. Some
facilities closed impoundments prior to today's rulemaking and other facilities are closing their impoundments
as landfills. In closing as a landfill, a facility closes the impoundment with the waste in place. The facility owners/operators
remove all free liquids, stabilize the sludges, cap the impoundment, and establish a ground water monitoring system.
Therefore, for these facilities, no LDR treatment capacity would be necessary for TC soils. Of the facilities that
predicted TC soil generation in 1994 and 1995, no facility currently expects to ship TC soils generated from a surface
impoundment closure off-site for LDR treatment.

<TEXT>
 

However, for at least two facilities, some uncertainty existed concerning the ability of these facilities to ship
all of their TC soils off-site prior to today's rulemaking. Nevertheless, even if these facilities generated all
their TC soils after today's rulemaking, the impact on LDR treatment capacity would be minimal because these facilities
were expected to generate only 5,300 tons of TC soils. Therefore, only 5,300 tons of TC soils generated by surface impoundment
closures might require off-site treatment.

The Agency also reviewed the TC data base and public information on specific facilities to assess the TC soil generation
rate from routine and sporadic activities that might require off-site disposal. For this analysis, the Agency assumed
that routine activities and the quantity of soil generated should be considered constant over time when analyzing
the generator population as a whole. However, for sporadic activities (e.g. surface impoundment closures), which
by their nature occur infrequently, the year in which they occur is critically important in determining the required
capacity for soil when the rule becomes effective.

In the TC Survey, some TC wastes were only characterized as a mixture of soil and debris. For the lower bound estimate
(70,000 tons), the Agency assumed a 50-50 ratio of soil and debris in mixtures characterized as soil and debris.
Using this assumption, EPA estimates that approximately 70,000 tons of TC soils generated by routine and sporadic
activities will require additional treatment annually. In addition, in this lower bound estimate, the Agency assumed
that all facilities were able to manage the TC soils generated from surface impoundment closures prior to the effective
date of today's rule. Therefore, for the lower bound estimate, no TC soils from surface impoundment closures are expected
to require additional treatment capacity. Based on these assumptions, the Agency calculates that the lower bound
estimate is 70,000 tons of TC soils per year.

For the upper bound estimate, the Agency assigned the entire quantity of mixtures of soil and debris reported in the
TC survey as TC soils. As a result, the TC soil generation rate for routine and sporadic activities increased by about
20,000 tons. The Agency conducted a similar review of facilities that submitted confidential business information
(CBI) concerning TC soil generation rates. When assuming a 100 percent of mixtures were TC soils, these facilities
were estimated to generate an additional 53,000 tons of TC soils for a total of 143,000 tons.

To verify the accuracy of the upper bound estimate, the Agency contacted individual facilities to determine actual
TC soil generation rates. Based on these contacts, the TC data base overestimated TC soil generation from routine
and sporadic activities. Many facilities stated that actual generation rates were lower or that the estimate included
one time wastes from surface impoundment closures that already occurred. Therefore, when the Agency revised the
upper bound estimates, TC soil generation rates for routine and sporadic activities at all facilities (non-CBI and
CBI facilities) were approximately 114,000 tons. After adding the 5,300 tons of TC soils generated by surface impoundment
closures, the estimated upper bound quantity of TC soil requiring additional treatment is approximately 120,000
tons per year.

Due to reduced generation of TC soils from surface impoundment closures in 1994 and 1995 and overestimations of TC
soil generation rates from routine and sporadic activities, the Agency estimates that between 70,000 and 120,000
tons per year of TC soils will require off-site treatment.

At the time of the proposed rulemaking, the Agency was uncertain concerning the quantities of TC soil generated from
manufactured gas plants (MGP). Most of the soil generated at these plants is expected to be contaminated with benzene.
EPA requested updated information on the generation and management of these wastes and on whether there will be sufficient
commercial treatment services to treat these wastes on-site. No comments were received that specified quantities
of soil generated or discussed commercial capacity for contaminated soils. While EPA acknowledges that generation
of TC-contaminated soil from MGP will occur, the Agency expects that most of this quantity will be managed on-site
and will not require off-site or commercial treatment capacity. Therefore, EPA has concluded that TC-contaminated
soil from MGPs will not significantly affect the required treatment capacity for soil.

Similarly, several commenters to the ANPRM indicated that EPA may have underestimated the annual quantities of hazardous
soil generated. Some commenters provided site specific data on the quantities of soil generated during remedial
actions. The Agency incorporated these data in its analysis of the required capacity for hazardous soil.

In the proposed rule, EPA requested comments on the use of innovative technologies for hazardous soil. Specifically,
EPA requested information on constraints to the use of these technologies both on- and off-site, including physical
or chemical characteristics of the wastes, and logistical constraints such as permitting and scheduling. One commenter
noted that to treat soil on-site requires permitting and approval by local, state, and federal agencies, which may
be a problem for some innovative technologies. Another said that the chemical concentration to which a soil can be
biotreated is influenced by the particular chemical, the soil type, the age of the contaminated media, and the bioremediation
process. EPA has taken these comments into account in estimating the available capacity provided by innovative technologies
for the treatment of hazardous soil.

b. Hazardous Debris 



This rule covers debris contaminated with the newly listed 
and identified wastes covered in this rule. As shown in Table 7, 
data from the TC Survey indicates that approximately 34,000 tons 
of debris contaminated with D018-D043 wastes may be currently 
land disposed.

2. Current Management Practices 
 


Waste generators and TSDFs report that most of the soils 
contaminated with D018-D043 newly identified organic TC wastes 
are currently landfilled without prior treatment. Incineration 
is the commercial off-site treatment technology reportedly 
available for these wastes. 

Other than incineration for treating organic TC-contaminated 
soil, EPA has no information on the commercial off-site 
availability of other treatment technologies (e.g., low 
temperature thermal desorption, bioremediation, solvent 
extraction). Although several commenters to the ANPRM mentioned 
bioremediation as an alternative to incineration for the 
treatment of TC-contaminated soils, no commenter provided 
facility specific information on commercially available off-site 
treatment capacity for this technology. The lack of off-site 
commercial capacity for technologies other than incineration was 
confirmed by responses to EPA's request for voluntary information 
from vendors of innovative technologies provided in the Vendor 
Information System for Innovative Treatment Technologies 
(VISITT). At the time of the proposed rule, EPA had received no 
information that special-handling problems may limit the quantity 
of hazardous soil that currently can be treated by incineration, 
and EPA requested information on special-handling concerns with 
managing these wastes. No comments were received on this issue. 
Thus, EPA has concluded that the quantity of hazardous soil that 
can be treated by incineration will not be limited by special-handling problems. 



3. Available Capacity and Capacity Implications 
 

a. Hazardous Soil 
 

EPA is requiring that hazardous soil be treated prior to 
land disposal. EPA has determined that available destruction 
(e.g., incineration) and immobilization (e.g., stabilization) 
capacity exists. Some additional capacity also exists from many 
of the technologies in the extraction family (e.g., soil washing, 
chemical extraction). However, some of the capacity of 
extraction technologies currently used to decontaminate soils, 
such as soil washing, may not have received requisite permits by 
the effective date of this rule, although EPA is exploring the 
various opportunities for these technologies to become 
operational in an expedited manner. (Please contact the 
appropriate EPA regional office or the state hazardous waste 
program.) Thus, EPA anticipates that the off-site commercial 
capacity available to treat hazardous soils at the time this rule 
becomes effective will be limited to incineration and 
stabilization. 

EPA recognizes that innovative technologies are also 
available to treat hazardous soil. Performance of these 
technologies also may be the basis for treatability variances 
pursuant to  268.44(h). EPA requested comments on the 
practicality and current availability of these technologies. EPA 
received comments that the proposed soil standards cannot be met 
by bioremediation, but may be met by innovative technologies such 
as thermal desorption and soil vapor extraction. However, EPA 
did not receive any comments on the current availability of these 
technologies. Thus, EPA has concluded that the off-site 
treatment capacity for hazardous soils will initially be limited 
to incineration and stabilization. 

The Agency also solicited comments on the need for a 
capacity variance and on estimates of available treatment 
capacity. One commenter opposed the proposed capacity variance 
for soils and said that EPA should_at the very least_require 
treatment of ``hot spots.'' Several commenters supported the two-year national capacity variance. However, EPA
has determined 
that a national capacity variance is unnecessary for hazardous 
soils. 



b. Hazardous Debris 


EPA estimates that approximately 34,000 tons of debris 
contaminated with newly identified organic TC wastes are 
currently land disposed and require off-site commercial treatment 
capacity. The capacity analysis conducted for debris 
contaminated with Phase II wastes indicates that sufficient 
capacity exists to treat debris contaminated with organics. 
Therefore, EPA is not granting a national capacity variance for 
hazardous debris contaminated with organic TC wastes and other 
listed organic wastes covered in this rule. 



XV. State Authority 


A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States 


Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified 
States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the 
State. Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement 
authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although 
authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. The 
standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR 
part 271. 

Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 
(HSWA), a State with final authorization administered its 
hazardous waste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal 
program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer 
applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits 
for any facilities that the State was authorized to permit. When 
new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or 
enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority 
within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not 
take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the 
requirements as State law. 

In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), 
new requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in 
authorized States at the same time that they take effect in 
nonauthorized States. EPA is directed to carry out these 
requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the 
issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to 
do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as 
State law to retain final authorization, HSWA is implemented 
Federally in authorized States in the interim.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940919-0-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Certain portions of today's rule are being promulgated 
pursuant to sections 3004 (d) through (k), and (m), of RCRA (42 
U.S.C. 6924 (d) through (k), and (m)). These will be added to 
Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal program 
requirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and that take 
effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status. 
States may apply for either interim or final authorization for 
the HSWA provisions in Table 1, as discussed in the following 
section of this preamble. Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) is also 
modified to indicate that this rule is a self-implementing 
provision of HSWA. 




B. Effect on State Authorization 




As noted above, today's rule, with the exception of the 
changes in the definition of solid waste (see preamble section 
IX, and further discussion in this section, below), will be 
implemented in authorized States until their programs are 
modified to adopt these rules and the modification is approved by 
EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to HSWA, a State 
submitting a program modification may apply to receive either 
interim or final authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 
3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are 
substantially equivalent or equivalent to EPA's. The procedures 
and schedule for State program modifications for either interim 
or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. On 
December 18, 1992, EPA extended the period allowing interim 
authorization to January 1, 2003 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c) and 57 FR 
60129). 


Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final 
authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal 
program changes and must subsequently submit the modification to 
EPA for approval. The deadline by which the State would have to 
modify its program to adopt these regulations is specified in 
section 271.21(e). Once EPA approves the modification, the State 
requirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements. 


States with authorized RCRA programs may already have 
requirements similar to those in today's rule. These State 
regulations have not been assessed against the Federal 
regulations being promulgated today to determine whether they 
meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not 
authorized to implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until 
the State program modifications are approved. Of course, states 
with existing standards could continue to administer and enforce 
their standards as a matter of State law. In the period between 
the effective date of today's rule and the approval of state 
program modifications, the regulated communities in authorized 
states generally must comply with state regulations in addition 
to the provisions in today's rule. The regulated community 
should continue to consult with state agencies authorized to 
administer LDRs. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will 
work with States under agreements to minimize duplication of 
efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States 
in their efforts to implement their programs rather than take 
separate actions under Federal authority. 


States that submit official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date of
these 
regulations are not required to include standards equivalent to 
these regulations in their application. However, the State must 
modify its program by the deadline set forth in  271.21(e). 
States that submit official applications for final authorization 
12 months after the effective date of these regulations must 
include standards equivalent to these regulations in their 
application. The requirements a state must meet when submitting 
its final authorization application are set forth in 40 CFR 
271.3. 


The regulations promulgated today need not affect the 
State's Underground Injection Control (UIC) primacy status. A 
State currently authorized to administer the UIC program under 
the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) could continue to do so 
without seeking authority to administer the amendments that will 
be promulgated at a future date. However, a State which wished 
to implement Part 148 and receive authorization to grant 
exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to 
demonstrate that it had the requisite authority to administer 
sections 3004 (f) and (g) of RCRA. The conditions under which 
such an authorization may take place are summarized below and are 
discussed in a July 15, 1985 final rule (50 FR 28728). 


The modifications to the definition of solid waste in this 
rule (see preamble section IX) are based on non-HSWA authority. 
This portion of the rule, because it is not based on HSWA 
authority, will be applicable immediately only in those States 
that do not have final RCRA authorization. In authorized States, 
these requirements will not apply until the States revise their 
programs to adopt equivalent requirements under State law. In 
addition, this modification broadens the ``closed-loop'' recycling 
exclusion from the definition of solid waste. The modification 
to this rule is less stringent, or reduces the scope of, the 
Federal program. Therefore, although EPA strongly encourages 
timely adoption, authorized States are not required to modify 
their programs to adopt regulations consistent with and 
equivalent to this provision. 




XVI. Regulatory Requirements 




A. Regulatory Impact Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 




 Executive Order No. 12866 requires agencies to determine 
whether a regulatory action is ``significant.'' The Order defines 
a ``significant'' regulatory action as one that ``is likely to 
result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect, in a 
material way, the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or 
State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create 
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary 
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or 
the rights and obligations of recipients; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the 
President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the 
Executive Order.'' 


The Agency estimated the costs of today's final rule to 
determine if it is a significant regulation as defined by the 
Executive Order. The incremental compliance costs for today's 
rule were estimated as a range from $194 to $219 million per 
year. Therefore, today's final rule is considered an 
economically significant rule, having an annual effect on the 
economy of over $100 million. The Agency prepared a regulatory 
impact analysis which analyzed the costs, economic impacts, and 
benefits of today's final rule. 


This section of the preamble for today's final rule provides 
a discussion of the methodology used for estimating the costs, 
economic impacts and the benefits attributable to today's final 
rule, followed by a presentation of the cost, economic impact and 
benefit results. Limitations to these estimates are described in 
the results section. More detailed discussions of the 
methodology and results may be found in the background document, 
``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Land Disposal Restrictions 
Final Rule for the Phase 2 Newly Listed and Identified Wastes,'' 
which has been placed in the docket for today's final rule.

1. Methodology Section 




In today's final rule, the Agency is establishing treatment 
standards for newly identified and listed wastes, as well as any 
soils and debris which are contaminated with such wastes. (The 
Agency plans to develop alternative standards for hazardous soils 
as a part of the Hazardous Wastes Identification Rule (HWIR).) 
The newly identified wastes covered under today's rule include 
wastes displaying the organic toxicity characteristic (TC), and 
pesticide wastes that were not previously hazardous by the EP 
leaching procedure. The newly listed wastes are Coke By-product 
wastes and Chlorotoluene wastes. 


Of the newly regulated hazardous soil in today's rule, the 
only existing volumes are soils contaminated with TC wastes. 
(Any volumes of soil contaminated with F037 and F038 listed 
wastes which exist are not covered in today's rule, but are being 
covered in a future Agency rulemaking.) Finally, the Agency is 
promulgating new testing and recordkeeping requirements, as well 
as reducing other recordkeeping requirements. 


Furthermore, today's final rule proposes Universal Treatment 
Standards (UTS) for wastes already regulated under the LDRs. The 
Agency's analysis includes an analysis of the volumes affected by 
this change in treatment levels. (In the switch to UTS levels 
there are cases where the new UTS level is less stringent than 
the existing listing levels, as well as cases where the UTS is 
more stringent than existing levels. Either of these cases would 
have the potential to change the costs associated with treatment 
of these wastes.) 




a. Methodology for Estimating the Affected Universe 




In determining the costs, economic impacts, and benefits 
associated with today's rule, the Agency estimated the volumes of 
TC nonwastewaters, Coke By-Product wastes, and Chlorotoluene 
wastes affected by today's rule. For the TC wastes, the Agency 
employed the 1995 volume estimates presented for each affected 
waste in the Agency's 1992 TC Census Database (hereafter referred 
to as the ``TC Survey''). (There are several ways in which the 
volumes employed for the capacity determinations differ from 
those used in the RIA.) The capacity determinations section of 
the preamble describes the methods used there to determine 
volumes. The scope of the RIA differs from that of the capacity 
determination in the ``time window'' analyzed. The RIA examines 
the short- and long-term impacts from the rule. Capacity 
determinations, on the other hand, are made for a two year time 
frame beginning at the promulgation of today's rule. 


The Agency employed the volumes of Coke By-Products and 
Chlorotoluene wastes estimated in their respective listing 
analyses. For Coke By-Products, current management practices 
suggest that no volumes will be land disposed. 




b. Cost Methodology 




 The cost analysis estimates the national level incremental 
costs which will be incurred as a result of today's rule. The 
cost estimates for both the baseline and post-regulatory 
scenarios are calculated employing: (i) The facility wastestream 
volume, (ii) the management practice (baseline or post-
regulatory) assigned to that wastestream, and (iii) the unit cost 
associated with that practice. Summing the costs for all 
facilities produces the total costs for the given waste and 
scenario. Subtracting the baseline cost from the post-regulatory 
cost produces the national incremental cost associated with 
today's rule for the given waste. The unit costs include costs 
for Subtitle D and Subtitle C disposal (as appropriate), and 
transportation costs where necessary; all dollar estimates are in 
1993 dollars (unless otherwise noted.) 


Each section below summarizes the baseline and post-
regulatory management practices assignments for each waste. The 
unit costs employed for the management practices are summarized 
in the RIA background document for today's rule. 


The cost methodology section includes three sub-sections: 
(i) TC organic wastes, (ii) Other newly identified wastes, 
(iii) Testing, record-keeping, and permit modification costs. 




i. Organic Toxicity Characteristic Wastes (D018-D043) 




The standards established in today's rule for the organic TC 
wastes require the treatment of all underlying hazardous 
constituents. The affected TC wastes can be divided into three 
groups: TC nonwastewaters, TC soils, and TC debris. While TC 
wastewaters which are not managed in CWA or CWA-equivalent units 
are being regulated in today's rule, the current management 
practices for these volumes do not trigger land disposal (RCRA 
exempt tanks, etc.), and therefore are not subject to the LDRs. 
Below, EPA describes the method of estimating the costs incurred 
in complying with the TC standards in today's rule. 


In establishing a baseline for the TC nonwastewaters, TC 
hazardous soils, and TC hazardous debris affected by today's 
rule, the Agency assumed Subtitle C landfilling as the current 
management practice. The Agency believes that there are TC 
wastes which are not affected by today's rule because they are 
already being treated to comply with the standards established in 
today's rule (e.g.: wastes with high BTU value which are being 
used as fuel, etc.). The Agency assumed that landfilling was 
occurring on-site for noncommercial (company captive) facilities, 
and off-site for commercial facilities. Employing today's 
requirement of treating for all underlying constituents 
reasonably expected to be present, the Agency developed 
technology assignments for the wastes at each facility. The 
assignments include a treatment technology (or treatment train 
where required), and subsequent Subtitle D disposal. These 
assignments were based on waste characterization and constituent 
concentration data. Where little or no such data were available 
for a wastestream, the weighted average unit cost was assigned 
(the weighted average unit cost was calculated separately for 
nonwastewaters, soils, and debris). 


The Agency allows a generator of hazardous soil to apply for 
a treatability variance. The Agency, however, has not analyzed 
the potential short-term savings which could be realized in the 
management of hazardous soil, and therefore may have 
overestimated the cost impacts of the rule in the short-term. 
There is also some uncertainty where certain technologies will be 
available to treat TC nonwastewaters. The Agency performed a 
sensitivity analysis to characterize this uncertainty, which is 
included in the RIA Background Document.

ii. Other Newly Identified Wastes 


In addition to organic TC wastes, the wastes affected by 
today's final rule include coke by-product and chlorotoluene 
wastes. Based on an economic analysis conducted by the Agency 
for the listing of coke by-product waste, generators recycle 
these wastes rather than disposing of them in Subtitle C 
landfills. Therefore, EPA estimates that negligible volumes of 
coke by-product wastes would be affected by this rule. For the 
chlorotoluene waste volumes, EPA conducted a detailed cost 
analysis using site specific data. 


iii. Testing, Recordkeeping, and Permit Modification Costs 


In addition to the costs for treatment of wastes, EPA 
estimated the incremental costs of the testing and recordkeeping 
requirements in today's rule. Testing and recordkeeping costs 
were developed for all wastes addressed in today's rule. 
The Agency examined the incremental cost of the testing 
requirements under today's rule. The Agency considered the 
baseline scenario to include testing for waste identification. 
The post-regulatory scenario would include testing for waste 
identification, testing to determine the number and concentration 
of constituents requiring treatment, and testing following 
treatment to ensure compliance with the standards. 
For the analysis of recordkeeping costs, the Agency employed 
the estimates developed in the Information Collection Request 
(ICR) for today's rule. These estimates were employed in a 
facility specific analysis to develop a total incremental cost 
associated with the testing and recordkeeping requirements in 
today's rule. 
The Agency also performed a sensitivity analysis on 
potential permit modification costs for facilities which may 
switch to on-site treatment. EPA applied a schedule of payments 
based on the costs of permit modifications to a group of nine 
facilities. The results of this analysis are provided in the 
Background Document RIA. 


c. Waste Minimization Methodology 


Since reducing waste generation may be less costly than 
treating these wastes to LDR standards, the Agency performed an 
analysis examining the potential waste minimization alternatives 
available to facilities. The analysis followed a multi-step 
methodology which included: (1) Develop a profile of the 
industries which indicated plans for waste minimization in the 
1992 TC Survey Database, (2) select industries to examine which 
would be representative of the TC waste universe, (3) make 
telephone data verification calls to facilities within these 
industries, (4) determine the cost components for the post-regulatory and waste minimization scenarios for all
wastestreams 
for those facilities, (5) estimate whether potential total 
costs/cost savings for the waste minimization and the post-regulatory (i.e., without waste minimization) scenarios
would be a 
profitable investment for the firms, and (6) extrapolate results 
to the TC waste universe, and determine overall cost/cost savings. 


d. Economic Impact Methodology 


The economic effects of today's final rule are defined as 
the difference between the industrial activity under post-regulatory conditions and the industrial activity in
the absence 
of regulation (i.e., baseline conditions). It should be noted 
that the volumes used for the economic impacts analysis do not 
include the reduction in volumes, and thus in costs, from waste 
minimization practices. 
The Agency has evaluated the economic impacts for facilities 
managing organic TC wastes on a facility specific basis, limited 
only by the extent that data were available. EPA estimated the 
economic effects by comparing incremental annual compliance costs 
to a number of company financial measures, such as revenues, cost 
of operations, operating income, and net income. Financial data 
were obtained from Standard & Poor's Corporation Descriptions for 
the last fiscal year reported. 
Since EPA believes that no costs will be associated with the 
treatment standards for coke by-products in the final rule, no 
economic impacts will be associated with regulation of these 
wastes. Economic impacts of compliance for facilities currently 
land disposing chlorotoluenes were evaluated in aggregated form, 
as information relating to these wastes are proprietary. 


e. Benefits Methodology 


This section discusses the benefit estimates for today's 
rule. The section includes: i. Analysis of the universal 
treatment standards, ii. hazardous waste recycling exemption, 
iii. groundwater pathway benefits, and iv. air pathway benefits. 


i. Analysis of the Impact of the Universal Treatment Standards 


To determine the cost implications of the Universal 
Treatment Standards (UTS), the Agency compared the UTS levels for 
each constituent to those levels established for each constituent 
in each waste code in the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) 
program to date. 
The Agency assumed that there would only be a cost impact 
when the levels were sufficiently different to require a change 
in the treatment technology used in order to meet the new UTS 
levels. The comparison of levels rendered three results: (a) No 
cost impact because the constituent levels were the same, (b) no 
cost impact because the constituent levels were within one order 
of magnitude of each other, or (c) a potential cost impact 
because the constituent levels were greater than one order of 
magnitude apart. 
Upon identifying those waste code/constituent pairs which 
were significantly different (i.e., greater than one order of 
magnitude), the Agency developed an estimate of the costs/cost 
savings based on the incremental difference in the previous 
technology required and the new technology required to meet the 
specified levels. 


ii. Hazardous Waste Recycling Exemption 


The Agency also estimated the potential cost savings 
resulting from the hazardous waste recycling exemption for K069 
wastes. Obtaining volumes data from the Biennial Reporting 
System (BRS), and employing unit cost data, the Agency calculated 
the cost savings associated with the change allowed in management 
practices. The Agency limited the analysis to K069 wastestreams 
that are not mixed with other hazardous waste codes, since these 
mixtures may not be amenable or legal for recycling. 


iii. Human Health Risk Reduction_Groundwater Pathway 


The Agency evaluated two types of human health benefits for 
today's rule: reduction in human health risks via the groundwater pathway, and reduction in human health risks via
the air 
pathway. EPA's analysis of the benefits of today's rule covers 
TC wastes only. These wastes dominate the other wastestreams 
covered by today's rule in terms of volume. Moreover, these are 
the only wastes for which the Agency had the data necessary to 
conduct a benefits assessment, in terms of attributes such as 
constituent concentrations and facility-specific wastestream 
volumes. 
The fundamental assumption underlying EPA's approach for 
assessing groundwater risk reduction is that Subtitle C 
containment is completely effective in the short-term, i.e., over 
a period of about 30 years, but that in the longer term, 
containment systems will fail. The benefits analysis performed 
for today's rule examines this potential long-term risk which 
would be avoided under today's rule (i.e., only occurring at least 
30 years into the future). The difference in risks from the 
baseline to the post-regulatory condition is the measure of 
incremental benefit associated with today's rule.

<TEXT>
 

The basic approach involves the following steps (which are 
elaborated upon in the RIA background document, which has been 
placed in the docket for today's rule). (1) The Agency employed 
waste concentration data from the TC Survey to represent waste 
concentrations. (2) EPA calculated the mean concentration of each 
constituent at each facility, weighted across the volume of all 
TC wastes managed at that facility. (3) EPA calculated the risk 
that would be posed by consumption of leachate, for both cancer 
and non-cancer effects, at each facility. (4) EPA developed a set 
of dilution/attenuation factors (DAF) to represent the effect of 
fate and transport processes in a homogeneous ground-water 
system. For each facility, the Agency divided the risk posed by 
the consumption of leachate by the DAF (expressed as a 
probability distribution) to yield the risk posed by predicted 
concentrations in water from hypothetical exposure wells. (5) EPA 
then summed the predicted risks across all facilities to develop 
an estimate of the distribution of individual risk at facilities 
managing untreated TC wastes. In addition, the Agency simulated 
the post-regulatory scenario, and summed the predicted risks 
across facilities, and developed the incremental risk reduction 
attributable to today's rule. (6) EPA subsequently developed an 
estimate of the potential incremental population risk using 1990 
population estimates around each site. The Agency used standard 
assumptions for body weight (70 kg) and water intake (2 liters 
per day) for 9 years. 


v. Human Health Risk Reduction_Air Pathway 


Constituents contained in TC waste, soil, and debris may be 
emitted to air through volatilization and dust entrainment. 
Reducing the concentrations of TC constituents through the 
treatment standards set in today's rule reduces the potential for 
air emissions, and the risks posed by those air emissions. The 
goal of the air pathway risk analysis was to characterize 
baseline (pre-LDR) risk and the reduction in baseline risk 
resulting from regulatory requirements in today's rule. 
The Agency's basic approach for the air pathway risk 
analysis involves the following steps (which are elaborated upon 
in the RIA background document, which has been placed in the 
docket for today's rule). (1) EPA used bulk waste concentration 
data from the TC Survey to represent waste concentrations. (2) 
the Agency calculated the mean concentration of each constituent 
at each facility, weighted across the volume of all TC wastes 
managed at that facility. (3) EPA calculated the unit area 
managing TC wastes. (4) EPA estimated emissions due to 
volatilization and dust entrainment for each constituent at each 
facility. (5) The Agency evaluated the atmospheric transport for 
each constituent. EPA then estimated exposure concentrations at 
several downwind points corresponding to potential exposure 
locations. The Agency employed standard high-end assumptions of 
body weight (70 kg) and 70-year lifetime. (6) The Agency 
calculated individual cancer risk and non-cancer risk across the 
facilities, using the modeled exposure assumptions. (7) EPA 
calculated population risk for exposed populations. (8) The 
Agency then simulated the risk under the regulatory requirements 
in today's rule, and determined the incremental risk reduction. 


2. Results Section 


a. Volume Results 


The Agency has estimated the volumes affected by today's 
rule. A total of 295,000 tons per year of organic TC wastes 
(D018-D043) are affected by today's rule; this volume includes 
167,000 tons per year of nonwastewaters, 94,000 tons per year of 
hazardous soil, and 34,000 tons per year of hazardous debris. 
The volume estimates used in the capacity analysis differ, as 
described above, from those estimates employed in the regulatory 
analysis. See the regulatory analysis background document for a 
more detailed discussion of these differences. 
In addition, there are 30 tons per year of Chlorotoluene 
wastes affected by today's rule. The Agency also estimates that 
9,760 tons per year of K069 waste will be affected as a result of 
the hazardous waste recycling exemption. 


b. Cost Results 


Exhibit XVI-1 summarizes the results of the cost analysis 
for today's final rule. In total, today's final rule would have 
an incremental annual cost of between $194 and $219 million. The 
lower bound cost estimate represents the effects of waste 
minimization compliance cost savings. In addition, there is a 
potential cost savings associated with the UTS standards and the 
hazardous waste recycling exemption of $2.1 million per year.

i. Organic TC Wastes 



As described above, EPA conducted a facility specific cost 
analysis for those facilities managing organic TC waste. The 
incremental costs for the TC wastes, presented in Exhibit XVI-1, 
are between $191 and $216 million per year. Sixty-seven percent 
of the total cost, in the upper bound, is for the treatment of 
organic TC nonwastewaters, and 16 percent and 17 percent is for 
the treatment of organic TC contaminated soil and debris, 
respectively. 



ii. Other Newly Regulated Wastes 



Since current management practices show that no coke by-product wastes are landfilled, as a result of the coke by-product

listing rule (August 18, 1992, at 57 FR 37284), EPA estimates 
that there are no cost impacts associated with the treatment 
standards for coke by-product wastes. The incremental cost for 
chlorinated toluenes is estimated to be less than $0.1 million 
annually. 



iii. Testing, Recordkeeping, Permit Modification Costs 



The analysis of the testing requirements in today's rule 
estimates incremental costs of approximately $3 million per year. 
The costs for the recordkeeping requirements were estimated to be 
approximately $490,000 per year. These costs are described in 
more detail in the Regulatory Impact Analysis background document 
developed for today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's 
docket. 



c. Waste Minimization

Through the methodology outlined above, the Agency analyzed 
the cost implications of waste management alternatives involving 
waste minimization in today's rule. The analysis shows that 
there is a potential savings of $25 million per year quantifiable 
in comparing current management practices to waste minimization 
activities which could be implemented. The Agency presents the 
cost impact of today's rule as a range from $0 to $25 million per 
year, representing the cost savings possible through waste 
minimization activities. 
In performing the waste minimization analysis, the Agency 
focused on specific process for two industries for which data 
were available. This approach allowed the analysis to be 
detailed in nature, providing a close examination of facility 
compliance alternatives. However, in doing so, the Agency 
believes it has underestimated the potential savings due to waste 
minimization. In addition, the Agency has not attempted to 
address any further source reduction, waste minimization, or 
innovative technology development which may result from today's 
rule. 


d. Economic Impact Results 


For the 14 companies with non-commercial, or captive, 
landfills that receive the company's waste (from the TC Survey), 
only one company would have a ratio of incremental compliance 
cost to cost of operations greater than one-half percent; all 
other facilities would experience even lower economic impacts 
resulting from today's rule. 
Since no costs are associated with the treatment standards for 
coke by-products, no economic impacts are expected. Based on a 
ratio analysis of incremental cost to total sales, none of the 
chlorinated toluene generating facilities is expected to 
experience significant impacts as a result of the final rule. 


e. Benefit Estimate Results 


The benefit estimates for today's rule include both reduction 
in risk to human health, as well as incremental cost savings. 
Cost savings are estimated for the Universal Treatment Standards 
(UTS), cost savings resulting from changes to the hazardous waste 
recycling exemptions. Human health benefits are estimated for 
cancer and non-cancer risks. 
However, there are some benefits which the Agency has not 
attempted to quantify which are potentially attributable to 
today's rule. For example, the Agency has not attempted to 
quantify any potential non-use value benefits from protection of 
resources through treatment of hazardous wastes. 

Furthermore, the risk analysis performed by the Agency for 
today's rule does not account for many other potential benefits 
from today's rule. Ecological risk reduction from treatment of 
wastes under today's rule has not been quantified. Nor do the 
Agency's air and groundwater benefit estimates account for karst 
terrain, complex flow situations, or other factors which could contribute 
to underestimates of benefits. These unquantified benefits are 
discussed at greater length in the regulatory impact background 
document for today's rule. 



i. Universal Treatment Standards Analysis 


The Agency's analysis of the cost impacts realized due to the 
Universal Treatment Standards requiring/allowing a change in 
treatment technology from that required under the existing 
standards produced a cost savings of approximately $100,000 per 
year. The only wastes for which the Agency found that the UTS 
standards required/allowed a change in treatment were the cyanide 
wastes. 

The Agency received a number of favorable comments on the 
adoption of the UTS standards. These commenters stated that the 
UTS would allow them to save much more in operation costs than 
the Agency has quantified in the above analysis. One commenter 
stated that they would save approximately $366,000 annually and 
1736 hours per year in manhour savings associated with the UTS 
for F024. And another commenter stated that they would save 
approximately $740,000 per year as a result of the UTS. A more 
thorough description of these cost savings is shown in the Regulatory Impact Analysis background document developed
for 
today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's docket. 



ii. Hazardous Waste Recycling Exemption 


The analysis performed by the Agency for the cost impacts 
associated with the recycling exemption for K069 produced a 
savings of approximately $2 million per year. A detailed 
description of the cost savings for K069 is shown in the 
Regulatory Impact Analysis background document developed for 
today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's docket. 


iii. Results_Groundwater Pathway 



This section presents results for the baseline and post-regulatory risk analyses. For each case, results for individual

cancer and non-cancer risk are presented for both high end (i.e. 
the 90th percentile of the distribution) and central tendency 
(i.e. 50th percentile of the distribution) risk estimates. The 
section concludes with population risk estimates for cancer 
risks.
 
The results, presented in full in the RIA background document 
which is included in the docket for today's rule, show that the 
central tendency cancer risk estimate is expected to be zero. 
The high-end individual cancer risk is 4  x  10

^7

. For the post-regulatory scenario, EPA assumed that all constituents would be 
treated to universal standards. For the post-regulatory case, 
the central tendency risk estimate is zero, and the high-end risk 
estimate is 3  x  10

^6

.

Using the distribution of individual risks, the Agency 
calculated baseline and post-regulatory cancer population risks. 
Based on these assumptions, EPA estimates the baseline population 
cancer risk to be 0.24 cases per year in the central tendency. 
The post-regulatory population cancer risk is about 0.02 cases 
per year in the central tendency. In other words, the regulatory 
option reduces 0.22 cases per year in the central tendency. 
For the non-cancer risks, the analysis shows that the 99th 
percentile baseline exposure level is less than the reference 
dose, using central tendency assumptions. The population risk 
estimates show 2000 people, in the central tendency scenario, who 
are exposed to non-cancer risk above the threshold. 

There are a number of limitations to the groundwater pathway 
analysis. The timeframe to which these benefits are attributable 
begins 30 years following promulgation of the rule. The analysis 
does not account for any existing regulations which would 
mitigate risks from groundwater (e.g., Clean Water Act). In 
addition, one of the wastestreams which contributes a large 
proportion of the groundwater population risk is made up 
primarily of PCBs, which are not expected to migrate any 
appreciable distance in groundwater. The DAF used in the 
analysis was calculated based on drinking wells being within one 
mile of the facility, and was not adjusted to accord with the 
population estimates used in the analysis which are based on a 
two-mile distance. The DAF distribution is not constituent-specific and accounts only for homogeneous flow situations.

This section provides results for the air pathway, for the 
baseline and post-regulatory scenarios. 
It should be noted that the high end scenario models hypothetical receptors. Approximately 26 of the 35 modeled facilities
(74 percent) 
have individual cancer risks exceeding 10

^6

 for the high end 
scenario in the baseline. For the high end scenario, the non-cancer risk ratio exceeds one at one facility. 
In the post-regulatory scenario, individual cancer risk is 
lowered considerably, indicating that at most of the facilities 
risk is driven by TC constituents. In the high end scenario, 
eight facility(s) have risks exceeding 10

^6

. Doses of all non-carcinogens are well below reference doses. 
For the population risk estimates, the Agency determined that 
the central tendency incremental benefits are approximately 
0.037. For the incremental benefits of today's rule, the Agency 
performed a sensitivity analysis, described in the RIA background 
document, which examines the risk implications of changing 
volatilization rates under different assumptions of landfill 
cover and frequency of waste placement.

There are a number of limitations to the air pathway analysis. 
Facilities which were modeled in the analysis were assumed to 
continue to dispose of treated waste on-site, which, for some 
facilities, may not be the case. In addition, due to limitations 
in the model employed, wastes were assumed to be disposed of only one time per year. A sensitivity analysis was conducted
and is 
included in the RIA Background Document, which examines the 
effect on the emissions rate from this assumption. Finally, only 
wastestreams with all the necessary information were analyzed. 
This limitation could have the effect of either under- or 
overestimating the risks from the air pathway. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 
601 

et seq.

, when an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking, for 
a rule that will have a significant effect on a substantial 
number of small entities, the agency must prepare and make 
available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis 
that considers the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e.: 
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental 
jurisdictions). Under the Agency's Revised Guidelines for 
Implementing The Regulatory Flexibility Act, dated May 4, 1992, 
the Agency committed to considering regulatory alternatives in 
rulemakings when there were any economic impacts estimated on any 
small entities. Previous guidance required regulatory 
alternatives to be examined only when significant economic 
effects were estimated on a substantial number of small entities. 
In assessing the regulatory approach for dealing with small 
entities in today's final rule, for both surface disposal of 
wastes and underground injection control, the Agency considered 
two factors. First, data on potentially affected small entities 
are unavailable. Second, due to the statutory requirements of 
the RCRA LDR program, no legal avenues exist for the Agency to 
provide relief from the LDR's for small entities. The only 
relief available for small entities is the existing small 
quantity generator provisions and conditionally exempt small 
quantity generator exemptions found in 40 CFR 262.11-12, and 
261.5, respectively. These exemptions basically prescribe 100 
kilograms (kg) per calendar month generation of hazardous waste 
as the limit below which one is exempted from complying with the 
RCRA standards. 
Given these two factors, the Agency was unable to frame a 
series of small entity options from which to select the lowest 
cost approach; rather, the Agency was legally bound to regulate 
the land disposal of the hazardous wastes covered in today's rule 
without regard to the size of the entity being regulated. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements in this rule have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 


Paperwork Reduction Act,

 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. and have been 
assigned control number 2050-0085. This rule will reduce the 
average reporting burden an estimated 0.75 hours per response, 
due to decreased paperwork requirements. Send comments regarding 
the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of 
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to 
Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., S.W. (Mail Code 
2138); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, 
DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''

21. Section 268.7 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and 
(b)(4)(ii), and by adding paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to read as follows: 



 268.7 

Waste analysis and recordkeeping. 


(a) Except as specified in  268.32, if a generator's waste is 
listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D, the generator must test his 
waste, or test an extract using test method 1311 (the Toxicity 
Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in ``Test Methods for 
Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication 
SW-846 as incorporated by reference in  260.11 of this chapter), or 
use knowledge of the waste, to determine if the waste is restricted 
from land disposal under this part. Except as specified in  268.32, 
if a generator's waste exhibits one or more of the characteristics set 
out at 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the generator must test an extract 
using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching 
Procedure, described in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, 
Physical/Chemical Methods'' (SW-846)), or use knowledge of the waste, 
to determine if the waste is restricted from land disposal under this 
Part. If the generator determines that his waste exhibits the 
characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC 
Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST or RORGS of  
268.42, Table 1), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002), and is 
prohibited under  268.37; and/or the characteristic of 
organic toxicity (D012-D043), and is prohibited under  268.38, the 
generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as 
defined in  268.2, in the D001, D002, or D012-D043 wastes. 
(1) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted 
waste under this part and the waste does not meet the applicable 
treatment standards set forth in Subpart D of this part or exceeds the 
applicable prohibition levels set forth in  268.32 or RCRA section 
3004(d), with each shipment of waste the generator must notify the 
treatment or storage facility in writing of the appropriate treatment 
standards set forth in Subpart D of this part and any applicable 
prohibition levels set forth in  268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). The 
notice must include the following information: 
(i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(ii) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if 
monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes 
F001-F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012-D043. Generators must also 
include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined 
in  268.2(d) and (f), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such 
as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; 
(iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 

(iv) For hazardous debris when using the alternative treatment 
technologies provided by  268.45: 
(A) The contaminants subject to treatment, as described in  
268.45(b); and 
(B) An indication that these contaminants are being treated to 
comply with  268.45. 
(v) For hazardous debris when using the treatment standards for 
the contaminating waste(s) in  268.40: the requirements described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi) of this section.
(2) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted 
waste under this Part, and determines that the waste can be land 
disposed without further treatment, with each shipment of waste he 
must submit, to the treatment, storage, or land disposal facility, a 
notice and a certification stating that the waste meets the applicable 
treatment standards set forth in subpart D of this part and the 
applicable prohibition levels set forth in  268.32 or RCRA section 
3004(d). Generators of hazardous debris that is excluded from the 
definition of hazardous waste under  261.3(e)(2) of this chapter 
(i.e., debris that the Director has determined does not contain 
hazardous waste), however, are not subject to these notification and 
certification requirements. 
(i) The notice must include the following information: 
(A) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(B) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if 
monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes 
F001-F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012-D043. Generators must also 
include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined 
in  268.2 (d) and (f)), and indicate the subcategory of the waste (such 
as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; 
(C) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 
(D) Waste analysis data, where available. 
(ii) The certification must be signed by an authorized 
representative and must state the following:



I certify under penalty 
of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste 
through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to 
support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment 
standards specified in 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D and all applicable 
prohibitions set forth in 40 CFR 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). I 
believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate and 
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for 
submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine 
and imprisonment.

 

(3) If a generator's waste is subject to an exemption from a 
prohibition on the type of land disposal method utilized for the waste 
(such as, but not limited to, a case-by-case extension under  268.5, 
an exemption under  268.6, or a nationwide capacity variance under 
subpart C of this part), with each shipment of waste he must submit a notice to the 
facility receiving his waste stating that the waste is not prohibited 
from land disposal. The notice must include the following information: 
(i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number; 
(ii) The waste constituents that the treater will monitor, if 
monitoring will not include all regulated constituents, for wastes 
F001-F005, F039, D001, D002, and D012-D043. Generators must also 
include whether the waste is a nonwastewater or wastewater (as defined 
in  268.2 (d) and (f)), and indicate the subcategory of the waste 
(such as ``D003 reactive cyanide''), if applicable; 
(iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste; 
(iv) Waste analysis data, where available; 
(v) For hazardous debris when using the alternative treatment 
technologies provided by  268.45:

(A) The contaminants subject to treatment, as described in  
268.45(b); and 
(B) An indication that these contaminants are being treated to 
comply with  268.45. 
(vi) For hazardous debris when using the treatment standards for 
the contaminating waste(s) in  268.40: the requirements described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi) of this section. 
(4) If a generator is managing prohibited waste in tanks, 
containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40 CFR 262.34, 
and is treating such waste in such tanks, containers, or containment 
buildings to meet applicable treatment standards under subpart D of 
this part, the generator must develop and follow a written waste 
analysis plan which describes the procedures the generator will carry 
out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating 
hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1, 
 268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis 
requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's 
records, and the following requirements must be met: 
(i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical 
and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited 
waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat 
the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this Part, 
including the selected testing frequency. 
(ii) Such plan must be filed with the EPA Regional Administrator 
(or his designated representative) or State authorized to implement 
Part 268 requirements a minimum of 30 days prior to the treatment 
activity, with delivery verified. 
(iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must 
comply with the notification requirements of  268.7(a)(2). 
(5) If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted 
based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used 
to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's 
files. If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted based 
on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method 
described in Appendix I of this part, all waste analysis data must be 
retained on-site in the generator's files. 
(6) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted 
waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste 
or exempt from Subtitle C regulation, under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6 
subsequent to the point of generation, he must place a one-time notice 
stating such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of 
hazardous or solid waste or exemption from RCRA Subtitle C regulation, and 
the disposition of the waste, in the facility's file. 
(7) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, 
certifications, demonstrations, waste analysis data, and other 
documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least five 
years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such 
documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, 
or disposal. The five year record retention period is automatically 
extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action 
regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. 
The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the 
hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the 
waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste 
under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6, or exempted from RCRA Subtitle C regulation, 
subsequent to the point of generation. 
(8) If a generator is managing a lab pack waste and wishes to use 
the alternative treatment standard under  268.42(c), with each 
shipment of waste the generator must submit a notice to the treatment 
facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except 
that underlying hazardous constituents need not be determined. The 
generator must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) 
and (a)(6) of this section and must submit the following 
certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative:

 

I certify under penalty of law that I personally have 
examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab 
pack contains only wastes which have not been excluded under 
appendix IV to 40 CFR part 268 or solid wastes not subject 
to regulation under 40 CFR part 261. I am aware that there 
are significant penalties for submitting a false 
certification, including the possibility of fine or 
imprisonment.

 

(9) [Reserved]
(10) Small quantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant 
to 40 CFR 262.20(e) must comply with the applicable notification and 
certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the 
initial shipment of the waste subject to the agreement. Such 
generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification and 
certification, together with the tolling agreement, for at least three 
years after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three-year 
record retention period is automatically extended during the course of 
any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or 
as requested by the Administrator.

expressed as a required method of treatment); that are reasonably 
expected to contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined in  268.2(i); are treated on-site to remove
the hazardous characteristic; 
and are then sent off-site for treatment of underlying hazardous constituents, the certification must state the
following: 




I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been 
treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 
to remove the hazardous characteristic. This 
decharacterized waste contains underlying hazardous 
constituents that require further treatment to meet 
universal treatment standards. I am aware that there are 
significant penalties for submitting a false certification, 
including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.

22. In  268.9, paragraph (a), (d)(1)(i), and (d)(1)(ii) are 
revised, (d)(1)(iii) is removed and (d)(2) (i) and (ii) are added to 
read as follows: 



 268.9 

Special rules regarding wastes that exhibit a 
characteristic. 



(a) The initial generator of a solid waste must determine each 
EPA Hazardous Waste Number (waste code) applicable to the waste in 
order to determine the applicable treatment standards under subpart D 
of this part. For purposes of part 268, the waste will carry the 
waste code for any applicable listing under 40 CFR part 261, subpart 
D. In addition, the waste will carry one or more of the waste codes 
under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, where the waste exhibits a 
characteristic, except in the case when the treatment standard for the 
waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D operates in lieu of 
the treatment standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, 
subpart C, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the 
generator determines that his waste displays the characteristic of 
ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High TOC Ignitable Liquids 
Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST, or RORGS), or the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D operates in lieu
of the treatment standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
If the generator determines that his waste displays the characteristic of ignitability (D001) (and is not in the High
TOC Ignitable Liquids Subcategory or is not treated by CMBST, or RORGS), or the characteristic of corrosivity (D002),
and is prohibited under  268.37; or that his waste displays the characteristic of toxicity 
(D012-D043), and is prohibited under  268.38, the generator must 
determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in  268.2), in the D001, D002, or D012-D043
wastes. 



* * * * * 



(d) * * * 

(1) * * * 

(i) Name and address of the RCRA Subtitle D facility receiving the 
waste shipment; and 

(ii) A description of the waste as initially generated, including 
the applicable EPA Hazardous Waste Number(s), treatability group(s), 
and underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in  268.2(i) in 
D001 and D002 wastes prohibited under  268.37, or D012-D043 wastes 
under  268.38. 

(2) * * *

underlying hazardous constituents, then the certification found in  
268.7 (b)(5)(v) apply.

contaminated with EPA Hazardous Waste numbers F037, F038, K107-K112, 
K117, K118, K123-K126, K131, K132, K136, U328, U353, U359, and soil 
and debris contaminated with D012-D043, K141-K145, and K147-K151 
are prohibited from land disposal. The following wastes that are 
specified in 40 CFR 261.24, Table 1 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers: 
D012, D013, D014, D015, D016, D017, D018, D019, D020, D021, D022, 
D023, D024, D025, D026, D027, D028, D029, D030, D031, D032, D033, 
D034, D035, D036, D037, D038, D039, D040, D041, D042, D043 that are 
not radioactive, or that are managed in systems other than those whose 
discharge is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), or that are 
zero dischargers that do not engage in CWA-equivalent treatment before 
ultimate land disposal, or that are injected in Class I deep wells 
regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), are prohibited 
from land disposal. CWA-equivalent treatment means biological 
treatment for organics, alkaline chlorination or ferrous sulfate 
precipitation for cyanide, precipitation/ sedimentation for metals, 
reduction of hexavalent chromium, or other treatment technology that 
can be demonstrated to perform equally or better than these 
technologies. 

(b) On September 19, 1996, radioactive wastes that are mixed with D018-D043 that are managed in systems other
than those whose discharge is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), or that inject in Class I deep wells regulated
under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), or that are zero 
dischargers that engage in CWA-equivalent treatment before ultimate 
land disposal, are prohibited from land disposal. CWA-equivalent 
treatment means biological treatment for organics, alkaline 
chlorination or ferrous sulfate precipitation for cyanide, 
precipitation/ sedimentation for metals, reduction of hexavalent 
chromium, or other treatment technology that can be demonstrated to 
perform equally or greater than these technologies. Radioactive 
wastes mixed with K141-K145, and K147-K151 are also prohibited 
from land disposal. In addition, soil and debris contaminated with 
these radioactive mixed wastes are prohibited from land disposal. 

(c) Between December 19, 1994 and September 19, 1996, the wastes included in paragraphs (b) of this section may 
be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment, only if such unit is 
in compliance with the requirements specified in  268.5(h)(2) of this 
Part. 

(d) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section do not apply if: 

(1) The wastes meet the applicable treatment standards specified 
in Subpart D of this part; 

(2) Persons have been granted an exemption from a prohibition 
pursuant to a petition under  268.6, with respect to those wastes and 
units covered by the petition; 

(3) The wastes meet the applicable alternate treatment standards 
established pursuant to a petition granted under  268.44; 

(4) Persons have been granted an extension to the effective date 
of a prohibition pursuant to  268.5, with respect to these wastes 
covered by the extension. 

(e) To determine whether a hazardous waste identified in this 
section exceeds the applicable treatment standards specified in  
268.40, the initial generator must test a sample of the waste extract 
or the entire waste, depending on whether the treatment standards are 
expressed as concentrations in the waste extract or the waste, or the 
generator may use knowledge of the waste. If the waste contains 
constituents in excess of the applicable Subpart D levels, the waste 
is prohibited from land disposal, and all requirements of part 268 are 
applicable, except as otherwise specified. 



Subpart D_Treatment Standards 




24. Section 268.40 is revised to read as follows: 



 268.40 

Applicability of Treatment Standards. 




(a) A waste identified in the table ``Treatment Standards for 
Hazardous Wastes'' may be land disposed only if it meets the 
requirements found in the table. For each waste, the table identifies 
one of three types of treatment standard requirements: 

(1) All hazardous constituents in the waste or in the treatment 
residue must be at or below the values found in the table for that 
waste (``total waste standards''); or 

(2) The hazardous constituents in the extract of the waste or in 
the extract of the treatment residue must be at or below the values 
found in the table (``waste extract standards''); or

<DOCNO> FR940919-0-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 (3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in 
the table (``technology standard''), which are described in detail in  
268.42, Table 1_Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based 
Standards. 

 (b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level 
standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004 
through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment 
standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all 
nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based 
on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards, 
the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure 
found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical 
Methods'', EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in  
260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for 
D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used: 
Method 1311, or Method 1310, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test. 

For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land 
disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an 
equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under 
the procedures set forth in  268.42(b). 

 (c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a 
constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the 
treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the 
constituent of concern. 

 (d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate 
(and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the 
treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote 
in the table ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes'' in this 
section, provided the following conditions are satisfied: 

 (1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were 
established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with 
the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on 
combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with 
applicable technical requirements; 

 (2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods 
referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic 
constituents; and 

 (3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate 
compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts 
achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that 
do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an 
order of magnitude. 

 (e) For characteristic wastes (D001, D002, and D012-D043 that 
are subject to treatment standards in the following table ``Treatment 
Standards for Hazardous Wastes,'' all underlying hazardous constituents 
(as defined in  268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards, 
found in  268.48, Table UTS, prior to land disposal. 

 (f) The treatment standards for F001-F005 nonwastewater 
constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to 
wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents. 
Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract 
from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure 
found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical 
Methods'', EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in  
260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along 
with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001-F005, then 
compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide, 
cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act) for the Conservancy fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta conservatio

), longhorn fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta longiantenna

), and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (

Lepidurus packardi

); and threatened status for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta lynchi

). These four invertebrate species are restricted to vernal pools in the State of California and are in danger of extinction
principally as the result of urban development, conversion of native habitats to agriculture, and stochastic (random)
extinction by virtue of the small isolated nature of many of the remaining populations. This rule implements Federal
protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act for all of these animals.



One species, the California linderiella (

Linderiella occidentalis

), which had been proposed for listing with the above species, has been withdrawn. Additional information that has
become available to the Service since the publication of the proposed rule reveals that this species is more abundant
than previously known. The Service has considered the additional information and has determined that the California
linderiella is not likely to become either endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its
range in the foreseeable future, and it does not qualify for listing under the Act. A notice withdrawing the proposal
is published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrently with this final rule.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool fairy shrimp are members of the aquatic crustacean
order Anostraca. The vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a member of the aquatic crustacean order Notostraca. They are endemic
to vernal pools in the Central Valley, coast ranges, and a limited number of sites in the Transverse Range and Santa
Rosa Plateau of California.

The three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp live in vernal pools, an ephemeral freshwater habitat. None
are known to occur in riverine waters, marine waters, or other permanent bodies of water. They are ecologically dependent
on seasonal fluctuations in their habitat, such as absence or presence of water during specific times of the year,
duration of inundation, and other environmental factors that include specific salinity, conductivity, dissolved
solids, and pH levels. Water chemistry is one of the most important factors in determining the distribution of fairy
shrimp and tadpole shrimp (Belk 1977; Jamie King, University of California, 

in litt.

, 1992; Marie Simovich, University of San Diego, 

in litt.

, 1992). The four species included in this final rule are sporadic in their distribution, often inhabiting only one
or a few pools in otherwise more widespread vernal pool complexes (Larry Eng, California Department of Fish and Game,
pers. comm., 1990; Jamie King, 

in litt.

, 1992; Marie Simovich, 

in litt.

, 1992; Richard Brusca, San Diego Museum of Natural History, pers. comm., 1992).

Fairy shrimp have delicate elongate bodies, large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming legs.
They swim or glide gracefully upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like
anterior to posterior direction. Nearly all fairy shrimp feed on algae, bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, and bits of
detritus (Pennak 1989). The second pair of antennae in the adult females are cylindrical and elongate, but in the males
are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the females during copulation. The females carry the eggs in an
oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either dropped to the pool bottom or remain in the brood sac until the
female dies and sinks. The ``resting'' or ``summer'' eggs are capable of withstanding heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation.
When the pools refill in the same or subsequent seasons some, but not all, of the eggs may hatch. The egg bank in the soil
may be comprised of the eggs from several years of breeding (Donald 1983). The eggs hatch when the vernal pools fill
with rainwater. The early stages of the fairy shrimp develop rapidly into adults. These non-dormant populations
often disappear early in the season long before the vernal pools dry up.
Tadpole shrimp have dorsal compound eyes, a large shield-like carapace that covers most of the body, and a pair of long
cercopods at the end of the last abdominal segment (Brusca and Brusca 1991; Pennak 1989; Linder 1952; Longhurst 1955a;
Lynch 1966, 1972). They are primarily benthic animals that swim with their legs down. Tadpole shrimp climb or scramble
over objects, as well as plow along in bottom sediments. Their diet consists of organic detritus and living organisms,
such as fairy shrimp and other invertebrates (Pennak 1989; Fryer 1987). Mating in tadpole shrimp is described by Longhurst
(1955b). The females deposit their eggs on vegetation and other objects on the bottom. Vernal pool tadpole shrimp
populations pass the dry summer months as diapaused eggs in pool sediments. Some of the eggs hatch as the vernal pools
are filled with rainwater in the fall and winter of subsequent seasons.
Vernal pools have a discontinuance occurrence in several regions of California. Generally vernal pool habitat is
found west of the Sierra Nevada and extends from southern Oregon into northern Baja, California (Holland and Jain
1977, 1988). Vernal pools form in regions with Mediterranean climates where shallow depressions fill with water
during fall and winter rains and then evaporate in the spring (Collie and Lathrop 1976; Holland 1976, 1978; Holland
and Jain 1977, 1988; Norwick 1992; Thorne 1984). Overbank flooding from intermittent streams may augment the amount
of water in some vernal pools (Hanes 

et al. 

1990). Downward percolation is prevented by the presence of an impervious subsurface layer, such as a claypan, hardpan,
or volcanic stratum (Holland 1976, 1988). Due to local topography and geology, the pools are usually clustered into
pool complexes (Holland and Jain 1988). Pools within a complex typically are separated by distances on the order of
meters and may form dense, interconnected mosaics of small pools or a more sparse scattering of larger pools. Temporary
inundation makes vernal pools too wet during the wetted period for adjacent upland plant species adapted to drier
soil conditions, while rapid drying during late spring makes pool basins unsuitable for typical marsh or aquatic
species that require a more permanent source of water. However, many indigenous plant and aquatic invertebrate species
have evolved to occupy the extreme environmental conditions found in vernal pool habitats. Fairy shrimp and tadpole
shrimp play an important role in the community ecology of many ephemeral water bodies (R. Brusca, pers. comm., 1992;
Loring 

et al. 

1988). They are fed upon by waterfowl (Ahl 1991; Driver 1981; Krapu 1974; Swanson 

et al. 

1974) and other vertebrates, such as western spadefoot toad (

Scaphiopus hammondi

) tadpoles (M. Simovich, pers. comm., 1991).
The genetic characteristics of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, as well as ecological conditions,
such as watershed contiguity, indicate that populations of these animals are defined by pool complexes rather than
by individual vernal pools (Fugate 1992; J. King, unpubl. data). Therefore, the most accurate indication of the distribution
and abundance of the four vernal pool crustaceans is the number of inhabited vernal pool complexes. Individual vernal
pools occupied by the four species listed herein are most appropriately referred to as subpopulations.
Urban, water, flood control, highway, and utility projects, as well as conversion of wildlands to agricultural use,
have eliminated vernal pools in southern California (Riverside and San Diego Counties), the Central Valley, and
San Francisco Bay area (Jones and Stokes Associates 1987). Changes in hydrologic pattern, overgrazing, and off-road
vehicle use also imperil this aquatic habitat and the four species listed herein. Human activities that alter the
watershed of vernal pools indirectly affect these animals. The flora and fauna in vernal pools or swales can change
if the hydrologic regime is altered (Bauder 1986, 1987). Anthropogenic activities that reduce the extent of the watershed
or that alter runoff patterns (i.e., amounts and seasonal distribution) may eliminate the animals, reduce their
population sizes or reproductive success, or shift the location of sites inhabited by these animals.
According to Holland (1978), there were an estimated 1.7 million hectares (4.2 million acres) in the Central Valley
that possibly supported vernal pools at the time Europeans arrived in California. Holland estimated that between
67 and 88 percent of this acreage was destroyed by 1973, largely by human activities (Holland 1978). However, both
the acreage of historic vernal pool habitat and estimates of loss determined in this study have been disputed by others.
Vernal pools in southern California have been highly impacted by human activities (Zedler 1987). The rate of loss
of vernal pool habitat in parts of California has been estimated to occur at approximately 2 or 3 percent per year (Holland
1988).

Discussion of the Four Species


The Conservancy fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta conservatio

), a member of the family Branchinetidae, was described from specimens collected at the Jepson Prairie Preserve,
located in the Central Valley east of Travis Air Force Base in Solano County (Eng 

et al.

 1990). The animal ranges in size from 14 to 27 millimeters (0.6 to 1.1 inches) long and is most similar in appearance
to Lindahl's fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta lindahli

). However, the female brood pouch is fusiform and usually ends under abdominal segment 8 in the Conservancy fairy
shrimp, whereas the pouch is cylindrical and usually ends under segment 4 in Lindahl's fairy shrimp. The large, oval
pulvillus at the proximal end of the basal segment of the male antenna appears similar in both species, however, the
terminal end of the distal antennal segments of the Conservancy fairy shrimp are distinctive (Eng 

et al.

 1990).
The Conservancy fairy shrimp inhabits vernal pools with highly turbid water. The species is known from six disjunct
populations: Vina Plains, Tehama County; south of Chico, Tehama County; Jepson Prairie, Solano County; Sacramento
National Wildlife Refuge, Glenn County (Joe Silviera, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993), near Haystack
Mountain northeast of Merced in Merced County; and the Lockewood Valley of northern Ventura County (Michael Fugate,
University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1991). The pools inhabited by the Conservancy fairy shrimp are
large, such as the 36 hectare (89 acre) Olcott Lake at Jepson Prairie (Eng, pers. comm., 1990). The Conservancy fairy
shrimp has been observed from November to early April. The pools at Jepson Prairie and Vina Plains inhabited by this
animal have very low conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinity (Barclay and Knight 1984; Eng 

et al.

 1990). The Conservancy fairy shrimp is usually collected at cool temperatures and appears to be relatively long-lived
(Simovich 

et al.

 1992; Patton 1984).
The longhorn fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta longiantenna

), a member of the family Branchinectidae, was described from specimens collected at Souza Ranch in the Kellogg Creek
watershed, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of the City of Concord, Contra Costa County (Eng 

et al.

 1990). It ranges in size from 12.1 to 20.8 mm (0.5 to 0.8 inches). This species differs from other branchinectids in
that a portion of the distal segment of its antennae is flattened in the antero-posterior plane rather than the latero-medial
plane.
The longhorn fairy shrimp inhabits clear to turbid grass-bottomed vernal pools in grasslands and clear-water pools
in sandstone depressions. This species is known only from four disjunct populations along the eastern margin of the
central coast range from Concord, Contra Costa County south to Soda Lake in San Luis Obispo County: the Kellogg Creek
watershed, the Altamont Pass area, the western and northern boundaries of Soda Lake on the Carrizo Plain (Eng 

et al.

 1990), and Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the Central Valley (Dennis Woolington, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,


in litt.

 1993). All vernal pools inhabited by this species are filled by winter and spring rains and may remain inundated until
June. The longhorn fairy shrimp has been observed from late December until late April. The water is grassland pools
inhabited by this species has very low conductivity, TDS, and alkalinity (Eng 

et al.

 1990).
The vernal pool fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta lynchi

), a member of the family Branchinectidae, was described from specimens collected at Souza Ranch in the Kellogg Creek
watershed, Contra Costa County, California (Eng 

et al.

 1990). It ranges in size from 10.9 to 25.0 mm (0.4 to 1.0 inches). This species most resembles the Colorado fairy shrimp
(

Branchinecta coloradensis

). There are several differences in the antennae of the males of the two species, including the basal segment outgrowth
below and posterior to the pulvillus, which is ridge-like in the vernal pool fairy shrimp but is cylindrical and often
much larger in the Colorado fairy shrimp. The shorter brood pouch of the vernal pool fairy shrimp is pyriform, whereas
the longer one in the Colorado fairy shrimp is fusiform (Eng 

et al.

 1990).

Although the vernal pool fairy shrimp has a relatively wide range, the majority of known populations inhabit vernal
pools with clear to tea-colored water, most commonly in grass or mud bottomed swales, or basalt flow depression pools
in unplowed grasslands, but one population occurs in sandstone rock outcrops and another population in alkaline
vernal pools. The vernal pool fairy shrimp has been collected from early December to early May. The water in pools inhabited
by this species has low TDS, conductivity, alkalinity, and chloride (Collie and Lathrop 1976). This species has a
sporadic distribution within vernal pool complexes (Jones and Stokes, 1992, 1993; County of Sacramento 1990; Patton
1984; Stromberg 1993; Sugnet and Associates 1993b) wherein the majority of pools in a given complex typically are
not inhabited by the species. Simovich 

et al. 

(1992) reported that the vernal pool fairy shrimp typically is found at low population densities. Only rarely does
the vernal pool fairy shrimp co-occur with other fairy shrimp species, but where it does, the vernal pool fairy shrimp
is never the numerically dominant one (Eng 

et al. 

1990). Although it can mature quickly, allowing populations to persist in short-lived shallow pools, it also persists
later into the spring where pools are longer lasting (Simovich 

et al. 

1992). Sugnet and Associates (1993b) listed 178 records for the species out of 3092 ``discrete locations'' containing
potential habitat in their report. These 178 records represent the 32 known populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp,
which extend from Stillwater Plain in Shasta County through most of the length of the Central Valley to Pixley in Tulare
County, and along the central coast range from northern Solano County to Pinnacles in San Benito County (Eng 

et al.

 1990; M. Fugate, pers. comm., 1991; Sugnet & Associates 1993b). Five of these populations are believed to be comprised
of a single inhabited pool. Four additional, disjunct populations exist; one near Soda Lake in San Luis Obispo County,
one in the mountain grasslands of northern Santa Barbara County, one near the Santa Rosa Plateau in Riverside County,
and one near Rancho California in Riverside County. Three of these four isolated populations contain only a single
known pool occupied by the vernal pool fairy shrimp.
The vernal pool tadpole shrimp (

Lepidurus packardi

), a member of the family Triopsidae, was described by Eugene Simon in 1866 (Longhurst 1955a). Longhurst (1955a) placed
the name in synonymy with 

Lepidurus apus. 

Subsequently, Lynch (1972) examined the taxa and determined that 

Lepidurus packardi 

is a valid species. The Service accepts Lynch's taxonomic treatment of the genus 

Lepidurus, 

which maintains 

L. packardi

 as a species.

Vernal pool tadpole shrimp adults reach a length of 50 millimeters (2 inches). They have about 35 pairs of legs and two
long cercopods. This species superficially resembles the ricefield tadpole shrimp (

Triops longicaudatus

). However, 

Lepidurus 

possess a flat paddle-shaped supra-anal plate that is entirely lacking in members of the genus 

Triops

 (Pennak 1989; R. Brusca 

in litt.,

 1992; M. Simovich 

in litt.,

 1992; J. King 

in litt.,

 1992). The vernal pool tadpole shrimp is known from 18 populations in the Central Valley, ranging from east of Redding
in Shasta County south through the Central Valley to the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge in Merced County, and from
a single vernal pool complex located on the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Fremont, Alameda
County.

The vernal pool tadpole shrimp inhabits vernal pools containing clear to highly turbid water, ranging in size from
5 square meters (54 square feet) in the Mather Air Force Base area of Sacramento County, to the 36 hectare (89 acre) Olcott
Lake at Jepson Prairie. The pools at Jepson Prairie and Vina Plains have a very low conductivity, TDS, and alkalinity
(Barclay and Knight 1984; Eng 

et al. 

1990). These pools are located most commonly in grass bottomed swales of grasslands in old alluvial soils underlain
by hardpan or in mud-bottomed pools containing highly turbid water.

The life history of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is linked to the phenology of the vernal pool habitat. After winter
rainwater fills the pools, the populations are reestablished from diapaused eggs that lie dormant in the dry pool
sediments (Ahl 1991; Lanway 1974). Ahl (1991) found that eggs in one pool hatched within three weeks of inundation
and maturated to sexually reproductive adults in another three to four weeks. Simovich 

et al.

 (1992) reported sexually mature adults occurred in another pool three to four weeks after the pools had been filled.
A female surviving to large size may lay up to six clutches of eggs, totaling about 861 eggs in her lifetime (Ahl 1991).
The eggs are sticky and readily adhere to plant matter and sediment particles (Simovich 

et al. 

1992). A portion of the eggs hatch immediately and the rest enter diapause and remain in the soil to hatch during later
rainy seasons (Ahl 1991). The vernal pool tadpole shrimp matures slowly and is a long-lived species (Ahl 1991; Alexander
1976). Adults are often present and reproductive until the pools dry up in the spring (Ahl 1991; Simovich 

et al. 

1992).



Previous Federal Actions



Ms. Roxanne Bittman petitioned the Service to list the Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, vernal pool
fairy shrimp, and California linderiella as endangered species in a letter dated November 19, 1990, which was received
by the Service on November 20, 1990. Ms. Bittman submitted additional information on these species in a letter dated
November 20, 1990, which was received on November 26, 1990. On March 21, 1991, the Service made a 90-day finding that
the petition contained substantial information indicating that the action requested may be warranted. A notice
announcing this finding was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 30, 1991 (56 FR 426968).

Ms. Dee Warenycia petitioned the Service to list the vernal pool tadpole shrimp as an endangered species in a letter
dated April 28, 1991, which was received by the Service on April 30, 1991. On November 21, 1991, the Service determined
in the administrative 90-day finding that the petition contained substantial information that the action requested
may be warranted. On May 8, 1992, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 19856) to list the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp as endangered.



Summary of Comments and Recommendations



In the May 8, 1992, proposed rule (57 FR 19856) and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested
to submit factual reports or information that might assist the Service in determining whether these taxa warrant
listing. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, including affected planning departments, Federal agencies,
scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Notices of this
proposal were published in the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, San Francisco Chronicle, Monterey Herald, Chico Enterprise
Record, San Luis Obispo Telegram-Tribune, Santa Barbara News-Press, Modesto Bee, Sacramento Bee, and the Fresno
Bee on June 5, 1992.

On June 4, 1992, the Service received a written request for a public hearing from Mr. George Robson of the Tehama County
Planning Department. Several other requests for a public hearing also were received. As a result, on August 13, 1992,
the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 36380) announcing the public hearing and reopening the comment period until September 18, 1992. The Service
conducted a public hearing on August 31, 1992, at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. Testimony was taken
from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Twenty-one persons presented testimony.

On September 18, 1992, the Service attended a public meeting held at the Red Bluff Community Center in Red Bluff, Tehama
County, California. Six people presented oral and written comments to the Service.
During the comment periods, the Service received 117 comments (letters and oral testimony). Several people submitted
more than one comment to the Service. The Service received two petitions containing 63 signatures of people supporting
the listing and one petition containing 190 signatures of people opposed to the listing. The California Department
of Parks and Recreation supported a listing of threatened for the four fairy shrimp but did not state a position on the
vernal pool tadpole shrimp. The California Department of Fish and Game expressed concern for the fairy shrimp and
also did not state a position on the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Comments supporting the listing were received from
41 private parties, including the Riverside County Planning Department, and nine professional biologists from
several institutions, including the Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology, University of California,
University of San Diego, and San Diego Museum of Natural History. Comments opposing the listing were received from
34 private parties, organizations, and agencies including seven mosquito abatement districts. Opposition to the
listing also was expressed by Congressman Wally Herger and Congressman Vic Fazio. Four commenters did not express
an opinion.
In addition, after the comment period closed, six parties, including the California Department of Fish and Game,
requested that the Service extend the date of the final determination for the five species by six months pursuant to
16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6). The Act provides for a six-month extension if the Secretary finds that ``* * * there
is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination
* * * for the purposes of soliciting additional data.'' One of these commenters submitted a report
that summarized collection records and field work conducted in 1993 (Sugnet and Associates 1993b). The California
Department of Fish and Game supported the extension but stated that they had no additional information. The California
Native Plant Society opposed the six-month extension and urged the Service to immediately list the five species under
the Act.
The Service has reviewed all of the written and oral comments described above. Comments updating the data presented
in the ``Background'' or ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' are incorporated in those sections of this
final rule. Opposing comments and other comments concerning the rule have been organized into specific issues. These
issues and the Service's response to each are summarized as follows:


Issue 1: 

A number of commenters stated that a single public hearing was inadequate to obtain full public input on the proposal.
They requested that public hearings be held in all of the towns and counties that contain vernal pools and swales inhabited
by the five species.


Service Response: 

The Service is obligated to hold one public hearing on a listing proposal if requested to do so within 45 days of publication
of the proposal (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(5)(E)). In addition to the public hearing held on August 31, 1992, the Service attended
a public meeting organized by Congressman Vic Fazio in Red Bluff, on September 18, 1992. The public comment period
was extended to September 8, 1992, to allow all interested parties to provide written comments. In making a decision
on a listing proposal, written comments are given the same weight as oral comments presented at hearings.


Issue 2: 

Several respondents stated that the Service's notification of the public on this proposal was inadequate.


Service Response: 

The Service went through an extensive notification process to make the public aware of this proposal; this process
satisfied the requirements of the Act and is described at the beginning of this section.


Issue 3: 

Many respondents concluded that listing the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp would result in adverse
economic impacts to thousands of hectares of land and questioned the value of these animals to society. Two commenters
requested that an analysis of the economic impact of listing these species be completed. Two commenters noted that
these species are restricted to vernal pools but stated that listing would result in adverse economic impacts by eliminating
future residential or commercial development in areas containing this habitat. Five commenters claimed the fairy
shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are ``insignificant'' species and that listing would interfere with the
natural evolutionary process of extinction. On the other hand, a number of respondents asserted that opposition
to the listing of the species was based solely on economic interests. They cited the ecological and educational value
of vernal pool plants and animals. Four crustacean biologists noted the species can be considered ``living fossils''
and are of great scientific value to the study of biological evolution, systematics, and ecology.


Service Response: 

Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, a listing determination must be based solely on the best scientific and commercial
data available. The legislative history of this provision clearly states the intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that
listing decisions are ``based solely on biological criteria and to prevent non-biological criteria from effecting
such decisions'' H.R. Rep. No. 97-835, 97th Cong. 2d Sess. 19 (1982). As further stated in the legislative history,
``economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species.'' Because the Service
is specifically precluded from considering economic impacts in a final decision on a proposed listing, the Service
has not considered possible economic consequences of listing the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.
There may be many opinions as to a particular species' contribution to society, including their aesthetic, scientific,
or other significance, however, this contribution is not among the five factors upon which a listing determination
is based.

Issue 4:

 One commenter recommended that the Service prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on this rule. He stated that a decision to list these five crustaceans is a major Federal
action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment.


Service Response:

 For the reasons set out in the NEPA section of this document, the Service takes the position that rules issued pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Act do not require the preparation of an EIS. The courts held in 

Pacific Legal Foundation

 v. 

Andrus,

 657 F2d. 829 (6th Circuit 1981) that an EIS is not required for listing under the Act. The decision noted that preparing
EIS's on listing actions does not further the goals of NEPA or the Act.


Issue 5:

 One commenter requested that the Service conduct a Takings Implications Assessment under Executive Order 12630
for this listing action.


Service Response:

 The Attorney General has issued guidelines to the Department of the Interior (Department) regarding implementation
of Executive Order 12630.
The Attorney General's guidelines state that Taking Implications Assessments (TIAs), which are used to analyze
the potential for Fifth Amendment taking claims are to be prepared after, rather than before, an agency makes a decision
upon which its discretion is restricted. In enacting the Endangered Species Act, Congress required the Department
to list a species based solely upon scientific and commercial data indicating whether or not the species is in danger
of extinction. No discretion is afforded and the Service may not withhold a listing based upon economic concerns.
Therefore, even though a TIA is required, a TIA for a listing action is to be finalized only after the final decision
whether to list a species is made.


Issue 6:

 The California Department of parks and Recreation recommended that the four fairy shrimp should be listed as threatened
species rather than endangered species.


Service Response:

 The Service has determined that threatened status is appropriate for the vernal pool fairy shrimp. The proposal to
list the California linderiella as an endangered species has been withdrawn. The rationale for these actions and
endangered status for the two other fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is described at the conclusion
of the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section.


Issue 7:

 Several commenters expressed concern that it will be difficult or impossible to delist any or all of the crustaceans
listed herein.


Service Response:

 When the recovery goals for a species have been met, the Service may prepare a proposal to delist or reclassify it. The
process for delisting or reclassifying a species, allowed for at section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, is the same process
used for listing the species.


Issue 8:

 Three respondents stated that compared to other federally listed crustaceans, the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool
tadpole shrimp do not warrant listing under the Act.


Service Response:

 The claim that the status of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp do not warrant listing under the Act
when compared with other listed crustaceans does not address the full range of issues and complexities bearing on
listing decisions. The multiplicity of factors and relationships that must be considered and interpreted in assigning
the appropriate status to listed taxa is sufficiently complex that patterns of consistency may not be necessarily
agreed upon by all parties.


Issue 9:

 Several respondents stated that critical habitat should be designated for the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp.


Service Response:

 The Service believes that the danger posed by designating critical habitat at this time outweighs the potential benefits.
As discussed in Factors ``A'' and ``E'' under the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section below, all
of the species included in this final rule could be adversely affected by acts of vandalism. The Service is aware of
vernal pools that contained suitable habitat for these animals that apparently were destroyed to escape regulatory
requirements. Designation of critical habitat at this time would increase the degree of threat facing these species.


Issue 10:

 One commenter stated that there is not enough data on the species listed herein upon which to develop a recovery plan.


Service Response:

 Section 4(f) of the Act directs the Secretary to develop and implement recovery plans for conservation and survival
of listed endangered and threatened species. The Service intends to pursue the development of a recovery plan for
the four species as soon as possible. Identification of needed research and acquisition of additional data are key
components of most recovery plans.


Issue 11:

 Several commenters stated that the California linderiella and the vernal pool fairy shrimp do not warrant listing
because of their widespread distribution.


Service Response:

 Species may be listed under the Act if one or more of the five listing criteria imperils the species with extinction
or if the species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future, throughout all or a significant portion
of its range. These criteria apply for narrowly, as well as widely distributed species. As described elsewhere in
this final rule, the vernal pool fairy shrimp is imperiled by habitat loss from construction activities and degradation
to the extent that 28 of the 32 known populations face one or more of the various threats described elsewhere in this
rule. Thus, even though this species has a relatively wide range in California, it is imperiled by one or more of five
factors throughout a significant portion of its range.

At the time the proposed rule was published, the California linderiella was known from vernal pools in the Central
Valley from central Tehama County to central Madera County and across the valley in the Sacramento area to the central
and south coast mountains from Lake County south to Riverside County. Surveys conducted in 1993 and other information
that has become available to the Service indicate that the range extends from Shasta County south to Fresno County
and across the valley to the Coast and Transverse Ranges from Willits in Mendocino County south to near Sulfur Mountain
in Ventura County. Within this area more vernal pools have been found to contain subpopulations of the California
linderiella than was known at the time of the proposed rule. The populations in Riverside County have been determined
to represent an undescribed species of 

Linderiella. 

The Service has carefully considered the additional information and has determined that the California linderiella
fails to meet the definition of either an endangered or threatened species and has withdrawn it from consideration
for endangered or threatened status.



Issue 12: 

After the comment period closed, six parties requested that the Service extend the date of the final determination
for these species pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6). That section of the Act provides for a six-month extension to solicit
additional data if the Secretary finds that ``there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy
of the available data relevant to the determination.'' The parties asserted that additional information on the range
and status of these animals could become available during this time period. One of these commenters submitted a report
as the basis for their request that summarized museum, literature, and field records, the majority of which were collected
in 1993, for the five species (Sugnet and Associates 1993b). A seventh party, the California Native Plant Society,
stated that they were opposed to the six month extension and they urged the Service to immediately list the five species.



Service Response: 

The report by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) provided a number of records for the California linderiella, vernal pool
fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp that have been incorporated into this final rule. The report listed
3092 ``discrete locations'' that contained 703 records of the California linderiella, 178 records of the vernal
pool fairy shrimp, and 345 records of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.

The report by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) presented only township and range information on the locations of the
California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, and the vernal
pool tadpole shrimp. A request by the California Department of Fish and Game to obtain the precise locations that served
as the basis for the report was unsuccessful (letter from California Department of Fish and Game to Sugnet and Associates,
dated December 29, 1993; letter from Sugnet and Associates to California Department of Fish and Game, dated January
29, 1994). The report also treated the records of the individual vernal pools inhabited by the California linderiella,
vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp as ``discrete locations.'' However, as described in
greater detail in the 

Background 

section, abundance of inhabited vernal pool complexes most appropriately describes the population status of the
five vernal pool crustaceans; animals in individual pools most appropriately are referred to as subpopulations.
Accordingly, the study by Sugnet and Associates (1993b) overestimated the number of populations of the California
linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Statements in Sugnet and Associates (1993b),
such as ``Results of this effort indicate that 

B. lynchi 

occurs at a total of 178 discrete locations * * *'', should be interpreted in light of the fact that a
number of inhabited pools can occur within a single vernal pool complex, and that all of these could be threatened by
a single project proposal. For example, the proposed Sunrise-Douglas development in Sacramento County contains
over 500 vernal pools (Sugnet and Associates 1993a). An unknown number of these pools contain the vernal pool fairy
shrimp, and/or vernal pool tadpole shrimp.

The data in Sugnet and Associates (1993b) and other information available to the Service increased the known ranges
and number of populations from that described in the proposed rule for three of the five species and located additional
populations for one species. The report identified a geographic range extension for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
and increased the number of populations from fourteen to seventeen; none were from unexpected areas or non-vernal
pool habitat. Two additional populations of the Conservancy fairy shrimp were located, one at the Sacramento National
Wildlife Refuge and one in northern Ventura County. The geographic distribution of the vernal pool fairy shrimp was
not increased but additional pools containing this species were located within the known range and known populations
of this animal.

With the exception of the California linderiella, the Service concludes that the report by Sugnet and Associates
(1993b) does not provide a basis for significant disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available
data relevant to this listing action. Rather, the data presented in the report substantiates the rarity and fragmented
distributions of the four species listed herein. Therefore, the Service has determined to issue a final regulation
pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(6)(i)(I).


Issue 13:

 Many commenters, including the California Department of Transportation and Congressman Wally Herger, requested
the Service delay or not list the five species because they believed additional distributional and ecological data
are needed to determine the ``true'' status of these animals. Several people contended that the survey work and collection
data upon which the proposed rule was based are inadequate. One commenter contended that this perceived lack of information
would result in a procedurally inadequate listing. Eight commenters stated that the data utilized by the Service
presents only collection places inhabited by the species. They asserted that the Service did not conduct a random
field survey and failed to accurately delineate the distributions of the species. These parties contended that the
absence of information on locations that are not inhabited by the animals suggests a general lack of extensive collection
efforts or knowledge of them. To support the need for further field work, one commenter cited 18 records of the vernal
pool fairy shrimp and 30 records of the California linderiella that were not included in this proposed rule. This commenter
did not provide any additional records of the Conservancy fairy shrimp, the longhorn fairy shrimp, or the vernal pool
tadpole shrimp.


Service Response:

 Scientifically credible data on the status of the five crustaceans was collected in a random 322 kilometer (200 mile)
north-south transect in the Sacramento Valley from Fall River in Shasta County to Jepson Prairie in Solano County
(Simovich 

et al.

 1992). This study found that distinct segments totaling 35 kilometers (22 miles), or 11 percent of the transect, contain
vernal pools and swales. Within the portions of the transect, the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and the vernal pool fairy
shrimp were found on 16 kilometers (10 miles), the Conservancy fairy shrimp on 6 kilometers (4 miles), and the California
linderiella on 10 kilometers (6 miles). The animals were not found in all pools and swales in suitable habitat areas
in this study (J. King, 

in litt

., 1992). King (

in litt

., 1992) reported that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp was found in only five pools on 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the 16
kilometers (10 miles) of vernal pools where the animal occurred, indicating a sparse distribution within much of
the area where it occurs. The fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp largely were absent from extensive
regions in the Sacramento Valley where degraded vernal pools still remain, such as the Red Bluff and Coyote Creek areas
of Tehama County, and the Allendale area of Solano County (R. Brusca, 

in litt.

, 1992). The three crustacean biologists who conducted this research concluded that based on this random field survey,
these fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are rare throughout their ranges.
A comparison of the maps in Sugnet and Associates (1993b) indicates that the number of occupied pools, and amount of
suitable habitat for the 30 populations of the California linderiella are larger than for the 32 populations of the
vernal pool fairy shrimp. In addition, the California linderiella is known from the north coast, San Francisco Bay
area, western areas in the San Joaquin Valley, and the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada in San Joaquin and Stanislaus
Counties where the vernal pool fairy shrimp is not known to be present (Sugnet and Associates 1993b).
The Service concludes, as detailed in the ``Summary of Factors'' section, that there is sufficient biological evidence
that the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
warrant listing. Sampling conducted at various locations and intensities between 1981 and 1993 by biologists familiar
with the four fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp and their habitat provided adequate information on the
distribution, habitat requirements, and most importantly, threats to the four species to warrant the present action.
All additional data provided by respondents during the comment period, including the report by Sugnet & Associates
(1993b) have been incorporated into this final rule; none of this data indicated that these taxa were not threatened
or endangered. The Service's decision to propose the four fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp was based
on significant threats associated with habitat loss and fragmentation, rather than solely on the basis of population
numbers.

Issue 14: 

Several commenters, including Congressman Wally Herger, requested the precise locations of the populations of
the species be widely disseminated or included in the final rule. One respondent requested that the Service notify
all landowners whose property has been found to contain one or more of the species.


Service Response: 

For the reasons discussed in the response dealing with critical habitat below, the Service concludes that providing
the exact locations would increase the degree of threat facing these species.


Issue 15: 

Some commenters were concerned that the Service did not give due consideration to the impacts of the six year drought
in California. They contended that increased amounts of rainfall would result in greater numbers of the fairy shrimp
and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.


Service Response: 

The average and above average rainfall levels that occurred in 1992/1993 did not reveal significant new populations
of the five species in unexpected areas because most vernal pools held water, at least to some extent, during the drought
that extended from 1987 to 1992. Even very small, shallow vernal pools were observed to hold water, allowing reproduction
of the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp during these drought years (J. King pers. comm. 1992; M. Simovich
pers. comm. 1992; Simovich 

et al. 

1993). Also, natural vernal pool complexes are expected to have some pools that at least partially pond in drought
years even though other pools may fill only during years of average or above average precipitation.


Issue 16: 

Several commenters concluded that the data on the crustaceans does not demonstrate a historic and consistent decline
in populations levels. One commenter stated that the data on the Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp,
and the vernal pool fairy shrimp is very limited because they were only recently described.


Service Response: 

Relatively little information is available to reconstruct the distribution of the four species listed herein prior
to the loss of vernal pool habitat that began in the late 1800's. However, the Service is required to evaluate species
based on current and likely future threats to their status. As discussed in this final rule, numerous populations
of the four species face severe, imminent threats that could result in substantial habitat losses and extirpations
in the future. Since at least the mid-1980's, the human population has been growing rapidly throughout the Central
Valley and other regions of California. Although three of the five crustaceans were described scientifically in
1990, their distribution and abundance are sufficiently documented relative to current and future threats to their
continued existence. Field samples made from vernal pools have contained these three fairy shrimp prior to 1990.
The earliest known collections of the Conservancy fairy shrimp were made in 1979, the vernal pool fairy shrimp in 1965,
and the longhorn fairy shrimp in 1937.


Issue 17:

 The Contra Costa Water District reported that neither the Los Vaqueros Reservoir alternative nor the Kellogg Reservoir
alternative would impact the single vernal pool complex inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp within the watershed
(John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project, 

in litt.

, 1992).


Service Response:

 The Los Vaqueros Reservoir project likely would result in adverse impacts to the California linderiella, vernal
pool fairy shrimp, and the longhorn fairy shrimp based on an analysis of the environmental documents for this project
(California Department of Fish and Game 1983; John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project, 

in litt

., 1992; Jones and Stokes 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991). On September 2, 1993, the Service issued a conference opinion to
the Bureau of Reclamation for the effects of the Los Vaqueros Reservoir project on the three fairy shrimp species.


Issue 18:

 One commenter stated that there are populations of the crustacean species located on nature preserves and for this
reason the Service was urged to ``slow'' the listing process for these animals. Four people noted that portions of
three preserves owned by the Nature Conservancy are inhabited by three of the fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool
tadpole shrimp. One commenter concluded that this assured the long-term protection of these species. However, the
other three commenters stated that the preserves were either not specifically managed for these animals or the sites
are imperiled by activities on adjacent properties.

Service Response: 

The Service recognizes that while some populations of the fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp are found on
protected public and private lands, almost all are located in areas that are not secure against adverse impacts to
these animals. Please refer to Factor D below, for an expanded discussion on landownership patterns and protection
for these species.


Issue 19: 

One commenter said the scientific articles containing data on the fairy shrimp that were used by the Service are ``primitive
and unreliable'' and the taxonomy of these crustaceans is ``confused''. However, four recognized crustacean biologists
noted that the taxonomy of fairy shrimp found in California had been reviewed recently in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal and the taxonomic status of these species is widely accepted by current authorities.


Service Response: 

Using the best and most recent systematic information from a number of reliable sources, including Eng 

et al. 

(1990), D. Belk (pers. comm., 192), and M. Fugate (pers. comm., 1992), the Service maintains that the Conservancy
fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the longhorn fairy shrimp are valid species and no further taxonomic studies
are needed.


Issue 20: 

Several respondents, including Congressman Wally Herger contended that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a ``taxonomically
unstable species''. One commenter stated that taxonomic confusion between Lemmon's tadpole shrimp (

Lepidurus lemmoni

) and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp should be resolved prior to any listing decision. Several commenters stated that
the taxonomy of tadpole shrimps is unresolved and recommended that the Service not list the animal. Expressing a contrary
position, three recognized authorities on crustaceans provided information showing the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
is a biologically and taxonomically valid species. They reported that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is distinct
in both morphology and ecology from Lemmon's tadpole shrimp, which is restricted to alkaline lakes is western North
America.


Service Response: 

Using the best and most recent systematic information from a number of reliable sources, including Lynch (1972) and
various crustacean biologists) (R. Brusca, 

in litt., 

1992; M. Simovich, 

in litt., 

1992; J. King, 

in litt,. 

1992), the Service maintains that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a valid species and no further taxonomic studies
are needed.


Issue 21: 

Four respondents expressed concern that the Service was going to list the ricefield tadpole shrimp (

Triops longicaudatus

) a pest in rice fields in the Central Valley. They further stated that protection of this animal would be an ``economic
disaster'' for rice growers of California. Alternatively, three recognized crustacean authorities provided information
showing that the rice field tadpole shrimp is only distantly related to the vernal pool tadpool shrimp. They stated
that 

T. longicaudatus 

is known to occur in the Central Valley only in rice fields while 

L. packardi 

is found only in vernal pools. One of the crustacean biologists stated that based on genetic studies, the two species
are separated by genetic distances on the order of those normally found between crustacean orders (J. King, 

in litt., 

1992). In addition, the four crustacean biologists noted that the two species are morphologically distinct and are
easily distinguishable from each other.


Service Response: 

The findings in this final rule reflect the published taxonomic literature and the expert opinion of recognized crustacean
biologists.


Issue 22: 

A number of commenters stated that Federal, State, and local regulatory processes provide adequate protection for
the crustaceans. Two respondents said that listing would directly affect agriculture, industrial, and commercial
development in areas that have been meticulously planned and subject to State laws such as the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) and California Subdivision Map Act. Some commenters noted the wetlands ``no-net-loss'' policies
of several State and county agencies, while other cited section 404 of the Clean Water Act. On commenter analyzed data
for a group of 29 development projects in the Sacramento area and found that 56 percent of the vernal pools at these project
sites had been preserved and 0.9 hectare (2.2 acres) of vernal pools provided as mitigation for each acre impacted
under Corps permit conditions pursuant to section 404 requirements. The commenter stated that this group of projects
is representative of the level of preservation afforded vernal pool habitat in the Sacramento area and further concluded
that this level of protection may be equaled or exceeded for projects requiring section 404 permits throughout the
range of the five species. Another commenter noted that the Corps recently classified vernal pools at a proposed project
site in Sacramento County as ``aquatic resources of national importance''. According to the commenter, this designation
will cause the Corps to more closely evaluate impacts to vernal pools from proposed projects and thus provide significant
protection to vernal pool habitat for the five crustacean species during a six-month time extension.
Expressing a contrary position, several other commenters noted that Federal, State, and local laws have been ineffective
in providing protection for these species. The Mount Lassen Chapter of the California Native Plant Society provided
data on the destruction of two vernal pool complexes known to have been inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
in the City of Chico. They provided information on two other vernal pool complexes in Chico that are located on properties
proposed for residential development. Another commenter stated that vernal pools in Santa Rosa have been eliminated
despite the protective provisions of State law (CEQA). A number of respondents noted that destruction of vernal pools
commonly is allowed if an attempt is made to create artificial habitat as compensation.


Service Response: 

While vernal pool habitat has been preserved permanently under special conditions of section 404 permits for a number
of projects, significant areas of vernal pool habitat continue to be lost in spite of the Corps jurisdictional authority
to regulate these wetlands under the Clean Water Act. Since 1987, the Service has been tracking the Corps' implementation
of Nationwide Permit 26 within the area of responsibility of the Service's Sacramento Field Office. A Service report
produced in October 1992 showed that the Corps' Sacramento District authorized filling of 189 hectares (467 acres)
of wetlands between 1987 and 1992 pursuant to Nationwide Permit 26 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992). During this
same time period, the Corps' San Francisco District authorized projects under Nationwide Permit 26 that filled a
total of 104 hectares (257 acres) of wetlands of which 15.6 hectares (38.6 acres) were in the Santa Rosa Plain. The report
notes that these figures are conservative estimates because notification of agencies for projects affecting less
than 0.405 hectares (1.0 acre) are not mandatory. The Service estimates that a majority of the wetland losses permitted
in the Sacramento District constitute vernal pools. In addition, between December 1, 1992, and June 15, 1993, the
Service identified 10 unauthorized projects in Sacramento and Butte Counties that destroyed or damaged between
8.5 and 15 hectares (21 and 37 acres) of vernal pool habitat (D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). The projects were not authorized
because landowners either were not required or failed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the section 404
permitting process. In addition, gravel mines are proposed for significant areas in the Sacramento Valley, including
an approximately 404 hectare (1,000 acres) site south of Mather Air Force Base that contains the California linderiella,
vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Under recent changes in the Corps of Engineers regulations,
some gravel mining activities will be regulated. However, in the past, most of these activities were not subject to
the provisions of the Clean Water Act.

In December 1992, the Department of the Interior signed a revised Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of the
Army that provides an administrative process for requesting higher level review of District Engineers' decisions
on section 404 individual permit applications. One criterion necessary for higher level review under the Memorandum
of Agreement is that the wetlands in question must constitute ``aquatic resources of national importance.'' The
ultimate determination on whether the criterion is met will be made on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Secretary
of the Army (Civil Works). Requests for higher level review only apply to projects subject to individual permits,
not Nationwide permits. Projects determined by the Corp's Sacramento District to quality for authorization under
Nationwide Permit 26 are not eligible for higher level review. Department of the Army concurrence with the designation
of vernal pools at the project site at issue ``as aquatic resources of national importance'' does not ensure application
of additional protection to vernal pools beyond that site (see discussion under Issue 29 and Factor D, ``Summary of
Factors Affecting the Species'', for a complete discussion on the adequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms for
the four species listed herein). Such a designation must be made on a site-specific basis and, by itself, does not necessarily
effect any protection of these resources. San Francisco District of the Corps considered possible revocation of
Nationwide Permit 26 in the Santa Rosa Plain that would have ensured that all projects affecting wetlands in this area
would require authorization on an individual permit basis and potential higher level review. However, the Corps
decided instead to impose stricter conditions on the use of Nationwide Permit 26 in this area, including demonstration
that no rare or endangered plant or animal species are supported on the wetlands within any proposed project site.
The Corps also determined that individual permits would be required on wetlands that support federally proposed
or listed threatened or endangered species. Regardless, of the four species listed herein, only the California linderiella
is found at the Santa Rosa Plain and this area constitutes a small percentage of the overall geographical range of the
species. Therefore, any additional protection afforded vernal pools in this area would not provide rangewide protection
of these animals.

Based on this and other information discussed under Factor D below, the Service concludes that proposed and on-going
damage or destruction of vernal pools in California caused by urban and agricultural development is prevalent despite
existing Federal, State, and local regulations and that existing levels of protection are not adequate to assure
the survival of these species.



Issue 23: 

One commenter completed a literature survey of three reports that addressed trends in overall wetland losses throughout
California and the Central Valley, in particular. Essentially, this commenter concluded that the historic trend
of wetland losses throughout California subsided in the mid-1980's and that current wetland acreages actually are
increasing in the State, apparently as a result of the implementation of Federal wetland regulatory mechanisms.

Service Response: 

Methodological flaws and ambiguities in the analysis conducted by this commenter invalidate the report's findings.
The most serious flaw is the comparison of wetland acreages in various studies that focused on different geographic
study areas. For example, the two Service reports reviewed by the commenter cannot be used together to draw conclusions
on changes in wetland acreages because data from the Central Valley and the entire State are not comparable.


Issue 24: 

Several commenters disputed the Service's statement in the proposed rule that 90 percent of the original vernal pool
habitat throughout the Central Valley has been lost and that an estimated 2 to 3 percent of vernal pool habitat continues
to be lost annually. Several commenters contended that the study referenced by the Service actually showed a 67 to
88 percent historic loss of vernal pool acreage. One commenter further stated that additional interpretation and
analysis of the data used in the study revealed that historic losses were 63 percent. Based upon information contained
in a separate document prepared by the Service, other commenters asserted that the actual loss more closely approximated
50 percent. After the comment period closed, one respondent commented that preliminary results from a newly-initiated
soils data analysis indicate that the original estimates of historic vernal pool losses in the Central Valley may
be substantially less than was identified in the proposed rule. Another late commenter noted that U.S. Soil Conservation
Service information supported recent conclusions drawn by other soil scientists that 404,700 hectares (1 million
acres) of soils suitable for vernal pool habitat remain from 809,400 hectares (2 million acres) determined to have
historically existed in the Central Valley, thus implying that historic losses were close to 50 percent.


Service Response: 

After closer review of the referenced study (Holland 1978), the Service discovered apparent arithmetic errors in
the estimates of historic vernal pool habitat (i.e., areas that could have supported pools) losses. Correction of
these errors yields estimates of vernal pool habitat losses between 60 and 85 percent. Accordingly, the Service finds
that the study's corrected estimates of historic vernal pool habitat loss in the Central Valley are reasonably close
to the range of estimates determined by those commenters who criticized the study. Comments concerning a 50 percent
habitat reduction based upon a Service publication appear to be derived from the Wetlands of the California Central
Valley; Status and Trends 1939 to mid-1980's (Frayer 

et al. 

1989), which estimated losses of palustrine emergent wetlands. However, calculation of vernal pool losses cannot
be deduced from the numerous wetland types categorized as ``palustrine emergent wetlands.'' The results of the soils
data analysis under preparation by the commenter were not available for review at the time of publication of this final
rule.
The purpose of addressing historic vernal pool losses in the proposed rule was to provide a historical context to the
Central Valley ecosystem inhabited by the four crustacean species. It was not the intention, nor is it appropriate,
to conduct an exhaustive analysis of information pertaining to the history of vernal pool habitat losses affecting
the five crustacean species. Unverifiable and/or contradictory information on the extent of former and current
vernal pool habitat will generate continued debate on this issue throughout the foreseeable future. In a legal context,
the extent of historic habitat loss is of academic interest only, since the five factors at 50 CFR 424.11(c) under which
species may qualify for listing look prospectively to the future rather than retrospectively on the past. The relevant
issues are whether the current extent of fairy and tadpole shrimp habitat is depleted and/or fragmented enough to
render the species vulnerable to extinction, or whether foreseeable threats similarly threaten the species.


Issue 25: 

Eight commenters, including four mosquito abatement districts, reported that vernal pools provided an important
breeding source for mosquitoes. They stated that the listing of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp,
when coupled with the preservation and creation of vernal pools next to residential areas, will create a serious health
risk to people. They were especially concerned about the western encephalitis mosquito (

Culex tarsalis

), a vector of western equine encephalitis and Saint Louis encephalitis. Some of the respondents also expressed concern
about mosquito-borne malaria and yellow fever. A number of commenters stated that continued urban development would
result in greater numbers of people being affected by mosquitoes and increase the need to control mosquitoes in vernal
pools. The four mosquito abatement districts were concerned that listing of the crustaceans would increase the costs
and restrictions on their control activities.
Expressing a contrary position, four biologists stated that mosquitoes rarely are found in vernal pools and swales
that have not been impacted by humans. They reported this is likely due to the presence of the high abundance of predatory
crustaceans and aquatic insects that inhabit this ecosystem. A crustacean specialist noted that mosquitoes were
absent or not present in significant numbers in pools inhabited by the fairy shrimp and the tadpole shrimp. Significant
numbers of mosquito larvae were found in areas that contain created vernal pools or artificial bodies of water e.g.,
ditches and stock ponds where the crustaceans are sparse or absent. One biologist reported that no mosquito larvae
were found in any of the 27 randomly sampled vernal pools at Beale Air Force Base (Mary Ann Griggs, private biologist,
Colusa, California, 

in litt., 

1992). However, mosquitos were found in areas that had augmented water supply from a pressure release valve on a well.
The water supply produced a distinctively different flora and fauna than nearby vernal pools. Commenting biologists
stated that the use of oil and mosquito fish (

Gambusia affinis

) will adversely affect vernal pool fauna, including the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, consequently
allowing mosquitoes populations to sue vernal pools where they otherwise are controlled or eradicated by the nature
pool fauna.

Service Response:

 The best information available to the Service indicates that non-degraded vernal pools and swales do not provide
a significant breeding source for mosquitoes. Mosquitoes do not appear in vernal pools until very late in the season,
when they are unlikely to complete their development before the pools dry (Wright 1991; Stan Wright and Dave Brown,
Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito Abatement District, pers. comm., 1993). This pattern likely is due to the ecology of vernal
pool invertebrate communities rather than to oviposition timing of female mosquitoes or to water chemistry, since
(1) duck ponds in the same area that fill at the same time as many vernal pools produce mosquitoes throughout the wet
season while vernal pools do not, and (2) degraded pools and ruts without healthy vernal pool invertebrate communities
support mosquito populations while undisturbed vernal pools in close proximity do not (S. Wright, pers. comm., 1993;
J. King, pers. comm., 1993; Christopher Rogers, Redding Mosquito Abatement District, pers. comm., 1993).

Female mosquitoes are attracted to gases produced by fermentation that indicate an abundance of decaying organic
matter suitable for food for mosquito larvae (S. Wright, pers. comm., 1993). This likely is the cue used by females
to select oviposition sites. Healthy vernal pools appear to have tight nutrient cycling and relatively low levels
of decaying organic material, which makes them undesirable as oviposition sites for gravid mosquitoes. Only late
in the season when the abundance of the invertebrates in vernal pools begins to decline are enough nutrients and organic
material available to make the vernal pools attractive oviposition sites. By this time, however, it is often too late
for the mosquito larvae to develop before the pools dry. Therefore, protecting vernal pools from disturbance and
degradation can prevent vernal pools from becoming mosquito breeding grounds, thereby naturally preempting the
need for artificial mosquito control in this habitat.

Quantitative data collected from 64 vernal pools of widely varying types, depths, and locations on a random 322 kilometer
(200 mile) north-south transect in the Central Valley from Fall River in Shasta County to Jepson Prairie in Solano
County over an entire season indicate that mosquitoes are successful in breeding and developing only in pools that
have been disturbed or degraded, or late in the season (J. King, pers. comm., 1993). Only about one third (34 percent)
of the 64 pools studied were occupied by mosquito larvae or pupae. Most of these pools had relatively low population
densities of mosquitoes, and in all of these pools mosquitoes were only present later in the season. Of the 5 pools (8
percent) that did contain abundant mosquitoes, one was an artificially created pool and another appeared to be degraded
by vehicular use and possibly discing.

The Service recognizes that there could be potential conflicts with protection of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal
pool tadpole shrimp in implementing mosquito control programs. The Service will be working with Federal, State,
and local agencies, and examining additional alternatives, such as the use of 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 var. 

israelensis

 (Bti) and methoprene, to allow suppression programs to continue. In this way, the Service is confident that Federal
listing will contribute to the survival of the four species and promote the understanding of their vernal pool environment
without jeopardizing public health and safety.



Issue 26:

 Several commenters expressed concern that listing of the crustaceans would curtail or eliminate cattle and livestock
grazing in areas containing vernal pools. Two crustacean biologists reported that grazing by cattle and the crustacean
species are compatible with each other. They stated that moderate to low levels of grazing likely have no adverse impacts
on the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.



Service Response:

 The Service recognizes and acknowledges that low to moderate levels of livestock grazing likely have no impact or
may be beneficial for these crustaceans. However, overgrazing in areas containing the shrimp and their habitat likely
is detrimental to these species. High levels of pasture runoff may lead to increased siltation of vernal pool habitat,
and high livestock densities may cause changes in pool water chemistry, water quality, and excessive physical disturbances,
such as trampling.



Issue 27:

 Several commenters reported the presence of the fairy shrimp in non-vernal pool habitats, such as irrigation return
ditches, stock ponds, a backhoe pit, a gravel pit, and a depression left from scraping. One commenter stated that a
historic vernal pool habitat site in southern Sacramento County that was disced, plowed, and farmed with winter wheat
still contained inundated depressions inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp.
This example was used to support the contention that these species can survive and reproduce in degraded habitat.
The commenter also noted that ``the site was not leveled unlike other properties in the area, and still retained some
swale and hillock topography.'' (Bill Sugnet, Sugnet and Associates, 

in litt.

, 1992). Another respondent, based on anecdotal data, concluded that the habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp,
and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp has been insufficiently described. He reported them from roadside ditches, scrapes,
tire track depressions, or similar man-made ephemeral pools from 28 locations in Sacramento County (E.J. Koford,
Ebasco Environmental, 

in litt.

, 1992). This commenter asserted that herbicides and/or mechanical weed control at sites located along some railroad
tracks may have promoted the habitat for these species. One crustacean biologist, based on discussions, examination
of photographs of these sites, and personal knowledge of the area concluded that they are remnant or disturbed vernal
pools (J. King pers. comm., 1992).

Service Response: 

The Service has reviewed carefully the assertion that the crustaceans are found in non-vernal pool habitat. A number
of the sites that served as the basis for this belief have been examined by Service biologists and were found to represent
degraded vernal pool habitat or, in one case, an ephemeral wetland located in a gravel pit that likely was colonized
by fairy shrimp washed in from adjacent vernal pools during periods of high rainfall. Based on the best information
available, the Service believes that a significant portion of these records most likely represent ``unusual'' vernal
pools (e.g., rock depression pools) or vernal pool habitat that was incorrectly identified. Some of these records,
such as roadside ditches, scraped areas, and airport runoff ditches almost certainly represent remnant vernal pool
habitat or are part of the swale systems connected to vernal pools. Lack of experience or familiarity with vernal pool
ecosystems likely has led some respondents to misinterpret these observations. Most of these disturbed habitats
also are imperiled by urban development, gravel mining, and, in the cases of roadside ditches, grading and spraying
of herbicides for highway maintenance. In addition, the accurate identification of fairy shrimp is extremely difficult
because the morphological characters required to differentiate the various species are often extremely subtle
and can be misinterpreted by biologists not specifically trained in fairy shrimp identification. Widespread, common
species, such as Lindahl's fairy shrimp, can be mistaken for other fairy shrimp species. Some of the records of the
California linderiella and vernal pool fairy shrimp in non-vernal pool habitats may result from such misidentifications.



The potential for a fairy shrimp population to persist after habitat disturbance varies from case to case, depending
upon specific circumstances, such as the nature and intensity of disturbance, how much of the original egg bank was
destroyed, and other factors. With the exception of a few extremely rare cases, plowed fields that historically held
vernal pool habitat do not support populations of these species. The example provided by the commenter is not typical
of agricultural operations, as is pointed out in the commenter's statement that this site was ``unlike other properties
in the


area . . .'' (B. Sugnet, 

in litt.

, 1992), with respect to the degree of disturbance (i.e., leveling) and adverse modification of the vernal pool habitat.






Issue 28: 

Many respondents contended that the proposed rule did not reflect accurately the success of vernal pool ``creation''
efforts. For example, a number of commenters claimed that artificial vernal pools, primarily in Sacramento and Placer
Counties, cited in Sugnet and Associates (1992), were successful and were adequate mitigation for adverse impacts
to vernal pools resulting from urban development. Other commenters asserted that ongoing creation ratios of 2:1
or greater and the ability to transplant these animals makes it likely that the habitat for these species will increase
over time. 

One commenter stated that the ability to successfully transplant the eggs of fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp is well
known. One submitted report (Sugnet and Associates 1992) asserted that the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole
shrimp have been shown in the ``literature and in field sampling to be extremely hardy and capable of surviving long-term
in greatly disturbed conditions and artificial habitats''. The report also stated that there are technical papers
that demonstrate the ability to rear shrimp in the laboratory. The party submitting this report stated that they have
been creating vernal pools as mitigation for development projects and monitoring the fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp
for the past three years from 1989 to 1992. They stated that although the presence of adult fairy shrimp may be due to
a certain number of eggs continuing to hatch from the initial inoculum in successive years due to differences in physiochemical
parameters, the presence of mating individuals and gravid female fairy shrimp in artificial pools, as well as historically
degraded habitat, leads them to conclude that natural reproductive mechanisms are still at work. The report stated
that the California linderiella and the vernal pool fairy shrimp can be transplanted successfully from one vernal
pool location to another. The supporting data and criteria by which success was determined were not specified in the
report. Based partly on the above information, numerous commenters stated that the fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole
shrimp were not imperiled.

On the other hand, one crustacean biologist stated that the reports of successful vernal pool creation have been ``generally
poorly controlled, completely lacking in long-term monitoring, and do not appear in the peer reviewed scientific


literature * * *'' (J. King, 

in litt

., 1992). In addition, this commenter reported that ``contrary to common misconception these organisms [vernal
pool tadpole shrimp] are not easily raised outside of their natural habitat.'' This crustacean specialist stated
that their efforts to maintain viable reproductive vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the laboratory have been unsuccessful.
Another biologist pointed out that long-term studies of the effect of mixing genotypes in created pools likely are
adversely impacting the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (M. Simovich, 

in litt

., 1992).


Eight biologists specializing in crustaceans or plants inhabiting vernal pools stated that these habitats are an
intricate ecosystem and efforts to recreate them likely will not be successful until they are more fully understood.
Furthermore, six fairy shrimp specialists concluded that protection of these animals is best assured via the preservation
of extant habitat and its associated community.


Service Response:

 In a review of 21 vernal pool creation projects dispersed throughout California, Ferren and Gervitz (1990) concluded
that no conclusive data exist to substantiate the hypothesis ``that vernal pools can be restored or created to provide
functional values within the range of variability of natural pools.'' Though some individuals (Sugnet and Associates


et al

. 1992) have claimed complete or some degree of success, these conclusions generally are based on anecdotal unscientific
studies and the persistence of fairy shrimp after only a short period of time, e.g., three years or less. Moreover,
the principal pool creation technique (i.e., relocation of soil from excavated pool bottoms versus inoculation
of a known quantity of eggs) and lack of scientifically designed monitoring do not allow for collection of the necessary
data to determine the long-term population viability of transplanted species.
In a study on the preservation and management of vernal pools (Jones and Stokes Associates 1990), the researchers
concluded that the ``science of vernal pool creation is still in its infancy and is primarily an experimental mitigation
technique.'' Environmental requirements, not dispersal, is likely the limiting factor in the distribution of the
fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (D. Belk, pers. comm., 1992). The four species in this final rule require
unknown, but more restrictive environmental conditions than more widely distributed taxa (J. King, 

in litt

., 1992; M. Simovich, 

in litt

., 1992; R. Brusca, pers. comm., 1992). There are no demonstrated proven long-term populations of the fairy shrimp
or the vernal pool tadpole shrimp in artificial habitats.
Artifically created habitats also may increase the threat of hybridization between the four fairy shrimp and other
more widespread species. For example, Lindahl's fairy shrimp is a widespread species found in western North America
that inhabits a wide array of conditions, ranging from pools whose salinity is high enough to support brine shrimp
(

Artemia

 sp.) to snow melt pools. Poorly planned, careless construction, or haphazard placement of the substrate during vernal
pool creation may enhance conditions for species like Lindahl's fairy shrimp. Laboratory studies have shown that
Lindahl's fairy shrimp and the vernal pool fairy shrimp readily hybridize in the laboratory and produce viable first
generation hybrids (Fugate, pers. comm., 1992). There is evidence that hybridization between other fairy shrimp
has occurred in the field because of human actions. Belk (1977) reported that the westward dispersal from Texas and
New Mexico of a desert fairy shrimp (

Streptocephalus dorothae

) across extensive expanses of arid land into Arizona may be due to the cattle ponds and livestock watering holes that
were built after the 1800's in the region. Wiman (1979) reported that viable hybrid offspring are produced by this
species and Mackin's desert fairy shrimp (

Streptocephalus mackini

), a resident species in Arizona.
Given these uncertainties associated with vernal pool creation, the Service maintains that transplanting target
species (e.g., listed, proposed, and candidate species) into artificial pools cannot be considered adequate replacement
for the loss of occupied vernal pool habitat. Even if such transplantation of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp and creation of their habitat were documented to be a proven procedure rather than an evolving problematic
venture, artificial pool creation for the species listed herein would not fulfill the mandates of section 2 of the
Act, which require the Service to develop programs that conserve the ecosystems upon which listed species depend.
As discussed elsewhere herein, natural habitats throughout the ranges of the four species have been damaged or eliminated.
As a result, the Service concludes that the continued survival and recovery of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal
pool tadpole shrimp only can be assured, at this time, by the preservation of extant vernal pools and their associated
watersheds.


Issue 29:

 Several comments were received questioning the relationship between the Endangered Species Act and the Fifth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution (e.g., ``taking'' without just compensation).


Service Response:

 The mere promulgation of a regulation, such as the enactment of a statute, is rarely sufficient to establish that private
property has been taken unless the regulation on its face denies the property owner the economically viable use of
his property. Listing pursuant to the Endangered Species Act does not automatically restrict all uses of one's land.
A property owner cannot establish that his property has been taken as a result of a regulatory action such as the listing
of a species until he has first submitted a proposal to develop the property and has received a determination as to the
level of development that will be allowed. The property owner must apply for all available permits and waivers before
a taking could potentially be established. With respect to listing, this means that no takings can be established
until the property owner complies with section 10(a) of the Act and the Service concludes that no permit to take incidental
to an otherwise lawful activity will be issued.

Issue 30: 

The Service received a comment that requested an explanation of the applicability of 

Hoffman Homes Inc. 

v. 

EPA 

to vernal pools.


Service Response: Hoffman Homes Inc. 

v. 

EPA, 

916 F.2d 1310 (7th Cir. 1992) held that an isolated wetland, with no shown effect on interstate commerce, was not within
EPA's nor the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction to regulate. That decision was vacated in the same year (

Hoffman Homes Inc. 

v. 

EPA, 

975 F.2d 1554) and the issue reheard by the same court in 1993 (

Hoffman Homes Inc. 

v. 

EPA, 

999 F.2d 256). In its final interpretation of the issues presented in that case, the court held that waters whose use,
degradation, or destruction 

could 

affect interstate commerce, were waters appropriately regulated by EPA and/or the Corps (emphasis added). Based
upon the facts as presented in that case, however, the court could not find sufficient evidence to support a conclusion
that the wetland in question could potentially affect interstate commerce. As such, the court determined this particular
water body to be outside the realm of EPA or Corps jurisdiction.
The Service is not aware how the EPA or Corps view this case relative to vernal pools. Regardless of the interpretation,
however, it is the animal (as opposed to habitat) for which the Endangered Species Act will afford protection with
this final regulation. Should it be determined that neither the Corps nor EPA have jurisdiction over these wetlands,
and that section 7 is not therefore applicable, then the property owner may comply with the Endangered Species Act
through section 10 of the Act.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species



After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Conservancy
fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta conservatio 

Eng 

et al

.), longhorn fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta longiantenna 

Eng 

et al

.), and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (

Lepidurus packardi 

Simon) should be classified as endangered species; and the vernal pool fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta lynchi

 Eng 

et al

.) should be classified as a threatened species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act
(16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1).
These factors and their application to the Conservancy fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta conservatio

), longhorn fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta longiantenna

), vernal pool fairy shrimp (

Branchinecta lynchi

), and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (

Lepidurus packardi

) are as follows:

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range. 

All three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are restricted to vernal pools in California. The habitat
of these animals is imperiled by a variety of human-caused activities, primarily urban development, water supply/flood
control activities, and conversion of land to agricultural use. Habitat loss occurs from direct destruction and
modification of pools due to filling, grading, discing, leveling, and other activities, as well as modification
of surrounding uplands that alters vernal pool watersheds.

Rapid urbanization of areas containing vernal pools poses a significant threat to the four species included in this
final rule. In the Central Valley, at least five pool complexes that were known to contain suitable habitat for the
vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp were eliminated by urban development in the late 1980's.
Mitigation measures were either lacking or unsuccessful. In general, the growth rate of human populations and associated
urban development throughout the Central Valley is equal to or exceeds that of any other region in California. Indicative
of this growth rate are proposals to develop several new towns within the ranges of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and
the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. As an example, two towns proposed in Placer and San Joaquin Counties would support
80,000 and 44,000 people, respectively, and likely would impact significant amounts of vernal pool habitat for these
species (Laver 1991, Wiegand 1991).

Vernal pools in the Redding area that likely provided habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp have been impacted significantly by urban development and agricultural conversion. Aerial photographs
of an approximately 61-hectare (150 acre) area near the Redding Municipal Airport document that development occurring
between 1952 and 1992 resulted in the loss of 62 percent and the degradation of 37 percent of the original vernal pools
in this vernal pool complex (Jim Nelson, California Fish & Game, pers. com., 1993). The remaining pools at this
site are inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Vernal pool areas around the
airport have been zoned for enterprise, and sewer lines have been installed in anticipation of development. Several
proposed residential development projects in the Redding area (e.g., Argyle West and Eagle Crest projects) also
would adversely affect the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. A proposed electrical transmission
line also threatens several pools in the area. Eucalyptus farms have been established on many historic vernal pool
sites around Redding and future groves are planted at the rate of approximately 810 hectares (2,000 acres) per year
(J. Nelson, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 1993).

In the Chico area, certain areas inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp recently were ditched and drained (Patrick
Kelly, Mount Lassen Chapter of the California Native Plant Society, 

in litt

., 1992). In addition, at least four residential developments proposed in Chico, including the Simmons Ranch, Foothill
Park, Sierra Technology, and Bidwell Ranch projects are proposed that would eliminate approximately 810 hectares
(2,000 acres) of habitat containing vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. No specific mitigation
measures are included in these projects for this animal.

Numerous residential and commercial development projects in the Sacramento area pose a severe threat to vernal pool
complexes inhabited by populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp. These proposed
and ongoing projects, sponsored by Federal, State and local agencies, private interests, and local governments,
include, but are not limited to the closure of Mather Air Force Base, modifications to Strawberry, Elk Grove, and Laguna
Creeks, two proposed surface gravel mines, and numerous residential developments including the Elliot Ranch South,
Churchill Downs, Elk Ridge Estates, and Sunrise-Douglas projects.

Urban development and agricultural conversion imperil populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool
tadpole shrimp in the San Joaquin Valley. Castle Air Force Base is undergoing closure and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons
has proposed to build a prison on vernal pools at this site known to contain the two fairy shrimp. The Corps has proposed
the Merced County Streams project that would facilitate urban development in many areas that provide suitable habitat
for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Numerous projects between Stockton and Bakersfield
also would adversely impact the three species, including the Mueller Ranch gravel mine in Stanislaus County, a number
of residential developments in San Joaquin County (e.g., the Liberty project would affect approximately 2,000 vernal
pools), the Yosemite Lake project in Merced County, and the Ball Ranch project in Fresno County.

Areas in the San Francisco Bay area that contain vernal pools also are undergoing substantial urban development.
Vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp in the Livermore area of Alameda County have been adversely
impacted by urban development, agriculture, and alteration of the hydrology of Altamont Creek (Alan Launer, Stanford
University Center for Conservation Biology, 

in litt

., 1992). The City of Livermore is evaluating land use options that could result in the conversion of 3,002 hectares
(7,420 acres) of natural habitat, including vernal pools that provide suitable habitat for the vernal pool fairy
shrimp, to urban use for up to 30,000 people (City of Livermore 1992; Susan Frost, Livermore Planning Department,
pers. comm., 1993). The proposed expansion of the municipal airport at Byron Hot Springs in eastern Contra Costa County
will eliminate a number of pools inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp.

Other vernal pools located in San Luis Obispo County, including most of the known populations of the longhorn fairy
shrimp and at least one population of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, are located in subdivided areas with constructed
roads and lots for sale and development (Eng 

et al

. 1990; Dave Chipping, Amateur biologist, 

in litt

., 1992). To date, some of the sites have been cleared and continued habitat loss is ongoing or impending. The Coastal
Branch Phase II (Coastal Aqueduct) of the State Water Project, proposed by the California Department of Water Resources
(Carol Nelson, California Department of Water Resources, 

in litt

., 1993), annually would convey 70,000 acre-feet of water from the Delta region of California to San Luis Obispo and
Santa Barbara Counties. It is unclear if this source of water would allow urban development of the Soda Lake area, however,
the longhorn fairy shrimp and the vernal pool fairy shrimp may be adversely affected by commercial development made
possible by this project.

A 36-hectare (14 acre) vernal pool located at Skunk Hollow in Riverside County containing a population of the vernal
pool fairy shrimp likely will be adversely affected by urban development and possibly agricultural conversion (Art
Davenport, Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1994; Joseph Jolliffe, Riverside County Planning Department,


in litt., 

1992). The Rancho Bella Vista residential project would impact this vernal pool and, along with other major roadways,
also impact the surrounding watershed (Joseph Jolliffe, 

in litt., 

1992). Skunk Hollow also contains a population of the Riverside fairy shrimp (

Streptocephalus woottoni

), an endangered species (58 FR 41384).


Because of rapid urbanization, several highway projects are proposed that may affect the vernal pool fairy shrimp
and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Vernal pools in the Sacramento area inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and
the vernal pool tadpole shrimp would be affected adversely by the proposed widening of State Highway 16 in Sacramento
County. The State of California has proposed to extend State Highway 505 from Vacaville to Collinsville in Solano
County; this project directly and/or indirectly would impact vernal pools inhabited by the Conservancy fairy shrimp
and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (C. Goude, pers. comm., 1993). Vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp may be affected by improvements to Highway 70 near Gridley in Butte County (Chris Collison, California Department
of Transportation, pers. comm., 1993).

Agricultural conversion poses a widespread threat to remaining vernal pools in the Central Valley. Sites containing
fairy shrimp near Pixley in Tulare County and Haystack Mountain in Merced County are pockets of privately owned habitat
remnants threatened by surrounding agricultural operations (Eng 

et al. 

1990). A 148-hectare (365 acres) site with vernal pools adjacent to State Highway 41 north of Fresno in Fresno County
that likely contained the vernal pool fairy shrimp was disced and graded in 1992 (Dames and Moore 1992). Two sites with
vernal pools in the Sacramento Valley recently were plowed or disced and seeded with winter wheat, apparently in preparation
for future urban development (C. Goude, pers. comm., 1993). Almond and fruit orchards in Stanislaus, Madera, and
Fresno Counties continued to be planted in habitat suitable for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp (J. King pers. comm. 1993; K. Geer and J. Browning, U.S.F.W.S., pers. obs. 1994).

Water supply/flood control activities also generally present a degree of disturbance to affected pools that would
preclude survival of any substantial fraction of the populations. The timing, frequency, and length of inundation
of the vernal pool habitat are critical to the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp; any substantial
hydrologic change in these factors adversely affect the four species. Diversion of watershed runoff feeding the
pools can result in premature pool dry-down before the life cycle of these animals is completed. The three species
of fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp also are intolerant of flowing water that washes away the egg bank.
Supplemental water from outside the natural watershed into vernal pools can change the habitat into a marsh-dominated
or a permanent aquatic community that is unsuitable for the four species of vernal pool shrimps. The modification
of vernal pool areas to create artificial reservoirs, such as the Modesto Reservoir and Turlock Lake in Stanislaus
County, have led to the extirpation of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp population that was known to occur in the vernal
pools where these reservoirs now lie (J. King, pers. comm., 1993). Vernal pool watershed areas have been reduced by
conversion of uplands to paved or grass-turf surfaces, by damming of swales caused by road construction, or other
construction activities. Physical barriers, such as roads and canals, unsuitably deepen a vernal pool upstream
of a barrier, and can isolate a fairy shrimp or vernal pool tadpole shrimp population from a portion of its aquatic habitat.
Surface runoff, including non-point runoff, is altered by disturbance from trenching, grading, scraping, off-road
vehicles, intensive livestock grazing, or other activities that change amounts, patterns, and direction of surface
runoff to ephemeral drainages. Presence of summer water also affects the hydrologic pattern. Introduction of water
during the summer disrupts the life cycles of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp by subjecting them
to greater levels of predation by animals requiring more permanent sources of water. Increased water also converts
vernal pools to unsuitable marsh habitat dominated by emergent vegetation (e.g., cattails).

Direct and associated indirect impacts from the proposed Los Vaqueros Project, a water-storage project in the Kellogg
Creek watershed of eastern Contra Costa County, would adversely impact two vernal pool complexes that support the
highest diversity of fairy shrimp in the State (California Department of Fish and Game 1983). The rock pools in this
area are inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the longhorn fairy shrimp (John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project,


in litt., 

1992). Proposed construction of a major roadway, high-pressure natural gas and petroleum pipelines, and 230,000
kV electrical transmission lines at the Los Vaqueros Reservoir site would adversely affect these species (Jones
and Stokes Associates 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991).

Several proposed utility projects have the potential to affect all of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp. For example, the Pacific Gas Transmission Company_Pacific Gas and Electric natural gas pipeline project
extending from the Canadian border along the west side of the Sacramento Valley to Fresno County has adversely impacted
a number of vernal pools containing the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpool
shrimp (Federal Regulatory Energy Commission 1991; Arnold 1990; C. Nagano, pers. obs., 1992 and 1993). The Service
has issued a conference opinion to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on a portion of this project that will
adversely impact the vernal pool fairy shrimp; however, the applicant has indicated the mitigation measures will
not be implemented if the species is not listed (John Cassady, PGT-PG&E Pipeline Expansion Project, 

in litt., 

1993).

Off-road vehicle (ORV) use also imperils fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp inhabiting vernal pools
(Bauder 1986, 1987). ORVs cut deep ruts, compact soil, destroy native vegetation, and alter pool hydrology. Fire
fighting, security patrols, military maneuvers, and recreational activities cumulatively have damaged vernal
pool habitats in many areas (Bauder 1986, 1987). In Solano County, an off-road vehicle park adjacent to the Jepson
Prairie Reserve owned by the Nature Conservancy could adversely impact populations of the Conservancy fairy shrimp
and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. 

Other secondary impacts associated with urbanization include disposal of waste materials into habitat for the four
species included in this final rule (Bauder 1986, 1987). Disposal of concrete, tires, refrigerators, sofas, and
other trash adversely affects these animals by eliminating habitat, disrupting pool hydrology or, in some cases,
through release of toxic substances. Dust and other forms of air or water pollution from commercial development or
agriculture projects also may be deleterious to these animals. 


Filling of vernal pool wetlands without authorization from the Corps also poses a threat to these species (Tricia
Richards, Sacramento County Planning and Community Development Department, 

in litt,

 1991: D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). In Stanislaus County, a site with 61 hectares (150 acres) of vernal pool habitat
that was potentially inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp was converted to irrigated pasture in 1990 (Martha
Naley, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1991). A 112 hectare (275 acre) site containing vernal pool and
swale habitat for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the Jepson Prairie area in Solano County was destroyed by discing
in October 1992 (C. Nagano and J. Knight, pers. obs., 1992).

The Service is aware of 10 actions in the last 2 years in the Sacramento Valley, including agricultural conversion
and urban development, that have resulted in the damage or destruction of as many as 17 hectares (43 acres) of vernal
pools, exclusive of associated watersheds, that likely provided habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal
pool tadpole shrimp (Dan Strait, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pers. comm., 1993). Some of these activities were
undertaken without authority under the Clean Water Act. At least one of these parties likely intended to alter the
elevations of the site to eliminate one or more of the parameters used by the Corps to define a wetland according to their
1987 jurisdictional manual. Other similar deliberate activities that are damaging or destroying vernal pools are
likely occurring throughout the Central Valley (D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). The Service is concerned that unless
a final rule for the four species is issued and effective immediately upon publication, this may result in landowners
knowingly destroying the habitat of these animals. Previously, this has occurred with other endangered species
that inhabit vernal pools in the Santa Rosa area of Sonoma County (C. D. Nagano and J. C. Knight, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, pers. obs., 1992). Because of the immediate threat posed by these on-going activities, the Service finds
that good cause exists for this rule to take effect immediately upon publication in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 Not known to be applicable.

C. 

Disease or predation.

 The three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are a food item in the diet of migratory waterfowl and other
native animals (Krapu 1974; Swanson 

et al.

 1974; J. King, pers. comm., 1992). However, this naturally occurring predation is not considered a threat to the continued
existence of these crustaceans.

Introduction of the bullfrog (

Rana catesbeiana

) to areas inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp appears to increase the threat of predation facing this crustacean.
These amphibians are voracious predators on many species of native and exotic animals. Large numbers of vernal pool
tadpole shrimp were found in stomach content analysis of bullfrogs captured in vernal pools in the Chico area (Marc
Hayes, Oregon State University, pers. comm., 1993; Robert Fisher, University of California, pers. comm., 1993).
Although bullfrogs are unable to establish permanent breeding populations in vernal pools, dispersing immature
males take up residence in these areas during the rainy season (Mark Jennings, U.S. National Biological Survey, pers.
comm. to Peter Sorensen, 1994). A number of bullfrogs were observed at Jepson Prairie during the winter of 1992/1993
(C. Nagano, pers. obs. 1992/93).

Vernal pool tadpole shrimp were found to have been parasitized by flukes (Trematoda) of an undetermined species at
the Vina Plains, Tehama County (Ahl 1991). The gonads of both sexes were greatly reduced in size and their body cavities
were filled with many young flukes (metacercariae). Ahl concluded that parasitic castration was the major limiting
factor affecting reproduction of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp at the Vina Plains. The range and extent of this parasite
is unknown.

There are no known diseases affecting the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp.

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 The primary cause for the decline of these species is loss of habitat from human activities. State and local laws and
regulations have not been passed to protect the four species included in this final rule. Other regulatory mechanisms
necessary for the conservation of vernal pools have proven inadequate and ineffective.

The environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act for projects that result in loss
of habitats that support these animals sometimes requires development and implementation of mitigation plans.
However, the effectiveness of this statute in protecting vernal pool habitat has not been consistent. As documented
above, fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp habitat typically has been eliminated without offsetting mitigation
measures. Most mitigation plans that have been required were designed specifically for vernal pool plants. The artificial
creation of vernal pools as compensatory mitigation has not been proven scientifically to be successful (Ferren
and Gevirtz 1990; Zedler and Black 1988; J. King, 

in litt.

, 1992; M. Simovich, 

in litt.

, 1992; R. Brusca, 

in litt.

, 1992).

Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps regulates the discharge of fill material into waters of the United
States, which include navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other waters. The Clean Eater Act requires
project proponents to obtain a permit from the Corps prior to undertaking many activities (grading, discharge of
soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in fill of wetlands. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit
26 to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands totalling less than 4 hectares (10 acres). Under Nationwide Permit
26, proposals that involve fill of wetlands less than one acre are considered authorized. Where fill would aversely
modify between 0.4 and 4.0 hectares (one and 10 acres) of wetland, the Corps circulates for comment a predischarge
notification to the Service and other interested parties to determine whether or not an individual permit should
be required for fill activity and associated impacts.

Individual Corps permits are required for discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater
than 4 hectares (10 acres) of wetlands. The review process for individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide
permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit
applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require potential avoidance or mitigation
for environmental impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an individual
permit if the Corps believes that resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In practice,
however, the Corps generally does not require an individual permit when a project qualifies for a nationwide permit,
unless a threatened or endangered species or other significant resources would be adversely affected by the proposed
activity. Most vernal pools and swales within the range of these three species of fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole
shrimp encompass less that 4 hectares (10 acres). The discontinuous distribution of these sites has allowed some
landowners to divide large projects into several smaller projects. Wetland acreage on these smaller projects is
usually under 4 hectares (10 acres), and therefore, most projects qualify for Nationwide Permit 26. Discing and other
farming or ranching practices, including overgrazing, can destroy vernal pool habitat without a permit from the
Corps because many of these activities are exempt from regulation under the Clean Water Act. The discontinuous configuration
of the pools and swales further obscures separation of these wetland losses.

The Sacramento District of the Corps has several thousand vernal pools under its jurisdiction (Coe 1988), which includes
most of the geographic range encompassing the four species listed herein. Areas occupied by these animals are undergoing
rapid urbanization and current trends indicate 60 to 70 percent of these pools could be destroyed in the next 10 to 20
years (Coe 1988).

The Conservancy fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are found in vernal pools
within the Vina Plains in Tehama County. They likely are found in the vicinity of ephemeral swales and drainages that
support 

Limnanthes floccosa

 ssp. 

calfornica

 (Butte County meadowfoam). This plant was listed as an endangered species on June 8, 1992 (57 FR 24192). These crustaceans
could be protected indirectly by actions taken to conserve the Butte County meadowfoam. A ``conservation plan''
has been drafted for the City of Chico (Jokerst 1989) that details various actions designed to conserve the plant,
such as creation of a preserve system. However, the draft plan does not address plant populations and vernal pool habitat
outside city limits. Moreover, the City of Chico has yet to adopt the plan. Meanwhile, typical of other vernal pool
areas, the Corps continues to use nationwide permits to authorize numerous residential developments in the Chico
area.

The Conservancy fairy shrimp and the longhorn fairy shrimp each have portions of one population on lands under public
ownership. Portions of four populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp are on lands under public ownership. Portions
of eight populations of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are on lands under public ownership. The Nature Conservancy
owns or controls portions of vernal pool habitat, including Jepson Prairie in Solano County, Vina Plains in Tehama
County, the Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County, and Santa Rosa Plateau area in Riverside County. All three fairy
shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp occur on Conservancy property. Management plans for some Federal,
State, local, and Conservancy properties include provisions to protect vernal pools but none specifically address
these species. Surrounding privately owned vernal pool habitat and watershed are not protected.

Other natural or man-made factors affecting their continued existence.

 The pools and, in some cases, pool complexes supporting the fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
are usually small and unforeseen natural and man-caused catastrophic events threaten the elimination of some sites.
Many of the known populations of the four species are comprised of single or less than five pools (e.g., 3 of 6 Conservancy
fairy shrimp populations, 1 of 3 longhorn fairy shrimp populations, 20 of 34 vernal pool fairy shrimp populations,
1 of the 18 vernal pool tadpole shrimp populations). In many cases, these populations are remnants of larger, multi-pool
populations that originally existed in historic vernal pool complexes. Such populations are important for their
genetic uniqueness, which has been documented for the Conservancy fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp
(Fugate 1993; J. King pers. comm. 1992). However, these important populations are those that have the most tenuous
chances for long-term persistence due to population bottlenecks in conjunction with low gene flow between populations
(J. King pers. comm. 1993). Additionally, some of the areas with the largest populations (i.e., greatest number of
vernal pools remaining in pool complexes) are currently under threat of fragmentation by numerous proposed projects
(e.g., Sacramento and Placer Counties).
