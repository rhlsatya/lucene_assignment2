NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 








Steam Generator Tube Integrity for Operating Nuclear Power Plants 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering amending its regulations regarding steam generator tube surveillance
and maintenance at operating nuclear power plants. The advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) considers
regulatory approaches that would maintain adequate assurance of steam generator tube integrity while allowing
a more appropriate approach to steam generator surveillance and maintenance activities at nuclear power plants.
The NRC is issuing this ANPRM to invite comments, advice, and recommendations from interested parties on the proposed
steam generator rule. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 


Steam generator tube degradation at nuclear power plants continues to be a problem for the nuclear industry. Industry
actions have been effective in controlling many of the forms of degradation experienced in late 1970s and early 1980s;
however, new degradation mechanisms continue to occur. State-of-the-art nondestructive inspection and tube repair
methods have improved significantly in recent years. Changes in types of degradation being experienced and improvements
in inspection and tube repair technology have made the NRC's existing regulatory requirements and guidance out-of-date
and in some cases overly conservative or impractical. In addition, the NRC staff has determined that factors other
than the material tube degradation should be considered when assessing tube integrity. 


The objective of the proposed rule would be to maintain steam generator tube integrity such that there is an extremely
low probability of steam generator tube leakage that could result in core damage or otherwise exceed allowable off-site
doses while allowing a reasonable approach to steam generator surveillance and maintenance activities (i.e., degradation-specific
management). A performance-based rule with quantitative criteria would achieve the desired goals without being
prescriptive in nature. A flexible rule would accommodate changes in operating experience and technology while
giving incentives for the industry to continue to improve the state-of-the art tube inspection and repair methods.
Incorporation of an integrated approach considers the overall factors of safety and risk, including systems and
radiological assessments. 
The NRC staff's rulemaking effort would establish a flexible framework that allows steam generator tube integrity
to be addressed using a degradation-specific management approach. This approach involves establishing and implementing
preventive measures such as inspection, evaluation, and repair criteria that are applicable to distinct steam generator
degradation mechanisms, and default criteria for the remaining forms of steam generator tube degradation where
experience does not enable a degradation-specific approach. The NRC staff's rulemaking effort would also address
issues relevant to containment bypass probability and severe accidents associated with bypass of containment.
The NRC staff would consider application of more realistic analytical assumptions, as well as defense-in-depth
measures that could be implemented to further ensure safety. The proposed rule would acknowledge new degradation
mechanisms and technological advances in inspection techniques to improve characterization of these mechanisms.


Recognizing that the steam generator rule would contain broad criteria while an associated regulatory guide would
contain more detailed guidance, a proposed outline of the NRC staff's perception of the necessary elements of a steam
generator rule follows: 



(a) Applicability 
(b) Definitions 
(c) Requirements 
(1) Licensee Surveillance and Maintenance Program 


(i) Preservice and Inservice Inspection Program 
(ii) Water Chemistry Program 
(iii) Tube Integrity 
(iv) Repair Criteria 
(v) Repair Methods 
(vi) Nondestructive Examination Considerations 
(vii) Normal Operating Primary-to-Secondary Leakage Monitoring/Limits 


(2) Accident Mitigation

(3) Radiological Consequences 
(d) Severe Accident Considerations
(e) Implementation 



Specific Considerations 



Comments, advice and recommendations on a proposed rule reflecting the aforementioned features and any other pertinent
points are invited from all interested persons. Particularly, comments and supporting reasons are requested on
the following questions: 
1. What are appropriate performance based criteria that should be included in the steam generator proposed rule to
address steam generator inspection scope and frequency, nondestructive examination (NDE) equipment capabilities,
NDE data analyst capabilities, performance demonstration and qualification of NDE systems, steam generator water
chemistry requirements, flaw acceptance criteria, and steam generator tube repair methods? 

2. What are the appropriate performance based criteria that should be incorporated into the proposed rule to define
adequate tube integrity (vis-a-vis 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 14)? 

3. What information should be part of the steam generator proposed rule, and what information should be addressed
in a Regulatory Guide? 

4. How should the proposed rule be structured to assure that licensees make use of available operational experience
and data applicable to steam generator integrity, and that licensees can establish and readily update steam generator
programs? 

5. How should the proposed rule address new or replacement steam generators versus degraded steam generators? 

6. Should the Regulatory Guide be prescriptive in terms of the methods to be used to ensure that the proposed rule's
performance criteria are achieved? 

7. Should the proposed rule require licensees to submit their programs to NRC for review and approval before implementation?


8. What requirements should be instituted to provide improved or additional monitoring of primary-to-secondary
leakage as a means to enhance defense-in-depth relative to steam generator tube degradation? 

9. What changes should be made in the NUREG-0800 radiological calculation guidance used to address the safety
significance of steam generator tube leakage and rupture? 

10. What beyond design basis considerations related to steam generator tube integrity should be addressed during
the rulemaking process (e.g., the potential for containment bypass)? 

11. How should tube failure prevention and mitigation measures be balanced in the proposed rule? 

12. What interim measures are appropriate to allow continued operation of a unit in which new degradation modes are
discovered? 

13. Is the proposed rulemaking action considered a necessary or preferred course of action for addressing steam generator
maintenance and surveillance issues, or are there other alternative regulatory mechanisms that are equally effective
for addressing these issues? If alternatives to rulemaking are preferred, describe the preferred alternatives,
including the pros and cons of pursuing the alternative course of action. 

14. How should the steam generator rule or associated Regulatory Guide address the following technical issues: (1)
Calculation of tube leakage following postulated events such as the main steam line break and the potential for this
leakage to exceed the make-up capacity of the refueling water storage tank (supply source for the emergency core cooling
system), (2) application of eddy current parameters such as voltage that are indirect measures of tube structural
or leakage integrity (as compared to more direct measures such as crack depth or crack length), and (3) calculation
of radiologically significant isotope concentrations in released materials (I-131 equivalent) following
postulated events such as the main steam line break with steam generator tube leakage where there is a paucity of data
on fission product iodine release rates. 

The preliminary views expressed in this notice may change in light of comments received. In any case, there will be
an opportunity later for additional public comment in connection with any proposed rule that may be developed by the
NRC.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede AD 93-05-03, which currently requires repetitively inspecting
each fuel inlet float valve in accordance with certain test procedures on Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna) Models
T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, and replacing any valve that does not pass this test. The manufacturer has
developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined
that the improved valves should be installed to reduce the number of repetitive tests currently required by AD 93-05-03.
The proposed action would require installing these fuel inlet float valves of improved design. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve.

a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-06-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 



Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-CE-06-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City,
Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



On March 4, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93-05-03, Amendment 39-8508 (58 FR 13406, March 11, 1993), in order
to require a certain fuel inlet float valve test on Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, and replacement
of any valve that does not pass this test. An accident involving a Model 402C airplane where the fuel inlet valve failed
in the open position prompted that action. 

Since AD 93-05-03 became effective, Cessna has developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design,
and the FAA has determined that installation of these improved valves serves as a basis for reducing the number of repetitive
tests currently required by AD 93-05-03. 

In addition, Cessna has issued Service Bulletin (SB) MEB93-10, dated December 3, 1993, which specifies procedures
for replacing fuel inlet float valves; and (2) accomplishing an installation test. 

After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above
including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that the fuel inlet float valves of improved
design should be incorporated on the referenced airplanes to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure
of a fuel inlet float valve. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Cessna Models T303, 402C,
404, 414A, and 421C airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93-05-03 with
a new AD that would require replacing the fuel inlet float valves with parts of improved design or modifying the existing
part and periodically accomplishing functional tests to assure proper operation. The proposed actions would be
accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna SB MEB93-10, dated
December 3, 1993.

The replacement compliance time is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). Operators
in commuter service can put up to 200 hours TIS in one calendar month while a general aviation operator may not utilize
the airplane 200 hours TIS in one calendar year. The calendar time compliance will allow commuter operators the option
of accomplishing the actions to coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance. 

The FAA estimates that 1,641 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 22 workhours (15 workhours for replacement and 7 workhours for installation) per airplane to accomplish
the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $3,144
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,144,914.
This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed valve
installation. 

Cessna has informed the FAA that enough improved fuel valves have been sold to equip approximately 1,040 of the affected
airplanes. Assuming that these valves are installed on Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, the
proposed cost impact upon U.S. operators would be reduced from $7,144,914 to $2,616,754. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption

1250922-1, and 1250922-2, installed on aircraft. The proposed action would require applying torque
paint between the engine filter adapter assembly, nut, and oil pump housing; inspecting the oil filter and adapter
assembly for oil leakage and proper installation of the adapter retaining nut and fretting of associated threads
(security), and replacing any oil filter and adapter assembly with oil leakage or security problems; and repetitively
inspecting the torque paint for cracks or misalignment, and reinspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly if torque
paint cracks or misalignment is found. Reports of loose or separated engine oil filter adapters on several airplanes
prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of engine oil caused
by loose or separated oil filter adapters, which could result in engine stoppage while in flight and loss of control
of the airplane.

Discussion



The FAA has received 10 reports of loose or separated engine oil filter adapters on in-service airplanes. The affected
adapters are Cessna engine oil filter adapters, part numbers 0450404-1, 0450404-3, 0556004-1,
0556010-1, 1250403-6, 1250922-1, and 1250922-2. Three of the incidents resulted in an airplane
accident, one serious. These engine oil filter adapters are installed on, but not limited to the following:

(1) The following Cessna model and series airplanes with an affected adapter installed at manufacture: 






(2) Airplanes that have an affected full flow engine oil adapter installed by field approval, including, but not limited
to the following model or series airplanes: 






(3) Airplanes equipped with one of the following Teledyne Continental Motors model or model series engines: 






Cessna has issued Service Bulletin (SB) SEB93-1, dated January 29, 1993, which specifies procedures for inspecting
the engine oil filter and adapter assembly. Oil filter and assembly installation procedures and torque values are
included in the applicable Cessna maintenance manual. 

After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above
including the referenced service instructions, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent loss
of engine oil caused by loose or separated oil filter adapters, which could result in engine stoppage while in flight
and loss of control of the airplane. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes utilizing a Cessna
engine oil filter adapter, part number 0450404-1, 0450404-3, 0556004-1, 0556010-1, 1250403-6,
1250922-1, or 1250922-2, of the same type design, the proposed AD would require (1) applying torque paint
between the engine filter adapter assembly, nut, and oil pump housing; (2) inspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly
for oil leakage and proper installation of the adapter retaining nut and fretting of associated threads (security),
and replacing any oil filter and adapter assembly with oil leakage or security problems; and (3) repetitively inspecting
the torque paint for cracks or misalignment, and reinspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly if torque paint
cracks or misalignment is found. 

The FAA estimates that 70,000 airplanes in the U.S. registry incorporate this engine oil filter and assembly and would
be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed
initial inspection and torque paint application, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,850,000. This cost
is based on the assumption that no operator has accomplished the initial inspection, and does not take into account
the cost for repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections each individual
operator would incur. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed
Model 382 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer
wing to determine fastener placement. The proposed AD also would require repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks
in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. This proposal
is prompted by reports of insufficient distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser
and the edge of the riser, which can adversely affect the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing due to
fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser.

Discussion 




The FAA has received reports that certain outer wing assemblies on Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes were manufactured
with insufficient distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the edge of the riser
(between outer wing stations 29.0 and 36.0). Insufficient distance between the fastener and the riser edge adversely
affects the fatigue resistance of the outer wing assembly due to fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser. Such fatigue
cracking, if not corrected, could result in structural failure of the lower surface of the outer wing assembly. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved Hercules Service Bulletin 382-57-74 (82-688), dated January
31, 1994, which describes procedures for an ultrasonic inspection of kingpin riser number 18 on the lower surface
of the outer wing to determine the distance between the center of the outermost fastener on the kingpin riser and the
edge of the riser. In addition, for fasteners positioned outside certain limits described in the service bulletin,
the service bulletin describes repetitive ultrasonic inspections to detect cracks in the kingpin riser, and repair,
if necessary. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require an inspection of a kingpin riser on the lower surface of the outer wing to determine
fastener placement; and repetitive inspections for fatigue cracks in the kingpin riser if the fasteners are positioned
outside certain limits, and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously. The repair would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
a method approved by the FAA. 


There are approximately 20 Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $220 per airplane.



The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 


The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion 



On August 25, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93-17-09, Amendment 39-8680 (58 FR 
54949, October 25, 1993), which is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 
series airplanes and KC-10A (military) airplanes. That AD requires the implementation of a Structural Inspection
Document (SID) program of structural inspections to detect fatigue cracking, and repair or replacement, as necessary,
to ensure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes as they approach the manufacturer's original fatigue design
life goal. AD 93-17-09 requires inspection of the attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer [designated
Principal Structural Element (PSE) 55.10.001/002 in McDonnell 
Douglas Report Number L26-012, ``DC-10 Supplemental Inspection Document,'' which is referenced in
that AD as the appropriate source of service information] under the fleet leader operator sampling criteria. The
fatigue life for these attach bolts is (N

th

) 119,334 flight hours. The sampling period for this PSE started in September 1989, and will end in June 2001. Sampling
inspections are to be accomplished within that interval for airplanes 
in the candidate fleet that have accumulated more than 59,667 total flight hours (N

th

/2). 

The inspection threshold for the SID program was based upon a fatigue analysis conducted by the manufacturer. The
FAA is not aware of any operator having, as yet, accomplished the inspection of these bolts for the purpose of complying
with the requirements of AD 93-17-09. McDonnell Douglas has advised the FAA that the planning data contained
in Volume III of the SID will be revised to indicate that H-11 bolts have been replaced with new Inconel bolts.


Since the issuance of that AD, operators of Model DC-10 series airplanes have recently reported that the attach
bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer had failed on several in-service airplanes. These failures had occurred on
airplanes that had accumulated between 40,000 total flight hours and 67,000 total flight hours. The attach bolts
and associated nuts on these airplanes were made of H-11 material, which is susceptible to failure due to stress
corrosion. The FAA has determined that replacement of the H-11 bolts and associated nuts with Inconel bolts
and associated nuts will eliminate the 
possibility of failure due to stress corrosion. Failure of the attach bolts in the upper vertical stabilizer, if not
corrected, could compromise the structural integrity of the vertical stabilizer. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1, dated March 8, 1991, and 
Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994, of McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Service Bulletin 55-20, which describe procedures
for repetitive ultrasonic inspections at 12-month intervals to detect cracking in H-11 attach bolts of the
upper vertical stabilizer, and replacement of H-11 attach bolts and associated nuts with Inconel attach bolts
and associated nuts. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require ultrasonic inspections at 18-month intervals to detect cracking in H-11
attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer, and replacement of H-11 attach bolts and associated nuts with
Inconel attach bolts and associated nuts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
procedures specified in the service bulletins described previously. 

Although the referenced service bulletins recommend that these inspections be performed at 12-month intervals,
the FAA has determined that 18-month intervals will not adversely affect safety and will allow these repetitive inspections
to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance
personnel will be available.

There are approximately 426 McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes 
and KC-10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 269 airplanes
of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 

It would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspections at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $29,590, or $110 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 

It would take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed replacements at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,009 per airplane. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,541,781, or $9,449
per airplane. 

Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspections and 
replacements proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,571,371, or $9,559 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions 
even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 

A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
the original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed 
actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to
be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft

The Proposed Amendment



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 



 39.13 

[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:






McDonnell Douglas:

 Docket 94-NM-79-AD. 






Applicability:

 All Model DC-10-10, -10F, -15, -30, -30F, -40, and -40F series airplanes,
and KC-10A (military) airplanes; certificated in any category. 



Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 



To prevent undetected cracked or failed attach bolts that may lead to reduced structural integrity of the vertical
stabilizer, accomplish the following: 

(a) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking in the
attach bolts of the upper vertical stabilizer, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Service Bulletin
55-20, Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994, unless accomplished within the last 18 months prior to the effective
date of this AD in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Service Bulletin 55-20, Revision 1, dated March
8, 1991, or Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994.

(1) If no cracking is detected in any bolt, repeat the inspection of the uncracked bolt thereafter at intervals not
to exceed 18 months, until the requirements of paragraph (c) of this AD are accomplished. 

(2) If cracking is detected in any bolt, prior to further flight, replace the cracked bolt and associated nut with a
new Inconel attach bolt and associated nut, in accordance with the service bulletin. No further action is required
by this AD for the new Inconel bolts and associated nuts. 

(b) Compliance with the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD 
constitutes compliance with the inspections and reports required by paragraph (b) of AD 93-17-09, Amendment
39-8680, for Principal Structural Element (PSE) 55.10.001/002. However, after installation of new Inconel
bolts and associated nuts, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this AD, PSE 55.10.001/002
must continue to be inspected in accordance with AD 93-17-09. 

(c) Within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, replace all H-11 attach bolts and associated nuts of the
upper vertical stabilizer with new Inconel attach bolts and associated nuts, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas
DC-10 Service Bulletin 55-20, Revision 1, dated March 8, 1991; or Revision 2, dated August 4, 1994. Such
replacement constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. 

(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. 






Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Los Angeles ACO. 




(e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

Clean Air Act Proposed Interim Approval Operating Permits Program; the State of Arkansas 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed interim approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the Arkansas Department of Pollution
Control and Ecology (ADPCE) through the Governor of Arkansas for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements
which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary
sources, with the exception of sources on Indian Lands.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background and Purpose


A. Introduction


As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (``the Act''), the EPA has promulgated rules which define
the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250
(July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States
to develop, and submit to the EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and
to certain other sources, with the exception of sources on Indian Lands.
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to the EPA by November 15, 1993, and that the EPA act to
approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, the EPA may grant the program
interim approval for a period of up to two years. If the EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the November
15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.



II. Proposed Action and Implications


A. Analysis of State Submission


1. Support Materials


Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Act, the Governor of each State is required to develop and submit to the Administrator
an operating permit program under State or local law or under an interstate compact meeting the requirements of title
V of the Act. The Arkansas submittal was made under the signature of Governor Jim Guy Tucker in a letter to Acting Regional
Administrator, Joe Winkle, EPA, Region 6, dated October 29, 1993. The program will be implemented in all areas of the
State of Arkansas.
The State provided a general overview under Tab 1 of the submittal. This overview meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1)
by describing the State program in general terms.
Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the attorney general (or the
attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate
authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permit program. The Attorney General's (AG) Opinion appears
under Tab 3 of the submittal. The Opinion is signed by the Chief of the Legal Division, ADPCE, certifying full authority
to represent the State in all matters relating to the Department's environmental programs. This opinion adequately
addresses the thirteen provisions listed at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i)-(xiii). 
40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its permit program. The State
provides relevant program documentation under Tab 4 of the submittal. This documentation includes a complete application
form, permit form, and a guidance document. The submittal did not contain a model reporting form for the permitted
facilities to report emissions to the regulatory authority. However, Arkansas Regulation 26.7(a) references the
Federal reporting requirements at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3). These provisions must be included or formally incorporated
by reference. All sources subject to monitoring requirements must submit monitoring reports every six months and
must promptly report any deviation from permit requirements.
In the ADPCE operating permits program submittal, the ADPCE does not assert jurisdiction over Indian Lands or reservations.
To date, no Indian Lands have been identified in the State of Arkansas. Title V sources located on Indian Lands in Arkansas
will be subject to the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or subject to the operating
permits program of any Tribe delegated authority for treatment as a State under regulations being developed pursuant
to section 301(d) of the Act.



2. Regulations and Program Implementation


The State submitted under Tab 2, Regulation 26, ``Regulations of the Arkansas Operating Permit Program,'' as required
at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Regulation 26 follows the rule at 40 CFR part 70 very closely. Supporting documentation of procedurally
correct adoption and copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program,
including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. Regulation
26 received written comments from March 25 through April 24, 1993, and a public hearing was held April 14, 1993. The
response to comments was made by ADPCE on July 28, 1993. Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption
was submitted and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2).
The following requirements, set out in the EPA's part 70 regulation are addressed in the State's submittal: (a) Provisions
to determine applicability (40 CFR 70.3(a)), Regulation 26.3; (b) provisions to determine complete applications
(40 CFR 70.5(a)(2)), Regulation 26.4; (c) public participation (40 CFR 70.7(h)), Regulation 26.6; (d) provisions
for minor permit modifications (40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)), Regulation 26.10(b); (e) provisions for permit content (40
CFR 70.6(a)), Regulation 26.7; (f) provisions for operational flexibility (40 CFR 70.4(b)(12)), Regulation 26.8;
(g) enforcement provisions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(5) and 70.4(b)(4)(ii)), the AG Opinion and Tab 5 of the submittal, Compliance
Tracking and Enforcement.
Following is a discussion of certain specific provisions in the State's submission as they relate to requirements
of 40 CFR part 70:



(a) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emissions levels
(40 CFR 70.4(b)(2) and 70.3(a)): Applicability criteria are defined at Regulation 26.3. Regulation 26.3(a)(3)
specifies that new construction or modification at a part 70 source requires a new or modified part 70 permit before
construction begins. However, the State regulation does not require that a source must first undergo a preconstruction
permit review as outlined in Section 108, prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) supplement to the Arkansas
SIP. The SIP has been submitted for recodification, with the PSD provisions at Regulation 19.9, and has not yet been
acted on by the EPA. Regulation 26.3 must be amended to incorporate by reference the applicable PSD requirements.
Insignificant activities are addressed at Regulation 26.3(d) which refers to the SIP at Regulation 19.4(c). The
SIP lists the following emissions for which a permit is not required: 1) comfort heating, cooling, and ventilation
equipment; 2) portable internal combustion engines used in conjunction with temporary construction operations,
or emergency standby generators; or 3) natural gas and oil exploration and production site equipment. An exemption
may be obtained for these activities provided that operation of the equipment does not affect any provision of the
Federal Clean Air Act and does not contribute to an exceedance of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).
No other federally regulated emissions are allowed an exemption under Regulation 26.
(b) Provisions to determine complete applications are listed at Regulation 26.4. The State references the required
provisions for a complete application listed at 40 CFR 70.5(c). In order to receive full approval, the State must formally
incorporate these provisions by reference or list them specifically in the regulation. Recommended language for
formal incorporation by reference would read: ``The Department hereby adopts and incorporates by reference those
provisions of 40 CFR 70.5(c), as in effect on July 21, 1992.''
Complete application forms, model permit, and instructions are located under Tab 4 of the submittal. These application
forms may be amended without rulemaking to facilitate changes required by new applicable requirements. These provisions
meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2).
(c) Provisions for adequate public participation are found at Regulation 26.6. The State regulation provides for
adequate public participation and notice to affected States for permit issuance, renewals, and reopenings. These
provisions meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(h). 
(d) The rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2) specifies criteria for minor permit modifications that are incorporated in the State
regulations at Regulation 26.10(b). The rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) and Regulation 26.10(b)(7) prohibits
changes which constitute modifications under any provision of title I of the Act from being processed as a minor modification.
``Title I modifications'' in Arkansas, are determined by the permitting procedures federally approved into the
Arkansas Plan of Implementation for Air Pollution Control (SIP). The SIP, Regulation 19.2, defines any increase
in emissions as a modification. The State incorporates an additional criteria, Regulation 26.10(b)(1), that allows
the minor permit modification process to be used for permit modifications that involve emission increases. 
The additional criteria at Regulation 26.10(b)(1) allows the minor permit modification process to be used for permit
modifications that involve emission increases not over 20% of the applicable definition of major source, or 15 tons/year
of PM-10, or 0.6 tons/year of lead, whichever is less, based on potential to emit. 40 CFR 70.7(e)(3)(i) allows
group processing of minor modifications that collectively meet this emission threshold, or a total of 5 tons per year
(tpy) whichever is less, provided the minor modification criteria at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A) are also met. However,
the criteria for minor modifications at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A), which applies to individual as well as group processing
of minor modifications does not contain this allowance. 
Therefore, Regulation 26.10(b)(1) is inconsistent with the rule at 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5), as well as Regulation
26.10(b)(7). In order for Regulation 26 to provide minor modification procedures consistent with 40 CFR part 70,
and as a condition of full approval, the ADPCE must revise Regulation 26.10(b)(1) or delete the allowance from the
minor modification procedure.
(e) Provisions for permit content are found at Regulation 26.7. The State regulations require inclusion of the enumerated
elements at 40 CFR 70.6(a), (b), and (c). In order to receive full approval, the State must formally incorporate these
provisions by reference or list them specifically in the regulation. Recommended language for formal incorporation
by reference would read: ``The Department hereby adopts and incorporates by reference those provisions of 40 CFR
70.6(a), (b), and (c) as in effect on July 21, 1992.''
Additional provisions are found to provide for adequate permit duration, allow a permit shield, provide for general
permits, and provide for temporary sources and emergency situations.
Part 70 of the operating permits regulations requires prompt reporting of deviations from the permit requirements.
The rule at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) requires the permitting authority to define ``prompt'' in relation to the degree
and type of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements. The State of Arkansas has not defined ``prompt''
in Regulation 26, and must do so in order to achieve full approval. With formal incorporation by reference and defining
``prompt'' with regard to reporting deviations, the provisions at Regulation 26.7 meet the requirements of 40 CFR
70.6.
(f) Provisions for operational flexibility and alternative scenarios are listed at Regulation 26.8. This section
meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(12) by closely tracking the language of part 70.
(g) Enforcement provisions are discussed under Tab 5 of the submittal, Compliance Tracking and Enforcement Program.
This section contains copies of the Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding, signed May 3, 1993. The AG Opinion discussed
in section 1 above, outlines the State's authority to enforce all aspects of the program. Under Tab 9 of the submittal,
the State provides a commitment to submit annual information concerning the State's enforcement activities. These
submission elements meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and (5). 
The State of Arkansas has the authority to issue a variance from requirements imposed by State law under Arkansas Code,
Annotated (A.C.A.) 8-4-313. The EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the program submitted
for approval under part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action on this provision of State law. The EPA has
no authority to approve provisions of State law, such as the variance provision referred to, which are inconsistent
with the CAA. The EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty to comply
with a federally enforceable part 70 permit, except where such relief is granted through the procedures allowed by
part 70. A part 70 permit may be issued or revised (consistent with part 70 permitting procedures) to incorporate those
terms of a variance that are consistent with applicable requirements. A part 70 permit may also incorporate, via part
70 permit issuance or modification procedures, the schedule of compliance set forth in a variance. However, EPA reserves
the right to pursue enforcement of applicable requirements notwithstanding the existence of a compliance schedule
in a permit to operate. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C), which states that a schedule of compliance
``shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is
based.'' The State provides a legal position on variances in the AG Opinion, Section XXIII, page 9. Historically,
Arkansas has not granted a variance without approval from EPA. Counsel for the ADPCE commits to assure that variances
are not granted to part 70 sources.
The Arkansas operating permits program is contained in Regulation 26, but several applicable requirements are found
in Regulation 19 (e.g. PSD requirements at 19.9). The State of Arkansas has submitted a revision to Regulation 19 and
the EPA is currently undertaking a review of the revision. The EPA will continue to work closely with the State to ensure
consistency between the SIP permits system and operating permits systems in Arkansas. The EPA reserves comment on
the SIP revision until such time as review is completed. A subsequent notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 when the review is complete.



3. Permit Fee Demonstration


The State provided a detailed workload analysis and permit fee demonstration to justify the fee of $16 per ton per year.
Federal guidance recommends a presumptive minimum fee of $25 per ton per year, based on 1989 dollars and adjusted annually
by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The fee will be applied to the allowable emissions at each part 70 source. Approximately
$4.16 million dollars per year is expected to be generated by the Arkansas fee. This figure is based on the emissions
inventory and does not include hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission sources. Program costs are expected to run
approximately $3.6 million dollars per year. The State utilized historical information concerning permitting
costs and the emissions inventory to estimate the revenue required to fund the program. The EPA noted that the fee demonstration
does not estimate resource needs for section 112 programs that will be promulgated in the near future. Expansion of
the State program is anticipated to facilitate incorporation of these new requirements. The ADPCE has the authority
to adjust the fee as necessary using the State administrative procedures as new applicable requirements are promulgated.
The fee demonstration submitted by Arkansas meets the requirements at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(7) and (8).



4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act


The State of Arkansas acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval
of a program for delegation of unchanged section 112 standards under the authority of section 112(l) as they apply
to part 70 sources. Upon receiving approval under section 112(l), the State may receive delegation of any new authority
required by section 112 of the Act through the delegation process.
The State also has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements
in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions
promulgated by the EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged
Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations. 
The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State
operating permits program for part 70 sources. There is not yet a Federal definition of ``major'' for radionuclide
sources. Therefore, until a major source definition for radionuclides is promulgated, no source would be a major
section 112 source solely due to its radionuclide emissions. However, a radionuclide source may, in the interim,
be a major source under part 70 for another reason, thus requiring a part 70 permit. The EPA will work with the State in
the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner.
Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct,
reconstruct or modify any major source of HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology
emission limitation under section 112(g) will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis where
no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. During the period from the title V effective
date to the date the State has taken appropriate action to implement the final section 112(g) rule (either adoption
of the unchanged Federal rule or approval of an existing State rule under 112(l)), Arkansas intends to implement section
112(g) of the Act through the State's preconstruction process.
The State of Arkansas commits to appropriately implementing and enforcing the existing and future requirements
of sections 111, 112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated
in the future, in a timely manner. 
The submittal was amended with a letter from J.B. Jones, Chief of the Air Division, ADPCE, to Gerald Fontenot, Chief
of the Air Programs Branch, EPA, dated January 13, 1994. This letter commits the ADPCE to meet the January 1, 1995, deadline
for incorporation and submittal of the Federal acid rain program into the State regulations.



5. Enforcement Provisions


The Arkansas operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements under Tab 5 of the submittal.
This section contains, as required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and 70.4 (b)(5), the Enforcement Memorandum of Understanding,
signed by the State and the EPA on May 3, 1993. This information serves to describe the current processes in place to
track air permits and conduct enforcement actions. The State has committed to use the AIRS computer tracking system
in the operating permits program. Under Tab 9 of the submittal, the State committed to annual submission of information
concerning the State's enforcement activities. This submission, as required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(9), includes the
number of enforcement actions either commenced or concluded; the penalties, fines, and sentences obtained in those
actions; and the number of administrative orders issued. The AG's Opinion under Tab 3 of the submittal clearly documents
the State's authority to issue, inspect, and enforce operating permits in both civil and criminal actions. This statement
of authority is required at 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(vii).



6. Technical Support Document


The results of this review will be shown in a document entitled ``Technical Support Document,'' which will be available
in the docket at the locations noted above. The technical support documentation shows that all operating permits
program requirements of 40 CFR part 70 and relevant guidance were met by the submittal with the exception of those requirements
described below.



7. Summary


The State of Arkansas submitted to the EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor, the State's operating permits program
on November 9, 1993. The submittal has adequately addressed all sixteen elements required for full approval as discussed
in part 70 with the exception of the issues described in section B below. The State of Arkansas addressed appropriately
all requirements necessary to receive interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title
V of the Act, 1990 Amendments and 40 CFR part 70. The EPA is proposing interim approval for the operating permits program
submittal for the State of Arkansas.
 


B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications


The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by the State of Arkansas
on November 9, 1993. Interim approvals under section 502(g) of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. If promulgated, the State must make the following changes
to receive full approval:

PSD Applicability

. As discussed in section A.2.a above, the provisions at Regulation 26.3(a)(3) should incorporate by reference the
PSD requirements in the State regulations applicable to new construction and modification.

(2) 

Incorporation by Reference

. As discussed in section A.2.b and A.2.e above, the State must formally incorporate the part 70 provisions referenced
in Regulation 26 regarding complete application requirements and permit content requirements.

(3) 

Minor Modification Procedures

. As discussed in section A.2.d above, the State must remove or revise the language at Regulation 26.10(b)(1).
 
(4) 

Definition of ``prompt''

. As discussed in section A.2.e above, the State must define ``prompt'' with regard to reporting deviations in order
to be consistent with the rule at 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B).
 
(5) 

Submission of Regulation 19

. As discussed in section A.2 above, The State of Arkansas must ensure consistency between the operating permits program,
Regulation 26, and the SIP, Regulation 19.




Evidence of these regulatory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted to EPA within 18
months of EPA's approval of the Arkansas operating permits program. This interim approval, which may not be renewed,
extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for
failure to have a program, and the EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permits program in the State. Permits
issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to 40 CFR part 70, and the one year time
period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the three year
time period for processing the initial permit applications.
If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover,
the EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Requirements for approval, specified
in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for delegation of section 112 standards as
promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate
authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements
under 40 CFR part 70. 



III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 


In this action, EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of Arkansas.
The program was submitted by the State to EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found at the 1990
Amendments, title V and at part 70, which mandates that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating
permits to all major stationary sources and certain other sources, with the exception of Indian Lands. Therefore,
the EPA is also promulgating approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving
delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards as promulgated. This program for delegations
only applies to sources covered by the part 70 program.
EPA has reviewed this submittal of the Arkansas operating permits program and is proposing interim approval. Certain
defects in the State's regulations preclude EPA from granting full approval of the State's operating permits program
at this time. EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the State obtaining the needed regulatory revisions
within 18 months after the Administrator's approval of the Arkansas title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4.



IV. Administrative Requirements


A. Request for Public Comments 


The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information
relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The
docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, the EPA in
the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are:



(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the rulemaking process; and






(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review.






The EPA will consider any comments received by October 19, 1994.






B. Executive Order 12866






The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.






C. Regulatory Flexibility Act






Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities, (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA
may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 






Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the
EPA to base its actions concerning operating permits programs on such grounds, (

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery
of the South Atlantic Region (FMP). This rule would change the minimum size limits of certain species, require charter
vessels/headboats and dealers to obtain Federal permits, clarify one of the earned income requirements for a vessel
permit, restrict the sale/purchase of snapper-grouper species, modify the criteria for determining when a vessel
is operating as a headboat, modify the requirements for possessing multi-day bag limits, specify allowable gear,
authorize permits for experimental fishing, and modify the management unit for scup. In addition, NMFS proposes
changes to correct and clarify certain regulations, or conform them to current standards. The intended effects of
this rule are to conserve snapper-grouper species and enhance effective management of the snapper-grouper fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Snapper-grouper species off the southern Atlantic states are managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the South
Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council), and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 646, under
the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



Background 



Recent scientific stock assessments and public testimony have identified a number of snapper-grouper species as
being overfished. The management measures in Amendment 7 are designed to prevent this overfishing, rebuild the overfished
species, and manage the fishery in a more orderly manner. 



Size Limits for Hogfish and Mutton Snapper 



Amendment 7 would establish a minimum size limit of 12 inches (30.5 cm), fork length, for hogfish and increase the minimum
size limit for mutton snapper from 12 inches (30.5 cm) to 16 inches (40.6 cm), total length. The proposed 12-inch (30.5-cm)
minimum size limit for hogfish is based on the minimum size/age at which hogfish transform from female to male. The
proposed 16-inch (40.6-cm) minimum size limit for mutton snapper corresponds to the size/age of sexual maturity.
Sex transformation of hogfish and sexual maturity for mutton snapper are essential to prevent overfishing and maintain
the productivity of these species. In addition, the proposed minimum size limits would increase yield-per-recruit
for each species. 



Annual Charter Vessel and Headboat Permits 



Amendment 7 would require a vessel that operates as a charter vessel or headboat in the snapper-grouper fishery in
the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), or that possesses fish in the snapper-grouper fishery in or from the EEZ while so
operating, to have on board a charter vessel/headboat permit for such fishery. Charter vessels and headboats catch
substantial quantities of snapper-grouper species, and it is essential that these landings be documented for assessment
purposes. A permit system would provide a census for this sector of the fishery. 



Annual Dealer Permits 



Amendment 7 would require a dealer to obtain a permit in order to receive snapper-grouper species, excluding wreckfish,
that are harvested in the EEZ. Currently, a permit is required for a dealer to receive wreckfish. To be eligible for
a dealer permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, an applicant would have to have a valid state wholesaler's
license in the state where he or she operates and a physical facility for the receipt of fish at a fixed location in that
state. Dealer permits for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, would (1) Improve quota monitoring by providing
a census of snapper-grouper dealers, (2) enhance the enforceability of commercial trip limits for snowy grouper
and golden tilefish, and (3) aid in verifying required fishing vessel logbook submissions. 



Earned Income Requirement for Commercial Permits 



Amendment 7 proposes to clarify the gross-sales-of-fish alternative requirement for a vessel permit for snapper-grouper,
excluding wreckfish. Currently, an applicant may show gross sales of fish exceeding $20,000 during 1 of the 3 years
preceding the application. Under Amendment 7, such sales would have to be of fish harvested by the applicant for the
permit. The Council is concerned that some vessel owners may have obtained permits through the artifice of purchasing
and reselling fish harvested by others. Such practice does not meet the Council's intent for qualifying for a permit.
In FMP Amendment 4, the Council clearly stated that the income and gross sales requirements are intended to allow those
who are committed to commercial fishing, in terms of capital investment or earned income, to continue making their
livelihood from fishing. Specifically, the Council intends that the commercial fishing permits be for those vessels
whose owners or operators have a history of income from harvesting and selling fish. 



Restrictions on Sale/Purchase of Snapper-Grouper 



Amendment 7 proposes requirements that snapper-grouper species, excluding wreckfish, harvested in the EEZ (1)
Be sold only to a dealer with a valid permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish; and (2) be purchased only from
a vessel that has a valid permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, or from a person with a valid state commercial
license to sell fish. In addition, sale/purchase of such fish would be limited to the bag limit amounts unless sale/purchase
involved snapper-grouper harvested by a vessel with a valid permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish. These
measures would improve fishery statistics that will be used in assessments of the biological condition of snapper-grouper
species. The improved data base will also allow scientists to estimate more accurately the social and economic value
of various fishing sectors. Economic and social analyses based on fishery statistics allow managers to evaluate
the effectiveness of management measures. 



Headboat Crew Specification 



The current regulations specify that, if a headboat has a vessel permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish,
it is considered to be operating as a headboat when it carries a passenger who pays a fee or when there are more than three
persons aboard, including operator and crew. When operating as a headboat, the bag limits apply. Amendment 7 proposes
to remove the specification of three persons aboard and, in its place, allow the number of persons aboard to be up to
the number of crew specified in the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. This measure would, in some cases, allow a
permitted headboat to be exempt from the bag limits when it has more than three persons aboard. The Council believes
that the number of crew specified on the Certificate of Inspection would allow safer operation of the vessel when fishing
and, to the extent that the number of crew allowed exceeds three, should improve the economic efficiency of affected
headboats if they operate as commercial fishing vessels.

Possession Limits 


A current criterion for the possession aboard a charter 
vessel or headboat of multi-day bag limits is that the vessel 
have two licensed operators aboard. Amendment 7 would delete 
this criterion. The Council believes the two-licensed operators 
aboard criterion has no reasonable biological or management 
correlation with multi-day bag limits. NMFS believes that this 
action should have little impact on the fishery, notwithstanding 
the Council's indication in Amendment 7 that this measure 
possibly may decrease income to operators/owners of charter 
vessels and headboats. 


Gear Limitations 


Under Amendment 7, the only gear authorized in a directed 
fishery for snapper-grouper species would be vertical hook-and-line gear, including hand-held rods and rods attached
to a vessel 
(bandit gear), in either case, with manual, electric, or 
hydraulic reels; spearfishing gear; bottom longlines; and sea 
bass pots. All other gear would be prohibited. Limits would be 
imposed on the possession and transfer of snapper-grouper species 
by vessels with unauthorized gear aboard. An exception to the 
possession limits would apply in the case of a permitted vessel 
that fishes in the EEZ off North Carolina with a sink net aboard. 
In addition, the use of bottom longlines to fish for 
snapper-grouper species in the EEZ south of St. Lucie Inlet, FL, 
would be prohibited; the use of powerheads to harvest snapper- 
grouper species in the EEZ off South Carolina would be 
prohibited; and the use of rebreathers to harvest snapper-grouper 
species with spearfishing gear in the EEZ off the southern 
Atlantic states would be prohibited. 
The concept of allowable gear allows managers to regulate 
the fishery more efficiently by enabling managers to test gear 
before it becomes widespread. This concept would enhance law 
enforcement by establishing standard gear. Environmental damage 
to the habitat would be minimized because gear would have to be 
evaluated before it could be used. Testing of experimental gear 
would minimize the possibility that very efficient gear could 
cause recruitment failure of the snapper grouper resource if it 
were allowed to be used throughout the fishery. 
The exception applicable to the use of sink nets off North 
Carolina would allow fishermen in that area to operate with 
multiple gears on a trip, that is, it would allow retention of 
snapper-grouper harvested with sea bass pots and/or vertical 
hook-and-line gear and fish harvested with a sink net. A sink 
net has virtually no bycatch of snapper-grouper species and is 
continuously tended, which minimizes the possibility of lost gear 
and ghost fishing. Therefore, the Council believes that sink 
nets, as used off North Carolina, do not pose the problems to the 
snapper-grouper fishery normally associated with entanglement 
nets. This exception would improve the economic efficiency of 
fishermen in North Carolina who are accustomed to using sink nets 
and authorized gear on a trip. 
The Council is proposing to ban the use of bottom longlines 
to fish for snapper-grouper species south of St. Lucie, FL, to 
increase the standing stock of tilefish in that area. The 
Council believes that the prohibition of bottom longlines will 
decrease fishing mortality on tilefish; hence, it should aid in 
the prevention of growth and recruitment overfishing. Also, the 
Council believes that banning bottom longline gear will reduce 
competition among traditional bandit gear commercial fishermen, 
recreational anglers, and longline fishermen and will result in 
reduced habitat damage. The Council noted that the continental 
shelf edge is quite narrow south of St. Lucie Inlet, and does not 
want a bottom longline fishery to develop that would lead to 
conflict among the competing user groups in that area. 
South Carolina prohibits the use of powerheads in its 
waters, and powerheads cannot be used in the special management 
zones in the EEZ off South Carolina. The Council's proposed ban 
on the use of powerheads in the entire EEZ off South Carolina is 
intended to enhance enforceability of the prohibition of 
powerheads in State waters. This measure would result in 
consistent State and Federal regulations off South Carolina. The 
Council also believes that the ban on use of powerheads in the 
EEZ would reduce conflict between recreational and commercial 
divers that appears to be a particular problem in the EEZ off 
South Carolina. 
The Council believes that the use of rebreathers 
significantly increases the efficiency of divers using 
spearfishing gear. The use of rebreathers eliminates bubbles, 
thus allowing divers to stalk fish more easily. The Council is 
concerned about the status of gag, which are particularly 
vulnerable to divers when they aggregate to spawn. The 
prohibition of rebreathers would lessen fishing mortality on the 
spawning aggregations, which will assist in prevention of 
recruitment overfishing. Amberjack are also targeted by divers 
during spawning periods, and this measure would also reduce 
fishing mortality on that species and lessen the chance of 
recruitment overfishing. 


Experimental Fishing 


Under Amendment 7, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, 
(Regional Director) would be authorized to issue permits for 
experimental fishing, provided that, as a condition of such 
permits, data on the gear used and fish caught in such 
experimental fishing must be maintained and provided to the 
Science and Research Director. Experimental fishing would 
provide an opportunity to test new gear for possible 
authorization for use in the snapper-grouper fishery. 


Management Unit for Scup 


Amendment 7 proposes to modify the management unit for scup, 


Stenotomus chrysops,

 so that management under the FMP would apply 
only south of Cape Hatteras. Scup are found from the North/South 
Carolina border to the U.S.-Canada border with a division of 
stocks at Cape Hatteras. The northern stock of scup is 
overfished and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council is 
considering measures to rebuild that stock. The proposed 
modification of the management unit would allow the Mid-Atlantic 
Council to manage the northern stock of scup throughout its 
range. This is a conservation measure that would result in more 
efficient management of this resource. 


Comments Requested 


While NMFS is inviting comments on all of the measures in 
Amendment 7, comments are specifically invited on the following 
concerns about provisions of the allowable gear measure. (1) 
What are the effects of prohibiting the use of bottom longlines 
south of St. Lucie Inlet, FL ? (2) What are the effects of 
prohibiting the use of powerheads in the EEZ off South Carolina?

In addition to the measures in this rule, discussed above, 
Amendment 7 would add localized depletion to the FMP's list of 
problems in the snapper-grouper fishery. It would add FMP 
objectives to evaluate and minimize localized depletion and 
modify the framework procedure for implementing or adjusting 
certain management measures to allow the Council to react more 
quickly to changing resource conditions. The proposed change to 
the framework procedure would allow the Council to initiate and 
implement necessary changes at any time during the fishing year 
instead of only prior to each fishing year. Revision of 50 CFR 
part 646 is not required to effect these changes. 
Background and rationale for the additional measures in 
Amendment 7, and for the measures in this rule, discussed above, 
are contained in Amendment 7, the availability of which was 
announced in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 42570, August 18, 1994). 


Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS 


NMFS proposes to change the title of part 646 to ``Snapper-Grouper Fishery Off the Southern Atlantic States,'' with

concomitant changes of the language in the codified text, to more 
correctly indicate the geographical scope of the regulations. 
The address in the definition of ``Regional Director'' would 
be changed to reflect a recent move. 
The requirement that an applicant for a dealer permit for 
wreckfish must have a physical facility at a fixed location would 
be changed to clarify that such facility must be for the receipt 
of fish, rather than merely a mailing address. 


Classification 


Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires NMFS to 
publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of 
receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time, NMFS has 
not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is 
consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the 
Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making that 
determination, will take into account the data, views, and 
comments received during the comment period. 
This action has been determined to be not significant 
for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation 
of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed 
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities because neither gross 
revenues nor compliance costs would be significantly changed. 
All participants in the fishery are small entities. As a result, 
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
This rule contains three collection-of-information 
requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_namely, 
applications for charter vessel/headboat permits, applications 
for dealer permits, and applications for experimental fishing 
permits. These requirements have been submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. The public reporting 
burdens for these collections of information are estimated to 
average 20 minutes, 5 minutes, and 1 hour per response, 
respectively, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the 
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection-of-information. Send comments regarding these reporting
burden 
estimates or any other aspect of these collections of 
information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to 
NMFS and OMB (see
