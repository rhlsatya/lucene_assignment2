NIST Docket No. 92-016





Title: 

A Chemically Assisted Process for the Machining of Ceramics 



Description: 

A new NIST process makes the matching of ceramic materials more practical and cost-effective. The process uses halogenated
hydrocarbons to machine ceramic materials. This increases the rate of material removal by 40-100 percent and
reduces the surface roughness by 40-60 percent. 



NIST Docket No. 92-056





Title:

 Serial/Parallel Correlator for Words and Phrases 



Description: 

A novel computer method allows for more efficient identification of misspelled words contained in large databases.
The method is readily applicable for improving the reliability of ``mechanical eyes'' used, for example, for sorting
mail or reading Census Bureau forms. 



NIST Docket No. 93-001





Title: 

Intermetallic Titanium-Aluminum-Niobium-Chromium Alloys 



Description: 

NIST researchers have developed new alloys that possess superior combinations of room and high temperature mechanical
properties. These low density titanium-aluminum-niobium-chromium alloys could find use in a new generation of
jet turbines, in aircraft bodies, or as metal-matrix composites. 




NIST Docket No. 93-004D





Title: 

Method for the Production of Predetermined Concentration Graded Alloys



Description: 

NIST researchers have designed a new process for tailoring extremely thin metal layers within an alloy. The process
allows strength, conductivity, thermal expansion and other properties to be optimized at various levels below a
material surface. 



NIST Docket No. 93-026





Title: 

Method of Obtaining High Green Density Ceramics From Powders 



Description: 

This invention is a novel method of preparing slurries of fine ceramic powders in which the ceramic particles are dispersed

Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses:


In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information
contained therein may specifically be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as
follows:
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide military personnel and pay data for present and former military
personnel for the purpose of evaluating use of veterans benefits, validating benefit eligibility and maintaining
the health and well being of veterans.
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide identifying military personnel data to the DVA and its contractor,
the Prudential Insurance Company, for the purpose of notifying members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) of their
right to apply for Veteran's Group Life Insurance coverage.
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to register eligible veterans and their dependents for DVA programs.
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), for the purpose of:
1. Providing full identification of active duty military personnel, including full-time National Guard/Reserve
support personnel, for use in the administration of DVA's Compensation and Pension benefit program (38 U.S.C. 3104(c),
3006-3008). The information is used to determine continued eligibility for DVA disability compensation to
recipients who have returned to active duty so that benefits can be adjusted or terminated as required and steps taken
by DVA to collect any resulting over payment.
2. Providing military personnel and financial data to the Veterans Benefits Administration, DVA for the purpose
of determining initial eligibility and any changes in eligibility status to insure proper payment of benefits for
GI Bill education and training benefits by the DVA under the Montgomery GI Bill (Title 10 U.S.C., Chapter 106 -
Selected Reserve and Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30 - Active Duty). The administrative responsibilities designated
to both agencies by the law require that data be exchanged in administering the programs.
3. Providing identification of reserve duty, including full-time support National Guard/Reserve military personnel,
to the DVA, for the purpose of deducting reserve time served from any DVA disability compensation paid or waiver of
VA benefit. The law (10 U.S.C. 684) prohibits receipt of reserve pay and DVA compensation for the same time period,
however, it does permit waiver of DVA compensation to draw reserve pay.
4. Providing identification of former active duty military personnel who received separation payments to the DVA
for the purpose of deducting such repayment from any DVA disability compensation paid. The law (38 U.S.C. 3104(c))
requires recoupment of severance payments before DVA disability compensation can be paid.
5. Providing identification of former military personnel and survivor's financial benefit data to DVA for the purpose
of identifying military retired pay and survivor benefit payments for use in the administration of the DVA's Compensation
and Pension program (38 U.S.C. 3104(c), 3006-3008). The information is to be used to process all DVA award actions
more efficiently, reduce subsequent overpayment collection actions, and minimize erroneous payments.
To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consisting of personnel/employment/financial data for the purpose
of carrying out OPM's management functions. Records disclosed concern pay, benefits, retirement deductions and
any other information necessary for those management functions required by law (Pub. L. 83-598, 84-356,
86-724, 94-455 and 5 U.S.C. 1302, 2951, 3301, 3372, 4118, 8347).
To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) for the purpose of:
1. Exchanging personnel and financial information on certain military retirees, who are also civilian employees
of the Federal government, for the purpose of identifying those individuals subject to a limitation on the amount
of military retired pay they can receive under the Dual Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5532), and to permit adjustments
of military retired pay by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and to take steps to recoup excess of that permitted
under the dual compensation and pay cap restrictions.
2. Exchanging personnel and financial data on civil service annuitants (including disability annuitants under
age 60) who are reemployed by DOD to insure that annuities of DOD reemployed annuitants are terminated where applicable,
and salaries are correctly offset where applicable as required by law (5 U.S.C. 8331, 8344, 8401 and 8468).
3. Exchanging personnel and financial data to identify individuals who are improperly receiving military retired
pay and credit for military service in their civil service annuities, or annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum'
disability formula. The match will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement
Act (CSRA) 5 U.S.C. 8331 and the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA) 5 U.S.C. 8411. DOD's legal authority
for monitoring retired pay is 10 U.S.C. 1401.
4. Exchanging civil service and Reserve military personnel data to identify those individuals of the Reserve forces
who are employed by the Federal government in a civilian position. The purpose of the match is to identify those particular
individuals occupying critical positions as civilians and cannot be released for extended active duty in the event
of mobilization. Employing Federal agencies are informed of the reserve status of those affected personnel so that
a choice of terminating the position or the reserve assignment can be made by the individual concerned. The authority
for conducting the computer match is contained in E.O. 11190, Providing for the Screening of the Ready Reserve of the
Armed Services.
To the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of obtaining home addresses to contact Reserve component members
for mobilization purposes and for tax administration. For the purpose of conducting aggregate statistical analyses
on the impact of DOD personnel of actual changes in the tax laws and to conduct aggregate statistical analyses to lifestream
earnings of current and former military personnel to be used in studying the comparability of civilian and military
pay benefits. To aid in administration of Federal Income Tax laws and regulations, to identify non-compliance and
delinquent filers.

child support offices in locating absent parents in order to establish and/or enforce child support obligations.
3. To the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), DHHS for the purpose of monitoring HCFA reimbursement to civilian
hospitals for Medicare patient treatment. The data will ensure no Department of Defense physicians, interns or residents
are counted for HCFA reimbursement to hospitals. 
4. To the Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Research and Statistics, DHHS for the purpose of conducting
statistical analyses of impact of military service and use of GI Bill benefits on long term earnings.
5. To the Bureau of Supplemental Security Income, SSA, DHHS to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the
Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), for the purpose of verifying information provided to the SSA by applicants
and recipients who are retired military members or their survivors for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.
By law (42 U.S.C. 1383) the SSA is required to verify eligibility factors and other relevant information provided
by the SSI applicant from independent or collateral sources and obtain additional information as necessary before
making SSI determinations of eligibility, payment amounts or adjustments thereto. 
6. To HHS for the purpose of conducting studies concerned with the health and well being of the active duty and veteran
population.
To the Selective Service System (SSS) for the purpose of facilitating compliance of members and former members of
the Armed Forces, both active and reserve, with the provisions of the Selective Service registration regulations
(50 U.S.C. App. 451 and E.O. 11623).
To DOD Civilian Contractors for the purpose of performing research on manpower problems for statistical analyses.

regulated by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), for the purpose of exchanging personnel and financial
information on certain retired USCG military members, who are also civilian employees of the Federal government,
for the purpose of identifying those individuals subject to a limitation on the amount of military pay they can receive
under the Dual Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5532), and to permit adjustments of military retired pay by the U.S. Coast
Guard and to take steps to recoup excess of that permitted under the dual compensation and pay cap restrictions.
To the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide data contained in this record system that includes
the name, Social Security Number, salary and retirement pay for the purpose of verifying continuing eligibility
in HUD's assisted housing programs maintained by the Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and subsidized multi-family
project owners or management agents. Data furnished will be reviewed by HUD or the PHAs with the technical assistance
from the HUD Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to determine whether the income reported by tenants to the PHA or

According to Granite State, the revised rates on Second Revised Sheet No. 24 are applicable to its Rate Schedule LMS
(Load Management Service) which provides for swings in excess of the daily variance tolerance above or below scheduled

for its Rate Schedule LMS service are identical with and track the rates for Tennessee's underlying service.

Granite State also states that Tennessee filed revised tariff sheets in its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume

Granite State proposes in its filing to track the change in the Tennessee rate effective September 1, 1994, rather
than retroactively.

According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served on its Rate Schedule LMS customers, Bay State Gas Company
and Northern Utilities, Inc., and the regulatory commissions of the states of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Rate Filing</DOCTITLE>



September 13, 1994.





Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 25, First Revised Sheet No. 159, and First Revised
Sheet No. 159A.


Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's Fifth Order on Compliance Filing
and Fourth Order on Rehearing in Tennessee's restructuring proceeding. 68 FERC 61,001 at 61,002 (1994). Tennessee
requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of October 1, 1994.

Tennessee states that in the Fifth Tennessee Restructuring Order, the Commission denied Tennessee's request for
rehearing regarding the crediting of revenues from Extended Receipt and Delivery Services because it felt that the
services were essentially interruptible in nature. However, the Commission invited Tennessee to make a limited
Section 4 filing to alter its Extended Receipt and Delivery Services in order to make them true firm services. The instant
filing would require that shippers desiring Extended Receipt or Delivery Service reserve and pay for such capacity
for at least three days. Thus Tennessee states that the proposed sheets comply with the Commission's holdings in 

Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co.

 65 FERC 61,130 (1993) and 

ANR Pipeline Co.

 64 FERC 61,140 (1993) as required by the Fifth Restructuring Order.

Tennessee requests a waiver of the Commission's 30 day prior notice requirements in order that the proposed tariff
sheets may go into effect on October 1, 1994. Implementation at this time will allow Tennessee to gain experience in
scheduling the new Extended Receipt and Delivery Service prior to increased system demands that will result from
colder weather. While Tennessee does not believe any additional waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully
requests that the Commission grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.

Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.


Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a petition to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426,
in accordance with Sections 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214.
All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file and available
for public inspection.

supplement a filing made on August 30, 1994, and noticed as Docket No. RP94-375-000. That filing described
Schedules 1 through 10, which were supposed to be attached in support of Account No. 191 costs to be direct billed by
Texas Gas. Therefore, Texas Gas is submitting Schedules 1 through 10 to correct the inadvertent error caused by not
attaching the schedules to its filing made on August 30, 1994.

Texas Gas states that copies of the letter of transmittal and attachments are being mailed to all those receiving the
August 30, 1994, filing, which included Texas Gas's affected former jurisdictional sales customers and interested
state commissions, as well as to all parties on the service list in Docket No. RP94-125.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests
should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file
with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.

 Notice of implementation of special refund 
procedures.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the procedures for disbursement
of $52,092.73, plus accrued interest, in refined petroleum overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial
Order issued to Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset) Case No. LEF-0112. The OHA has determined that the funds will
be distributed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V and 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act (PODRA). 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $52,092.73,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Sunset Boulevard
Car Wash (Sunset) on October 22, 1980. Under the Remedial Order, Sunset was found to have violated the Federal petroleum
price and allocation regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products between August 1, 1979 and January
27, 1980 (the Audit period). 





The OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of Sunset motor gasoline
will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who
satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of gasoline they
purchased from Sunset during the audit period. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been
disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum
Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). 



Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications
have been set forth in Section IV of the Decision immediately following this notice. Refund applications should be
mailed to the address listed at the beginning of this notice. 



Unless labelled as ``confidential'', all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours
of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal 
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E-234, 1000 Independence
Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy 




Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 



Name of Firm: Sunset Boulevard Car Wash 
Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 
Case Number: LEF-0112 







Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)
may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund proceedings. 10
CFR 205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE
price regulations. 



In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by ERA on
July 20, 1993. In that Petition, ERA specifically requests that we formulate refund procedures to disburse funds
that had been remitted to DOE by Sunset Boulevard Car Wash (Sunset). The funds at issue in that Petition were obtained
through a Remedial Order (the Order) issued by our Office on October 22, 1980. 



Under the terms of the Order, Sunset remitted $52,092.73 to the DOE to remedy pricing violations which Sunset committed
between August 1, 1979 and January 27, 1980.

1

 These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the Treasury pending a determination of their proper
distribution. The present Decision and Order sets forth final procedures for the distribution of those funds to qualified
purchasers of Sunset's refined products. 




I. Jurisdiction and Authority 




The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify the persons who
were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each
person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion procedures to
distribute refunds, see 

Office of Enforcement, 

9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement, 

8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 



II. Background 




The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Sunset was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined
at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 210 and 10 CFR part 212, subpart F. The Order
states that from August 1, 1979 to January 27, 1980 (the audit period), Sunset charged prices higher than those permitted
by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation
of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make its records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b). 


Sunset was ordered to reduce its prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of gasoline
had been sold at reduced prices to remedy the violations.

2

 After decontrol, the Order was modified to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. See 

Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 

20 FERC  62,319 at 63,537 (

Sunset

) (1982). Under the terms of the modified Order (the MO), Sunset was required to disgorge and remit to DOE the violation
amount and the profits it had acquired as a result of its violation of the aforementioned provisions of the pricing
regulations. 





Sunset objected to the remedial provisions of the MO at every available tier of administrative and judicial review.
As a result, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) affirmed the MO on August 12, 1982. When Sunset renewed
its objections in proceedings before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the
District Court affirmed the MO. Finally, on March 9, 1993, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals definitively
disposed of Sunset's objections. 

Bush 

v. 

U.S.

, 989 F.2d 509 (Em. App. 1993). 




III. The Proposed Decision and Order 





On November 24, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the funds that Sunset had remitted to DOE pursuant to the MO. We proposed implementing a two stage refund proceeding
and we stated that purchasers of Sunset motor gasoline would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications
in the first stage. In the event funds remained after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the
remaining funds would be disbursed in the second stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4501) (PODRA). 



We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received
no comments since the PDO was published in the 

Federal Register

 more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally
outlined. Set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications
during the first stage, as well as, the provisions governing distribution of any remaining funds in the second stage
proceeding. 



IV. First Stage Refund Procedures 





Refund applications submitted in the Sunset special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner
as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we often adopt rebuttable
presumptions which relate to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our belief that adoption of these
presumptions permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger numbers by avoiding the need to incur
inordinate expense; and facilitates our consideration of first stage refund applications. 10 CFR 205.282(e). For
those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding.

(1) Calculating the Refund 



We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout Sunset's motor gasoline sales during
the audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on a volumetric
basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined product each
applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric) established for this proceeding, plus accrued
interest. Applicants believing they were disproportionately overcharged by the pricing violations may present
documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in showing they were disproportionately overcharged
by Sunset will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric. 

The volumetric for this proceeding has been set at $.0868 per gallon. This figure was obtained by dividing the remedial
order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline Sunset is believed to have sold during the audit period.

3 







(2) Eligibility for a Refund 



In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) document the volume of motor
gasoline it purchased during the audit period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by Sunset's overcharges. The
threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement is typically
satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund is sought
and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application.

The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially
those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb
Sunset's overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained
a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit the applicant to pass
through those increased costs. See, 

Quintana Energy Corp., 

21 DOE  85,032 at 88,117 (1991).

Unless simplified application procedures were provided, we recognized that the cost to the applicant of gathering
evidence of injury to support a relatively small refund claim could exceed the expected refund and thereby cause some
injured parties to be denied an opportunity to obtain a refund. Moreover, simplified procedures were needed to minimize
the burden that would be placed on this Office if we found it necessary to analyze a detailed injury showing for large
numbers of small refund applications. In view of these difficulties, we proposed adopting a number of injury presumptions
which simplify and streamline the refund process.



(3) Presumptions of Injury



Each presumption of injury turns on the category of applicant. Set forth below is the presumption of injury that has
been adopted for each class of applicant likely to submit a refund application in this proceeding.



Small-claim Presumption

. We have adopted a small claim presumption of injury for resellers, retailers and refiners whose claim is $10,000
or less, exclusive of interest. A small claim threshold of $10,000 has been adopted, even though we established a lower
threshold amount of $5,000 in many prior proceedings. See, e.g., 

Gulf Oil Corporation

, 16 DOE  85,381 (1987)(establishing a $5,000 threshold). The $10,000 threshold is more appropriate here because
the volumetric for this proceeding is significantly higher than the volumetric set in Gulf and in most other proceedings.


Id.

 If we were to adopt a lower threshold amount for this proceeding, then the high volumetric would increase substantially
the number of very small firms that would be burdened with the requirement to make a detailed injury showing before
they become eligible to receive their full allocable share.

The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive
of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline
he or she purchased from Sunset during the audit period in order to be eligible to receive a full refund. See 

Enron Corporation

, 21 DOE  85,323 at 88,957 (1991).



Mid-range Presumption

. Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding
interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants,
these applicants will only be required to document the volume of Sunset gasoline they purchased during the audit period
to be eligible to receive refunds. See 

Shell

, 17 DOE at 88,406. 



End-user Presumption.

 We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry
and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973
(EPAA), 15 U.S.C.   751-760h, were injured by Sunset's pricing violations. Unlike regulated firms,
end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required to keep
records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of the alleged
overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding.
See 

American Pacific International, Inc.,

 14 DOE  85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed to
have been injured by Sunset's pricing violations. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document
the volume of Sunset product they purchased during the audit period. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive
their full allocable share. See 

Shell,

 17 DOE at 88,406.



Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants

. Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence
of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers.
They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases. 

Id.

 

We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers
or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from Sunset. Such applicants may nonetheless submit refund applications
if they purchased motor gasoline from Sunset during the audit period. Any such applicants must demonstrate that they
purchased products from Sunset during the audit period and show they were injured as a result of their purchases to
be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding. Regulated firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement
to show injury. They must, however, show that they will pass through to their customers any refunds they receive. 



(4) How to Apply for a Refund 



To apply for a refund from the Sunset settlement fund, an applicant must submit an Application for Refund containing
all of the following information:




(1) The Applicant's name; the current name and address of the business for which the refund is sought; the name and address
during the refund period of the business for which the refund is sought; the taxpayer identification number; a statement
specifying whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or other business
entity; the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for additional information; and the name and address
of the person who should receive any refund check.
 If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant
should specify those names.





(2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an
applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available,
the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable
and must be explained.

(3) A statement indicating whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has been authorized to file on its behalf,
any other application in this refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the other filing or
authorization should be submitted; 

(4) If the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with the consenting firm, in this case Sunset Boulevard Car Wash,
the applicant should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated. If not, a statement
that the applicant was not affiliated with the consenting firm.

(5) The statement listed below, provided it has been signed by the applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing
the refund application:

I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal
government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understand that the information
contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application
which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room.

 


All applications should be either typed or printed and should clearly refer to the appropriate proceeding name (Sunset
Boulevard Car Wash) and case number (LEF-0112). Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application.
If the applicant believes that any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish this information
to be publicly disclosed, the applicant must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential'',
containing the confidential information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted.
All refund applications should be postmarked no later than June 1, 1995, and sent to: Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, LEF-0112,
Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. 



(5) Minimal Amount Requirement 



Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund
proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution
in those instances. See 

Mobil Oil Corporation

, 13 DOE  85,339 (1985). Using the volumetric methodology, an applicant must have purchased at least 173 gallons
of Sunset motor gasoline in order for its claim to be considered in this proceeding. 



(6) Additional Information 



OHA reserves the authority to require additional information before granting any refund in these proceedings. Applications
lacking the required information may be dismissed or denied. 



(7) Refund Applications Filed by Representatives 



OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications submitted
by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in this final Decision and Order. Strict compliance
with the filing requirement as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the
accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant, will be required. 



(8) Filing Deadline 



The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995. 



V. Second Stage Refund Procedures 



Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of PODRA, 15 U.S.C. 4501-07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil
overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those
funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these
responsibilities to OHA, and any funds that OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured
customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. 



It Is Therefore Ordered That:

 

Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, pursuant
to the Remedial Order finalized on October 22, 1980, may now be filed.

 


Dated: September 12, 1994.

Order Approving Extension of Power Rates on an Interim Basis
 


August 29, 1994.
 


Pursuant to Sections 302(a) and 301(b) of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Public Law 95-91, the functions
of the Secretary of the Interior and the Federal Power Commission under Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16
U.S.C. 825s, for the Southwestern Power Administration were transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Energy.
By Delegation Order 
No. 0204-108, effective December 14, 1983, 48 FR 55664, the Secretary of Energy delegated to the Deputy Secretary
of Energy on a non-exclusive basis the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power
and transmission rates, and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on an exclusive basis the
authority to confirm, approve and place in effect on a final basis, or to disapprove power and transmission rates.
Amendment No. 1 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective May 30, 1986, 51 FR 19744, revised the delegation
of authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and transmission rates by delegating
such authority to the Under Secretary of Energy rather than the Deputy Secretary of Energy. This delegation was reassigned
to the Deputy Secretary of Energy by Department of Energy (DOE) Notice 1110.29, dated October 27, 1988, and clarified
by Secretary of Energy Notice SEN-10-89, dated August 3, 1989, and subsequent revisions. By Amendment
No. 2 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective August 23, 1991, 56 FR 41835, the Secretary of the Department
of Energy revised Delegation Order No. 0204-108 to delegate to the Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable
Energy, the authority which was previously delegated to the Deputy Secretary in that Delegation Order. By Amendment
No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective November 10, 1993, the Secretary of Energy redelegated to
the Deputy Secretary of Energy, the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power and
transmission rates of the Power Marketing Administrations. This rate order is issued by the Deputy Secretary pursuant
to said Amendment to Delegation Order No. 0204-108.


This is an interim rate extension. It is made pursuant to the authorities as implemented in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a).




Background



Southwestern Power Administration (Southwestern) currently has marketing responsibility for 2.2 million kilowatts
of power from 24 multiple-purpose reservoir projects, with power facilities constructed and operated by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, generally in all or portions of the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas. The Integrated System, composed of 22 of the projects, is interconnected through a transmission system
presently consisting of 138- and 161-kV high-voltage transmission lines, 69-kV transmission lines, and numerous
bulk power substations and switching stations. In addition, contractual transmission arrangements provide for
integration of other projects into the system. 

The remaining two projects, Sam Rayburn Dam and Robert Douglas Willis, are isolated hydraulically and electrically
from the Southwestern transmission system, and their power is marketed under separate contracts through which the
customer purchases the entire power output of the project at the dam. A separate Power Repayment Study (PRS) is prepared
for each isolated project, and each has a special rate which is not a part of this study. The existing rate schedules
for the Integrated System were confirmed and approved on a final basis by the FERC on September 18, 1991 for the period
October 1, 1990 through September 30, 1994. The FY 1994 Integrated System 
PRSs indicate the need for a minor rate adjustment of $726,051 annually, or 0.8 percent.

Pursuant to implementing authority in 10 CFR 903(h) and 903.23(a), the Deputy Secretary of Energy may extend a FERC-approved
rate on an interim basis. The Administrator, Southwestern, published notice in the 

Federal Register

 on June 14, 1994, 59 FR 30583, announcing a 15-day period for public review and comment concerning the proposed interim
rate extension. In addition, informal meetings were held with customer representatives on January 12, 1994; April
4, 1994; and May 6, 1994. Written comments were accepted through June 29, 1994. No comments on the proposed interim
extension were received.



Discussion



The existing Integrated System rates are based on the FY 1990 PRS. PRSs have been completed on the Integrated System
each year since approval of the existing rates. Rate changes indicated by the PRSs during that period indicated the
need for a minor rate increase or decrease. Since the revenue changes reflected by the PRSs were within the plus-or-minus
two percent Rate Adjustment Threshold established by Southwestern's Administrator on June 23, 1987, these rate
adjustments were deferred in the best interest of the government and provided for the next year's PRS to determine
the appropriate level of revenues needed for the next rate period. 

The FY 1994 PRS indicates the need for a minor rate increase of 0.8 percent. As has been the case since the existing rates
were approved, the FY 1994 rate adjustment needed falls within Southwestern's plus-or-minus two percent Rate Adjustment
Threshold and would normally be deferred. However, the existing rates expire on September 30, 1994. Consequently,
Southwestern proposes to extend the existing rates for a one-year period ending September 30, 1995, on an interim
basis under the implementation authorities noted in 10 CFR 903.22(h) and 903.23(a). 

Southwestern continues to make significant progress toward repayment of the Federal investment in the Integrated
System. Through FY 1993, status of repayment for the Integrated System was $288,259,891, which represents approximately
30 percent of the $971,634,103 Federal investment for the Integrated System. The status has increased almost 47 percent
since the existing rates were placed in effect. 

Information regarding this rate extension, including studies and other supporting material, is available for public
review and comment in the offices of Southwestern Power Administration, One West Third Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101.




Order



In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Secretary of Energy, I hereby extend on
an interim basis, for the period of one year, effective October 1, 1994, the current FERC-approved Integrated System
Rates for the sale of power and energy.

Part I 


A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements 


Existing Sources and New Dischargers.
1. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and 
lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is authorized 
to discharge treated groundwater and storm water that has been 
contaminated by Automotive Gasoline. It is anticipated that these 
contaminated waters will be treated by air stripping, followed by 
activated carbon adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment 
to meet the following effluent limitations. 
Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as 
specified below: 




An LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a violation of Florida Administrative Code (FAC)

(July 11, 1993)  17-4.244(3)(a) and the terms of this permit. The 
testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. 
For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the effluent shall 
not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 
6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 units, unless the 
permittee submits natural background data in the NOI request 
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If 
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 units in marine 
waters, the pH shall not vary below natural background or vary more 
than one (1) unit above natural background for fresh and coastal 
waters. If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed 
by sampling data from the permittee in the NOI request, is 
determined to be higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above 
natural background or vary more than one (1) unit below natural 
background of fresh and coastal waters. The acceptable pH range 
will be included in the letter granting permit coverage and on the 
DMR. The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or 
continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
In accordance with FAC  17-302.500(1)(a-c)(4-25-93), the discharge 
shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, 
turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on 
surface waters. 
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements 
specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): 
Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual 
discharge or mixing with the receiving waters.

A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements 


Existing Sources and New Dischargers.
2. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit 
and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is 
authorized to discharge treated groundwater and storm water 
that has been contaminated by Aviation Gasoline, Jet Fuel or 
Diesel. 
It is anticipated that these contaminated waters will be 
treated by air stripping, followed by activated carbon 
adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment to meet the 
following effluent limitations. Such discharges shall be 
limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: 




An LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a violation of FAC (July 11, 1993)  17-4.244(3)(a)
and the terms of this permit. The testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. 
The permittee shall comply with the same pH requirements for this Part I.A.2 as in Part I.A.1. 

The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
In accordance with FAC  17-302.500(1)(a-c), the discharge shall at all times be free from floating solids,
visible foam, turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on surface waters. 
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements specified above shall be taken at the following location(s):
Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual discharge or mixing with the receiving waters.



A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements


3. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee
is authorized to discharge produced groundwater from any noncontaminated site activity which discharges by a point
source to waters of the United States, only if the reported values for the parameters listed below do not exceed any
of the screening values below. Before discharge of produced groundwater can occur from such sites, analytical tests
on samples of the proposed discharge water shall be performed to determine if contamination exists from other sources.


Minimum reporting requirements for all produced groundwater dischargers. 
The effluent shall be sampled at the final effluent before the commencement of discharge and once every six months
for the life of the project to maintain continued coverage under this general permit. The effluent shall be sampled
for the parameters listed below and the analytical results obtained shall be submitted to EPA at the address given
in Part III.A. 





Reported analytical test results for the parameters listed above exceeding any of the screening values listed below
shall be considered an indication of contamination from sources other than petroleum fuels: 





If any of the analytical test results exceed the above screening values, discharge is not authorized by this permit.
See paragraph I.A.3.b for further guidance. 
In accordance with FAC 17-302.500(1)(a-c), the discharge shall at all times be free from floating solids,
visible foam, turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on surface waters.

All discharges must comply with the following permit requirements: 
(a) If analytical tests of Part I.A.3 reveal excessive benzene and naphthalene concentrations indicative of contamination
from petroleum fuels, and the discharge will occur for thirty (30) days or less, the permittee shall comply only with
the applicable effluent limitations and monitoring requirements in Part I.A.1 or I.A.2 for benzene, pH, and/or naphthalene
and total lead. The commencement of the Part V biomonitoring program and Part I.B.3 EPA method 624 and 625 (one time
analysis) is not required for this short-term activity. One (1) grab sample shall be analyzed per seven (7) days during
the discharge period, and the total volume discharged shall be recorded. For discharges contaminated by petroleum
fuels that last for less than a week, daily monitoring will be required for the applicable parameters. Upon receipt
of written EPA notification of coverage that the NOI request is complete, these short-term discharges may commence.
Discharge Monitoring Reports shall be submitted to EPA within thirty (30) days after termination of the discharge.

(b) If contamination from sources other than petroleum contamination does exist, as indicated by the results of the
analytical tests required by Part I. A.3 above, the discharge is not covered by this general permit. The operator shall
apply for an individual NPDES permit at least ninety (120) days prior to the date a discharge to waters of the United
States is expected. No discharge is permissible without an effective NPDES permit. 
(c) If analytical tests reveal no contamination exists from petroleum fuels or sources other than petroleum contamination
as a result of the required analytical screening tests required in Part I, A.3, the permittee can commence discharge
immediately and is covered by this permit without having to submit an NOI request for coverage to EPA, Region IV. A short
summary of the proposed activity and copy of these analytical tests shall be sent to the same address specified in Part
III.A at least (1) one week before discharge begins. These analytical tests shall be kept on site during discharge
and made available to EPA, if requested. Additionally, no Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) forms are required to
be submitted to EPA, Region IV. 



B. Other Requirements 


1. Any more frequent effluent discharge monitoring required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) for the parameters limited in this permit, or different parameters, shall be reported to the Permit Issuing
Authority in accordance with the requirements of Part III of this permit. 
2. Effluent limitations for combining contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated
groundwater from the site's recovery wells: The permittee shall notify FDEP of any intent to combine contaminated
groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated groundwater from the recovery well. Approval
of this combined effluent discharge by FDEP will constitute approval to apply for coverage under this permit. 
3. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this permit or startup of discharge the permittee shall also submit
the results of the following analyses. These analyses shall be performed on a representative sample of the groundwater
effluent discharge, taken after final treatment. 
Required analyses (one time only): 




a. EPA Method 625_Acid and base/neutral extractable organics 
b. EPA Method 624_Purgeable Organics




If such analyses required in Part B.3 above reveal toxic pollutants other than those regulated in Part I.A. or subsequent
Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests reveal an LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less, coverage under this general permit will be reviewed for termination
by EPA Region IV Enforcement Section. 
4. If the pH is monitored continuously, the pH values shall not deviate outside the required range more than 1% of the
time in any calendar month; and no individual excursion shall exceed 60 minutes. An ``excursion'' is an unintentional
and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge wastewater exceeds the range set forth in this permit. 


C. Test Procedures 


1. In performing the analysis for the dissolved constituents in the surface water and groundwater, the permittee
shall use the guidelines recommended and described in FAC Sections 17-770.600(8)[a-d] of the Petroleum

2. If the petroleum contamination is from a petroleum fuel in 
which the source of contamination has not been identified, 
the groundwater shall be analyzed (using the recommended 
methods) for the following parameters as described in FAC 
Section 17.770.600(8)(c)1, of the PCCC, amended 
February 20, 1990, or the most current edition: 






D. Schedule of Compliance 


1. The permittee shall achieve compliance with the effluent 
limitations specified for discharges in accordance with the following 
schedule: 



Permittees with Revoked Individual Permits: 


Operational level attained_Upon Receipt of Notification of Coverage 


New Dischargers: 


Operational level attained_Upon Commencement of Discharge



2. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days after any date 
identified in the above schedule of compliance the permittee shall 
submit either a report of progress or, in the case of specific actions 
being required by identified dates, a written notice of compliance or 
noncompliance. In the latter case, the notice shall include the cause 
of noncompliance, any remedial actions taken, and the probability of 
meeting the next scheduled requirement. 


Part II 
Standard Conditions for NPDES Permits 


Section A. General Conditions 


1. Duty To Comply 


The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any 
permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act 
and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, 
revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit 
renewal application. 


2. Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions 


Any person who violates a permit condition is subject to a civil 
penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of such violation. Any person 
who willfully or negligently violates permit conditions is subject to 
a fine of up to $50,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for 
not more than 1 year, or both. Any person who knowingly violates 
permit conditions is subject to criminal penalties of $5,000 to 
50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 
years, or both. Also, any person who violates a permit condition may 
be assessed an administrative penalty not to exceed $10,000 per 
violation with the maximum not to exceed $125,000. [Ref: CFR 
122.41(a)]. 


3. Duty To Mitigate 


The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent 
any discharge in violation of this permit which has a reasonable 
likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment. 



4. Duty To Reapply 


Where EPA is the Permit Issuing Authority (PIA), the terms and 
conditions of this permit are automatically continued in accordance 
with 40 CFR 122.6, only where the permittee has submitted a timely 
and complete Notice of Intent 180 days prior to expiration of this 
permit, and the PIA is unable through no fault of the permittee to 
issue a new permit before the expiration date. 


5. Permit Modification 


After notice and opportunity for a hearing, this permit may be 
modified, terminated, or revoked for cause (as described in 40 CFR 
122.62 et seq.) including, but not limited to, the following: 
a. Violation of any terms or conditions of this permit; 
b. Obtaining this permit by misrepresentation or failure to 
disclose fully all relevant facts; 
c. A change in any conditions that requires either temporary 
interruption or elimination of the permitted discharge; or 
d. Information newly acquired by the Agency indicating the 
discharge poses a threat to human health or welfare. 
If the permittee believes that any past or planned activity would be 
cause for modification or revocation and reissuance under 40 CFR 
122.62, the permittee must report such information to the Permit 
Issuing Authority. The submittal of a new application may be 
required of the permittee. The filing of a request by the permittee 
for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, 
or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, 
does not stay any permit condition. 


6. Toxic Pollutants 


Notwithstanding Paragraph A-4, above, if a toxic effluent standard or 
prohibition (including any schedule of compliance specified in such 
effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) 
of the Act for a toxic pollutant which is present in the discharge 
and such standard or prohibition is more stringent than any 
limitation for such pollutant in this permit, this permit shall be 
modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the toxic effluent 
standard or prohibition and the permittee so notified. 


7. Civil and Criminal Liability 


Except as provided in permit conditions on ``Bypassing'' Section B, 
Paragraph B-3, nothing in this permit shall be construed to relieve 
the permittee from civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. 


8. Oil and Hazardous Substance Liability 


Nothing in this permit shall be construed to preclude the institution 
of any legal action or relieve the permittee from any

responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties established pursuant to 
any applicable State law or regulation under authority preserved by 
Section 510 of the Act. 


10. Property Rights 


The issuance of this permit does not convey any property rights of 
any sort, or any exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any 
injury to private property or any invasion of personal rights, nor 
any infringement of Federal, State or local laws or regulations. 


11. Severability 


The provisions of this permit are severable, and if any provision of 
this permit, or the application of any provision of this permit to 
any circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such provision 
to other circumstances, and the remainder of this permit, shall not 
be affected thereby. 


12. Duty to Provide Information 


The permittee shall furnish to the Permit Issuing Authority, within a 
reasonable time, any information which the Permit Issuing Authority 
may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking 
and reissuing, or terminating this permit or to determine compliance 
with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Permit 
Issuing Authority upon request, copies of records required to be kept 
by this permit. 


Section B. Operation and Maintenance of Pollution Controls 


1. Proper Operation and Maintenance 


The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all 
facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related 
appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to 
achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper 
operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls 
and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision 
requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar 
systems which are installed by a permittee only when the operation is 
necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. 


2. Need to Halt or Reduce not a Defense 


It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action 
that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted 
activity in order to maintain compliance with the condition of this 
permit. 


3. Bypass of Treatment Facilities 


a. Definitions 
(1) 

Bypass

 means the intentional diversion of waste streams 
from any portion of a treatment facility, which is not a 
designed or established operating mode for the facility. 

(2) 

Severe property damage

 means substantial physical damage 
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes 
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss 
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to 
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage 
does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
b. Bypass not exceeding limitations. 
The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not 
cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it 
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions 
of Paragraphs c. and d. of this section. 
c. Notice 
(1) Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance 
of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, 
if possible at least ten days before the date of the 
bypass; including an evaluation of the anticipated 
quality and effect of the bypass. 
(2) Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit 
notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in 
Section D, Paragraph D-4 (24-hour notice). 
d. Prohibition of bypass. 
(1) Bypass is prohibited and the Permit Issuing Authority 
may take enforcement action against a permittee for 
bypass, unless: 
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, 
personal injury, or severe and extensive property 
damage; 
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, 
such as maintenance of sufficient reserve holding 
capacity, the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, waste 
hauling, or maintenance during normal periods of 
equipment downtime. This condition is not 
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should 
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable 
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which 
occurred during normal periods of equipment 
downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c) The permittee submitted notices as required under 
Paragraph c. of this section. 
(2) The Permit Issuing Authority may, within its authority, 
approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its 
adverse effects, if the Permit Issuing Authority 
determines that it will meet the three conditions 
listed above in Paragraph d.(1) of this section.

4. Upsets 


``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is 
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based 
permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the control 
of the permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the 
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment 
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive 
maintenance, or careless or improper operation. An upset 
constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for 
noncompliance with such technology based permit limitation if the 
requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(n)(3) are met. (Note that this 
provision does not apply to water quality requirements.) 


5. Removed Substances 


This permit does not authorize discharge of solids, sludge, 
filter backwash, or other pollutants removed in the course of 
treatment or control of wastewaters to waters of the United 
States unless specifically limited in Part 1. 


Section C. Monitoring and Records 


1. Representative Sampling 


Samples and measurements taken as required herein shall be 
representative of the volume and nature of the monitored discharge. 
All samples shall be taken at the monitoring points specified in this 
permit and, unless otherwise specified, before the effluent joins or is 
diluted by any other wastestream, body of water, or substance. 
Monitoring points shall not be changed without notification to and the 
approval of the Permit Issuing Authority. 


2. Flow Measurements 


Appropriate flow measurement devices and methods consistent with accepted 
scientific practices shall be selected and used to insure the accuracy and 
reliability of measurements of the volume of monitored discharges. The 
devices shall be installed, calibrated and maintained to insure that the 
accuracy of the measurements are consistent with the accepted capability 
of that type of device. Devices selected shall be capable of measuring 
flows with a maximum deviation of less than 

#

 10% from the true discharge 
rates throughout the range of expected discharge volumes. Guidance in 
selection, installation, calibration and operation of acceptable flow 
measurement devices can be obtained from the following references:

Section E. Definitions 



1. Permit Issuing Authority 



The Regional Administrator of EPA Region IV or his designee, unless 
at some time in the future the State receives the authority to 
administer the NPDES program and assumes jurisdiction over the 
permit; at which time, the Director of the State program receiving 
authorization becomes the issuing authority. 



2. Act 





Act 

means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act) Public Law 92-500, as amended by Public 
Laws 95-217, 95-576, 96-483,97-117, and Public Law 100-4, 33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq. 



3. Concentration Measurements 



a. The ``average monthly concentration'', is the sum of the 
concentrations of all daily discharges sampled and/or 
measured during a calendar month on which daily discharges 
are sampled and measured, divided by the number of daily 
discharges sampled and/or measured during such 
month (arithmetic mean of the daily concentration values). 
The daily concentration value is equal to the concentration 
of a composite sample or in the case of grab samples is the 
arithmetic mean (weighted by flow value) of all the samples 
collected during the calendar day. 

b. The ``maximum daily concentration'', is the concentration of 
a pollutant discharge during a calendar day. It is 
identified as ``Daily Maximum'' under ``Other Limits'' in Part 
I of the permit and the highest such value recorded during 
the reporting period is reported under the ``Maximum'' column 
under ``Quality'' on the DMR. 



4. Other Measurements 



a. The effluent flow expressed as MGD is the 24 hour average 
flow averaged monthly. It is the arithmetic mean of the 
total daily flows recorded during the calendar month. 
Where monitoring requirements for flow are specified in 
Part I of the permit the flow rate values are reported in 
the ``Average'' column under ``Quantity'' on the DMR.

b. An ``instantaneous flow measurement'' is a measure of flow 
taken at the time of sampling, when both the sample and 
flow will be representative of the total discharge. 

c. Where monitoring requirements for pH or dissolved oxygen 
are specified in Part I of the permit, the values are 
generally reported in the ``Quality or Concentration'' column 
on the DMR. 



5. Types of Samples 



a. Grab Sample: A ``grab sample'' is a single influent or 
effluent portion which is not a composite sample. The 
sample(s) shall be collected at the period(s) most 
representative of the total discharge. 



6. Calendar Day 



A calendar day is defined as the period from midnight of one day 
until midnight of the next day. However, for purposes of this 
permit, any consecutive 24-hour period that reasonably 
represents the calendar day may be used for sampling. 



7. Hazardous Substance 



A hazardous substance means any substance designated under 40 
CFR Part 116 pursuant to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. 



8. Toxic Pollutant 



A toxic pollutant is any pollutant listed as toxic under Section 
307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act. 



Section F. Application Requirements 



a. For expired individual NPDES permits, dischargers desiring 
coverage under this general permit are required to submit a notice

include (1) The name and address of the person that the permit 
will be issued to (2) the name, and address of the operation, 
including county location, (3) the applicable individual NPDES 
number(s), (4) the identification of any new discharge location 
not contained in the expired permit, (5) evidence that the 
operation has obtained approval of a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) 
Order from the FDEP, (6) a map showing the facility and discharge 
location (including latitude and longitude), and (7) the name of 
the receiving water. Operators having several individual permits 
are encouraged to consolidate requests for coverage into one NOI 
for all individual permits. The previous submission of the proper 
forms in the renewal application does not relieve the permittee 
desiring coverage under the general permit of the requirement to 
file a NOI. 

b. Dischargers with current individual NPDES permits that desire 
coverage under this general permit are required to file an NOI to 
the Permit Issuing Authority at least thirty (30) days prior to 
expiration of their current permit(s). The NOI shall contain the 
same information specified in paragraph a above. Permittees 
desiring to renew their individual permit are required to submit 
the appropriate application forms at least 180 days before 
expiration of their individual permit. 

c. Dischargers who have not previously obtained an individual NPDES 
permit are required to submit to EPA the FDEP approval order letter 
approving the site RAP. The RAP approval order shall be attached 
to an NOI to be covered by the general permit and shall contain the 
same information specified in paragraph a above. The application 
for coverage under the general permit must be made at least 
forty-five (45) days before the discharge is to commence. 

d. Dischargers seeking coverage under Part I A.3.a. will be required 
to submit to EPA the date the discharge is expected to cease, 
results of analytical data and the same information in paragraph a 
above, except items (3), (4) and (5). Notification of coverage to 
discharge will be upon receipt of EPA's short-term coverage letter. 

e. Notification of coverage will be given by the Permit 
Issuing Authority by certified mail to the permittee, for 
dischargers seeking coverage under Part I Sections A.1 and A.2, 
with the issuance date for each facility being the effective date 
of coverage by the Permit Issuing Authority. 

f. Dischargers meeting the conditions set forth in Part I A.3.c. are 
not required to submit an detailed NOI as outlined above, but must 
submit a copy of the analytical tests and a summary of the proposed 
activity at least one (1) week before discharge begins. These 
dischargers are covered upon receipt of the data, unless notified 
otherwise by EPA. 

g. The coverage of the permit shall expire on 

XXXXXX

, five (5) years from the effective date of the permit. 

h. In accordance with 40 CFR 122.28(a)(2) permittees who are covered 
by this general permit who seek to be continued under this general 
permit, shall submit an complete NOI in accordance with paragraph a, to EPA 180 days before the expiration of this permit.

(b) Methods currently being deployed at the site to 

prevent 

groundwater contamination from reoccurring. 

(c) Other alternative treatment options which were considered in 

reducing 

the groundwater contamination. 

(d) Explanation of why long term treatment of discharge to Surface Waters of the United States was chosen as opposed
to: 

(1) 

Reduction-Monitor Phase I_

Using a combination of techniques to significantly reduce groundwater contamination that could be achieved in three
(3) months or less, with the objective of reaching a 

monitor-only 

status. 

(2) 

Reduction-Monitor Phase II_

Using a combination of techniques to significantly reduce groundwater contamination that could be achieved in six
(6) months or less, with the objective of reaching a 

monitor-only 

status. 

In an effort to promote pollution prevention, the Permit Issuing Authority may issue permits which include or require
pollution prevention activities. 



Part V 



Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Program Acute Freshwater Language 



As required by Part I of the permit, within 30-days after commencement of discharge, permittees discharging to fresh
waters, which are surface waters in which the chloride concentration at the surface is less than 1500 milligrams per
liter, shall initiate the series of tests described below to evaluate whole effluent toxicity of the discharge from
the outfall. If more than one (1) outfall exists, separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test species,
procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be in accordance with 

Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms, 

EPA/600/4-90/027F, or the most current edition. The dilution/control water used will be moderately hard water
as described in EPA/600/4-90/027F, Section 7, or the most current edition. A standard reference toxicant quality
assurance test shall be conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity tests and the results submitted
with the discharge monitoring report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant tests are conducted,
these results must be submitted with the DMR. 

1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal multi-concentration toxicity tests using the daphnid
(

Ceriodaphnia dubia

) and the fathead minnow (

Pimephales promelas

). All tests shall be conducted on one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall be conducted on a control (0%)
and the following dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. 

b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in any test, the test(s) for that species (including the control)
shall be repeated. A test will be considered valid only if control mortality does not exceed 10% for either species.


2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once every month until three (3) valid monthly tests have
been completed, and once every year thereafter for the duration of the permit, unless notified otherwise by the permit
issuing authority. These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 

3. a. If unacceptable acute toxicity (an LC

50

 of 100% or less occurs in either test species in any of the above-described tests within the specified time) is found
in a ``routine'' test, the permittee shall conduct two additional acute toxicity tests in the same manner as the ``routine''
test on the specie(s) indicating unacceptable acute toxicity. For each additional test, the sample collection requirements
and test acceptability criteria specified in Section 1 above must be met for the test to be considered valid. The first
test shall begin within two weeks of the end of the ``routine'' tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter until
two additional, valid tests are completed. The additional tests will be used to determine if the toxicity found in
the ``routine'' test is still present. 

b. Results from additional tests, required due to unacceptable acute toxicity in the ``routine'' test(s), must be


reported 

on the Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Form for the month in which the test was begun. Such test results must be 

submitted 

within 45 days of completion of the second additional, valid test.

3. Background



The adoption of the State Underground Petroleum Environmental 
Response (SUPER) Act of 1986 set standard procedures for the State 
of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and 
their Division of Waste Management's Bureau of Waste Cleanup to 
regulate during cleanup processes undertaken at all petroleum 
contamination sites. The SUPER Act was amended on 
February 20, 1990, and is currently referred to as Chapter 17-770, 
Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria. 

Chapter 17-770 gives the FDEP authority over cleanup operations 
for areas which have been contaminated by fuels from petroleum 
storage systems. Chapter 17-770 also provides guidance for 
permittees in preparing initial remedial actions (IRA's), 
contamination assessment reports (CAR's), and remedial action 
plans (RAP's) while assessing and delineating areas where 
suspected petroleum contamination has occurred. In order to 
facilitate the authorization process for the potentially large 
number of permittees who would be required to discharge treated 
groundwater to surface waters of Florida, the FDEP requested that 
an NPDES general permit be issued to cover these facilities in 
Florida. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after 
proposing a draft permit on August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), issued 
a final NPDES general permit on July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), to 
cover the facilities and similar types of discharges associated 
with them. This NPDES General Permit was modified on 
August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), to address general dewatering for 
uncontaminated discharges of produced groundwater and short term 
discharges from facilities with treated groundwater. This 
modification also changed the number of the permit from FLG040001 to FLG830000. 

As of June, 1994, EPA has authorized over 350 facilities to 
discharge under the general permit, and the FDEP estimates that 
there are over 20,000 facilities that have reported suspected 
petroleum leaks throughout the State of Florida. The current 
permit FLG83000 expired on July 16, 1994, and numerous 
facilities are either discharging under this permit or 
submitting Notices of Intent for coverage under this general 
permit. Therefore, EPA Region IV is proposing to reissue the 
NPDES General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities in the State of 
Florida to assist in permitting these types of activities. The 
requirements for those facilities that were covered by the 
current NPDES General Permit before July 16, 1994, will be 
continued in force until reissuance of this general permit 
occurs. However, once reissuance occurs, all facilities 
covered by this permit will be required to submit a NOI 
requesting continued coverage under the reissued general permit 
within sixty (60) days after reissuance of the general permit. 
Permittees submitting NOI's after July 17, 1994, will not be 
provided with a notification of coverage under the general 
permit. These facilities will not be allowed to discharge until 
the date which the reissued NPDES General Permit, FLG830000, 
becomes effective, or until an individual permit is issued to 
the facility.

4. General Information for This Florida General Permit 


This general permit places limitations on discharges from 
treatment systems which are used to treat common contaminants 
found in petroleum fuels and allows the permittee to expedite 
startup of a hydrocarbon recovery system once a leak has been 
detected and groundwater has been contaminated. The general 
permit also allows general dewatering for uncontaminated sites. 
Normally, such a recovery system consists of monitoring wells 
that are used for sampling and delineating plume movement. 
Recovery wells, which may be vertical or horizontal, are used to 
recover contaminated groundwater in the impacted area. The 
placement of recovery wells is generally determined after 
consideration of geologic conditions and groundwater movement in 
order to maximize recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons. The rate 
of movement by the contaminants is affected by the varying 
permeability and adsorptive characteristics of the water-filled 
pore spaces and depth of the water table. After the 
contamination reaches the water table, the free-floating 
contaminant is usually pumped from the recovery wells to an 
above ground storage tank. Additionally, vapor recovery systems 
are often used to remove volatiles from the soil. The dissolved 
organics in the contaminated water are pumped to an air stripper 
and treated using packed-tower aeration and, when necessary, 
carbon adsorption. Both of these treatment processes have 
proven effective in removing up to 99% of the volatile compounds 
before discharge into surface waters. 
The Florida FDEP and EPA Region IV estimates that of the sites 
for which a RAP is prepared in any given year, a maximum of 100 
facilities may propose discharge to surface water under this 
general permit. In order to allow hydrocarbon recovery 
operations to be performed without processing individual 
applications for permit issuance, EPA proposes to reissue this 
general permit to sources identified within the political 
boundaries of the State of Florida. 
This general permit may be used to authorize discharges of 
treated groundwater and storm water incidental to groundwater 
cleanup operations. Long term cleanups, over thirty (30) days, 
must have an approved remedial action plan (RAP) before 
submitting a NOI to discharge under this NPDES General permit. 
The RAP Approval Order must be submitted with the applicant's 
NOI and is required before authorizing cleanups over thirty (30) 
days. This permit is not limited to cleanup operations funded 
by the State of Florida, but may cover all such cleanup 
operations if the NOI requirements are satisfied. 


5. Basis for Final Effluent Limits and Permit Conditions 


The effluent limits for the general permit are based on 
treatment technology data obtained from previous individual 
application requests. The general permit has been written to 
require an effluent limit on three (3) chemicals, i.e., benzene, 
naphthalene and lead. 
Benzene is a potential carcinogen according to EPA 440/5-80-0180 
and Florida has adopted a WQS for this parameter. However, the 
previous technology-based effluent limit of 1.0 

m

g/l is more 
stringent than Florida's water quality standard of 71.28 

m

g/l at 
(FAC 17-302.530(9)), dated April 25, 1993; therefore, the more 
stringent technology based limit, which is also protective of 
water quality, will be included in the reissued permit. 
Based on the ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Benzene,'' this 
maximum contaminant level for benzene is well below the 10

^6

 
risk factor of 40 

m

g/l for consumption of contaminated aquatic 
organisms. This limit of 1.0 

m

g/l is also between the 10

^5

 risk factor of 6.6 

m

g/l and 10

^6

 risk factor of .66 

m

g/l for 
consumption of contaminated water and aquatic organisms. 
Most facilities have been able to meet the technology based 
effluent limit for lead of 30 

m

g/l, which is required since 
older gasoline sites may have marketed fuels with leaded 
compounds added in the form of tetraethyllead. Based on the 
``Ambient Water Quality Document for Lead,'' this limit is well 
below the current human health standard of 50 

m

g/l, which is 
protective of human health against the ingestion of contaminated 
water and contaminated aquatic organisms (EPA 440/5-80-057). 
The naphthalene limit of 100 

m

g/l was developed based on FDEP 
petroleum contamination site cleanup criteria 
(17-770.730(5)(a)2e), amended February 20, 1990. According to 
the ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Naphthalene,'' acute and 
chronic toxicity to freshwater aquatic life occurs at 
concentrations as low as 2300 

m

g/l for the Rainbow Trout and 
620 

m

g/l for the Fathead Minnow and would occur at lower 
concentrations among species that are more sensitive than those 
tested. Also, according to the ``Handbook of Environmental Data 
and Organic Chemicals,'' tainting of fish flesh occurs for 
naphthalene near 1000 

m

g/l. The petroleum site criteria limit of 
100 

m

g/l for naphthalene is more stringent than EPA's water quality 
document for this parameter and should provide adequate protection 
for more sensitive aquatic organisms. 
The pH requirements were established based on water quality criteria 
at Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 17-303.530(52)(c), dated 
April 25, 1993. For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the 
effluent shall not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh 
waters, or less than 6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 
units, unless the permittee submits data during the NOI request 
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If the 
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
than 6.0 standard units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 standard 
units in marine waters, the pH shall not vary below natural 
background or vary more than one (1) unit above natural background. 
If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be 
higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above natural background 
or vary more than one (1) unit below natural background. The 
continuous monitoring for pH is an option granted to the permittee 
and is based on  401.17 of the Clean Water Act. 
The permittee may request an individual permit to seek less stringent 
end-of-pipe effluent limitations for benzene, total lead, and 
naphthalene dependent upon resulting instream concentrations during 
critical low flows of the receiving stream.

The groundwater reporting requirements for the parameters: TOC, pH, 
the Total Recoverable Metals which include Mercury, Cadmium, Copper, 
Lead, Zinc, Chromium (Hexavalent), Benzene and Naphthalene, to 
determine if contamination exists from other sources are based on 
Section 308(a) of the Clean Water Act. The screening values for TOC, 
Benzene, and Naphthalene are based on the final August 29, 1991, 
modification (56 FR 42739) and the standards for total recoverable 
metals are based on the most current Florida Water Quality Standards 
for total recoverable metals at FAC Section 17-302.530 [4-25-93]. 
As with any petroleum fuel, other aromatic compounds will be present 
once testing has occurred. Other volatiles will be present in 
untreated groundwater in greater concentrations than benzene. Past 
experience in treatment design has shown that these organics can be 
effectively treated before discharging to surface waters. According 
to the ``Toxicant Profile for the ALKYL BENZENES,'' (Ethylbenzene, 
Isopropylbenzene, Toluene, Xylene) prepared for Florida's DEP by the 
Center of Biomedical and Toxicological Research at Florida State 
University, levels for these ALKYL BENZENES of 100-200 

m

g/l were 
recommended for the protection of aquatic organisms and human health. 
These recommendations are below EPA's ``Ambient Water Quality 
Criteria'' documents recommendation for human health which suggest 
levels of 1400 

m

g/l to 14300 

m

g/l for Ethylbenzene and Toluene. 
The recommended treatment technology of air stripping and, when 
necessary, carbon adsorption, will reduce the benzene concentration 
to below 1.0 

m

g/l. Therefore, EPA will not impose specific limits on 
the other pollutants which may occur since meeting the limits set in 
this permit should reduce the other pollutants well below those 
levels allowable based on Florida's water quality standards. 
Also, the effluent shall not be lethal to more than 50% of 
appropriate fish or invertebrate test organism in a 96-hour static 
renewal test. Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) monitoring tests 
performed by six (6) facilities between May 8, 1991 thru March, 1994 
indicated that these effluents were toxic and, therefore, have the 
reasonable potential to violate Florida's water quality standards at 
FAC Section 17-4.244(3)(a). Because previous 48-hour static WET 
monitoring tests have revealed that these effluents have the 
potential of being toxic, toxicity testing requirements as authorized 
and required by 40 CFR Section 122.44(d)(1)(iv), and contained in 
Part I, A.1 and A.2 and in Part V have been included to ensure that 
the effluent from these facilities conforms with the FAC. An LC

50

 of 
100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will constitute a 
violation of FAC (February 2, 1994) Section 17-4.244(3)(a) and the 
terms of this permit. 
Since the recovery wells in most instances are placed in areas of 
highest contamination, it is reasonable to conclude that the greatest 
potential for toxicity should occur during the initial startup stages 
of operation. Therefore, an initial frequency of once every month 
for three (3) months is included in these requirements to indicate 
toxicity and determine treatment performance of these facilities 
immediately after commencement of discharge. If no toxicity is 
confirmed, the frequency is then reduced to yearly since the 
permittee will be required to meet effluent limitations and the 
potential for toxicity is at a minimum. Failure to demonstrate 
compliance with the acute toxicity requirement will constitute a 
violation of the terms of the permit. 
The sample type for all biomonitoring is ``Grab'' in accordance with 
Part V of this general permit. 
The permittee is required to develop and implement a Best Management 
Practices (BMPs) plan in conjunction with development of the Remedial 
Action Plan required by FDEP. BMPs are actions or procedures to 
prevent or minimize the potential for the release of toxic pollutants 
or hazardous substances in significant amounts to surface waters. Additionally, for long term cleanups, the permittee
shall develop a 
Pollution Prevention Plan which considers alternatives for preventing 
and reducing impacts to surface waters in accordance with Part IV. 
A.2 of this permit. 


6. Treatment Technology 


According to EPA's publication entitled ``Treatment of Volatile 
Organic Compounds in Drinking Water,'' a drinking water research 
experiment was conducted on spiked water using one organic volatile 
and then by combining two volatiles. The experiment used aeration as 
the treatment process. It was discovered that no difference was 
observed in treatment efficiency when applying aeration to one 
organic chemical or a combination of volatiles. In this particular 
experiment an overall efficiency of 92% was obtained. Most petroleum 
fuels consist of a combination of volatiles and aromatics, each 
different, based on additives included during refining of the fuel. 
In case studies revealed in the Environmental Science and 
Engineering's document ESE No. 84-912-0300, packed tower aeration 
utilizing different packing materials, varying flow paths and 
air-to-water ratios have been proven effective in removing over 99% 
of the volatiles. Some particular compounds are not as easily 
air-stripped as others which would necessitate the need for a 
combination treatment design used in conjunction with aeration. 
Carbon adsorption has been proven effective in removing organics from 
water until the influent concentration is in equilibrium with the 
effluent and the organics no longer adhere to the carbon surface. 
Adsorption has been used successfully in removing less volatile 
compounds of higher molecular weight. Other remediation techniques 
currently being deployed include vapor recovery systems and 
bioremediation which enhances biological activity. 
According to (EPA 570/9-84-005) entitled ``Adsorption Techniques in 
Drinking Water Treatment'' the efficiency of carbon adsorption was 
proven effective during a case study in Hialeah, Florida at the 
Preston water treatment plant. In this study, groundwater from a 
drinking water aquifer was spiked with higher molecular weight 
extractables before treating the water with granular activated 
carbon. It was found that more than 90% removal of the spiked 
compounds was obtained. The combination of air-stripping with 
adsorption usually extends the adsorptive life of the 
activated carbon and leads to more efficient treatment, but is not 
always required or recommended in every situation.

International Call-Back Services



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of solicitation of public comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Communications Commission has expanded the scope of the issues to be reconsidered in its grant of three
applications for authority to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back'' configuration.
The comments supporting an AT&T petition for reconsideration in this proceeding raised issues involving complex
questions of international law, international comity and the law of foreign countries, including the allegation
that call-back services employing an uncompleted call signaling configuration violate international law. Therefore,
the Commission is seeking additional comments from the parties and members of the public on all of the issues raised
in the comments supporting AT&T's petition. The Commission also is seeking the advice of the Department of State
regarding the issues of international law, international comity, and the laws of foreign countries. Further, in
order to augment the record with respect to AT&T's assertion that uncompleted call signalling violates the Federal
wire fraud statute, the Commission will seek the advice of the Department of Justice on this issue.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






In the matter of: VIA USA, Ltd. Telegroup, Inc.; Applications for Authority Under Section 214 of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, to operate as International Resale Carriers.




[File Nos. I-T-C-93-031 I-T-C-93-050]




Discount Call International Co.; Application for Authority Under Section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended.




[File No. I-T-C-93-054]



Order



Adopted: September 2, 1994.
Released: September 12, 1994.





By the Commission:

1. On May 11, 1994, the Commission granted the above-referenced Section 214 applications of VIA USA, Ltd., Telegroup,
Inc., and Discount Call International Co. to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back''
configuration.
 This service allows a customer in a foreign country to use foreign facilities to dial a telephone number in the United
States and receive dial tone at a switch at the reseller's U.S. location, which the customer can then use to place a call
via an outbound switched service of a U.S. carrier. The calls originating at U.S. locations are billed at U.S.-tariffed
rates.





2. AT&T petitioned to deny these applications alleging that this service constitutes an unreasonable practice
under Section 201 of the Communications Act (``the Act'') and may constitute wire fraud. We denied AT&T's petition.
 On June 10, 1994, AT&T filed a petition for reconsideration asking us to find that uncompleted call signalling
is an unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the Act, is contrary to the public interest standard of Section
214 of the Act, violates Section 202(a) of the Act, and violates the Federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343.







3. We received comments in support of AT&T's petition from MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI), Sprint
Communication Company L.P. (Sprint), and The Regional Technical Commission on Telecommunications of Central America
(COMTELCA) and the National Telecommunications Institute of Panama (INTEL) (collectively referred to as COMTELCA/INTEL).
Oppositions to AT&T's petition were filed by VIA USA, Ltd. (VIA USA), Telegroup, Inc. (Telegroup) and the Telecommunication
Resellers Association (TRA).

4. Both VIA USA and Telegroup filed motions to strike the comments filed by MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL. AT&T,
MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL opposed the motions to strike the supporting comments. VIA USA and Telegroup argue
in their motions that the comments supporting AT&T's petition are untimely, procedurally defective requests
for the Commission to reconsider its initial grant of Section 214 authority to the above-captioned applicants. In
particular, VIA USA and Telegroup state that Section 1.106(g) of the Commission's Rules only contemplates the filing
of ``oppositions'' to petitions for reconsideration, not comments in support of such petitions. Further, they state
that, in addition to repeating and expounding upon AT&T's arguments in its petition, the COMTELCA/INTEL comments
raise new issues relating to the legality of call-back services under international law and the law of foreign countries.
Alternatively, VIA USA and Telegroup contend that, if we do not grant their motions to strike, we should extend the
reply period several months because COMTELCA/INTEL have raised new arguments not previously raised by any party,
which significantly expand the scope of the proceeding.
5. The comments supporting AT&T's petition raise issues involving complex questions of international law,
international comity and the law of foreign countries. In particular, COMTELCA/INTEL raise the argument that call-back
services employing an uncompleted call signaling configuration violate international law, i.e.

 Article 1.5 and 3.3 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Regulations.
 In addition, COMTELCA/INTEL's comments also claim that the applicants may not offer uncompleted call signalling
services except pursuant to appropriate operating agreements with foreign telecommunications administrations.
Moreover, COMTELCA/INTEL have submitted evidence as to the effect that our authorization of this service may have
on international comity.






6. We conclude that the issues raised in the comments supporting AT&T's petition merit examination. Therefore,
we will, on our own motion, seek additional comment from the parties and members of the public on all of the issues raised
in the comments supporting AT&T's petition.
7. Because we have decided on our own motion to expand the scope of this reconsideration proceeding, we find that the
motions to strike the supporting comments of MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL are moot. These supporting comments
address the issues which we will be examining, and therefore will be made part of the record. We will, however, grant
VIA USA's and Telegroup's alternative request that we further extend the period for filing comments. In addition,
we will seek the advice of the Department of State regarding the issues of international law, international comity,
and the laws of foreign countries. Further, in order to augment the record with respect to AT&T's assertion that
uncompleted call signalling violates the federal wire fraud statute, we also will seek the advice of the Department
of Justice on this issue. Finally, as noted above, because of the general importance of the issues in this case, we will
entertain additional comments from all interested members of the public as well as from the parties to this proceeding.
8. This Section 214 proceeding will continue to be conducted as a non-restricted proceeding in which written and oral


ex parte 

contacts are permitted, but subject to disclosure. 

See 

47 CFR Part 1206.
9. Accordingly, it is ordered that the comments of MCI, Sprint and COMTELCA/INTEL are accepted into the record of this
proceeding, and Telegroup's and VIA USA's motions to strike the comments are dismissed as moot.
10. It is further ordered that this proceeding is opened to the general public and interested persons are invited to
file comments on any of the issues raised in AT&T's petition or the supporting comments by October 14, 1994, and
reply comments by November 14, 1994.
11. It is further ordered that the Secretary shall serve a copy of this Order on each party to this proceeding by certified
mail.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Administration for Children and Families</USBUREAU>


Notice of Solicitation of Nominations for Membership on the 
U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect 


Purpose 


Pursuant to the terms of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act), the Department of Health and Human
Services is soliciting nominations for three vacancies (seats) on the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect
(the Board). 


Membership 


The Board consists of 15 members appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). Thirteen
are appointed from the general public and two from the Federal Government. In making all 15 appointments, the Secretary
is required by the Act to ensure that ethnic and racial minorities and diverse geographic areas are represented. 
All 15 persons appointed must possess general knowledge about child maltreatment (i.e., policy; prevention; intervention;
treatment; and research). In addition, among the 13 members from the general public, 11 must represent one of the following
areas: 
 the legal aspects of child maltreatment; 
 the psychological aspects; 
 the social services aspects; 
 the medical aspects; 
 the role of State and local government in the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect; 
 the role of organizations providing services to disabled persons; 
 the role of organizations providing services to adolescents; 
 the role of elementary and secondary school teaching; 
 the role of parent self-help organizations; 
 the role of parents' groups; and 
 the role of voluntary groups. 
In order to qualify for selection as such a representative, each individual must possess specific knowledge in the
area which he/she represents. 


Responsibilities and Duties 


Among the responsibilities the Act requires the Board to perform is the preparation of an annual report to the Secretary
of Health and Human Services, appropriate committees of the Congress, and the Director of the National Center on Child
Abuse and Neglect. In addition, the Board holds hearings, conducts symposia, and issues position papers. 
In its annual reports, the Board is charged with evaluating the nation's efforts to accomplish the purposes of CAPTA
and developing recommendations about ways that those efforts can be improved. The 1990 report of the Board is entitled,
Child Abuse and Neglect: Critical First Steps in Response to a National Emergency; the 1991 report, Creating Caring
Communities: Blueprint for an Effective Federal Policy on Child Abuse and Neglect; the 1992 report, The Continuing
Child Protection Emergency: A Challenge to the Nation; and the 1993 report, Neighbors Helping Neighbors: A New National
Strategy for the Protection of Children. 
The Board usually meets three times a year, and, occasionally, four times a year. Meetings last three to four days.
Between meetings, much of its work is accomplished by conference call. Service on the Board is extremely demanding
of both time and effort. 
Duties of Board members are: 
 to serve as the Board authority in one or more areas of expertise, keeping current on developments in those areas;

 to be conversant with the extensive array of background information provided to members prior to meetings
and conference calls; 
 to attend meetings; 
 to participate in conference calls; 
 to suggest materials to staff for distribution as background information; 
 to author portions of Board publications; 
 to edit Board publications; and 
 to avoid all possible conflicts of interest between Board membership and non-Board activities.

Terms of Office 


The length of the terms to which persons from the general public are appointed is four years. Once appointed, a person
from the general public may be reappointed to one additional term at the discretion of the Secretary. 


Nomination 


The Department is soliciting nominations for the three seats to be occupied by members possessing specific expertise
in: 
 the social services aspects of child maltreatment; 
 the role of elementary and secondary school teaching; and 
 an at-large seat. 
The terms of the three seats will expire on May 29, 1999. 
Nominations may be made for one's self or for someone else. The same individual may be nominated for a seat in more than
one category. Nominations should be made in the form of a letter which indicates the seat or seats for which the nominee
is being nominated and provides information about the qualifications for office of the nominee. A current curriculum
vita for the nominee should be attached to the letter. (If the nominee is not the person submitting the nomination,
a letter from the nominee indicating a willingness to serve should be attached). All nominations will be evaluated.
To assist in that evaluation, persons submitting nominations may wish to provide the following kinds of information
about the nominee's qualifications: 
 What general knowledge about child maltreatment (i.e., policy; prevention; intervention; treatment; and
research) does the nominee possess and how has he/she gained that knowledge? 
 What specific knowledge does the nominee possess about the aspect of child maltreatment which he/she is being
nominated to represent on the Board and how has he/she gained that knowledge? (If the individual is being nominated
for more than one seat, separate answers should be provided setting forth the individual's specific knowledge in
connection with each seat). 
 What materials has the nominee authored, what presentations has he/she made, what meetings has he/she planned,
et cetera, which shed light on both the general and/or specific knowledge of the nominee? 
 What skills does the nominee possess which will allow him/her to contribute substantially to the conduct of
Board business and what highlights and achievements in the nominee's career shed light on such skills? 
 Does the nominee possess other abilities which are relevant to his/her appointment to the Board? 
 Will the nominee's schedule permit him/her to devote a significant segment of time to Board activities? 
 Is the nominee's ethnic or racial background that of an American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific
Islander, African-American, or Hispanic? 
Each letter of nomination should be accompanied by at least one but no more than three letters of reference attesting
to the nominee's qualifications for office. Authors of reference letters may include but are not limited to: elected
officials (Federal, State, or local); persons in the field of child maltreatment; and persons in the subject area
of the seat being sought. 
The Secretary will select the three persons to be named to the Board from among those individuals either who are nominated
in response to this announcement or who are otherwise qualified to serve. After the Secretary reaches a decision,
those persons selected to serve will receive a letter of invitation. Service will begin on May 29, 1995, or the first
Board meeting thereafter. 
Nomination packages (letter of nomination; attachment(s); and accompanying letter(s) of reference) must be postmarked
no later than October 31, 1994. Packages received with a postmark later than October 31, 1994 will not be considered.

Nominations should be sent to the: 
U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, 
Room 303-D, Hubert H. Humphrey Building, 
200 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20201.

committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Final Program Requirements and Review Criteria for Cooperative Agreements for Centers for Medical Education Research
for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>





The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final program requirements and review criteria
for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Cooperative Agreements for Centers for Medical Education Research. These cooperative
agreements are funded under the authority of section 781, title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by
the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 


Section 781 authorizes research on certain health professions issues. For this cooperative agreement program,
research focuses on the medical education aspects of this legislation and ``medical education'' is defined as education
provided to individuals working toward the M.D. or D.O. degree, or as post-graduate M.D./D.O. education in an accredited
residency or fellowship program. 




Purpose 




The purpose of the Cooperative Agreements for Centers for Medical Education Research is to support research in medical
education, especially regarding existing or proposed federal policies and programs and regarding the impact of
Federal initiatives aimed at improving the training of health professionals and at meeting national workforce goals.



Section 781 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award cooperative agreements for the purpose
of: 


(a) conducting research on the extent to which the debt incurred by medical students for attendance at educational
institutions has had a detrimental effect on the decisions made by the students on entering primary care specialties;



(b) conducting research on the effects that federally-funded educational programs or policies for minority or disadvantaged
individuals have on: 


(A) the number of such individuals attending health professions schools; 


(B) the number of such individuals completing the programs of education involved; and 


(C) the decisions made by such individuals on which of the health professions specialties to enter; 


(c) conducting research on the effectiveness of the States in protecting the public health through: 


(1) identifying health care providers with respect to whom investigations of professional qualifications are warranted;



(2) conducting such investigations; and 


(3) taking disciplinary actions against health care providers determined through such investigations to have engaged
in conduct inconsistent with protecting the public health; 


(d) conducting research: 


(A) to determine the extent to which Federal programs and related financial incentives influence the percentage
of medical school graduates selecting a primary care career; 


(B) to determine the extent to which Federal programs and related financial incentives adequately support the training
of mid-level primary care providers relative to other health professions education receiving Federal assistance;



(C) to assess the impact that direct and indirect payments for graduate medical education (including the appropriateness
of payments for independent, ambulatory training sites) have on increasing the percentage of physicians graduating
from medical school who enter primary care careers; 


(D) to assess the impact of medical school admissions policies on specialty selection and recommend ways admission
policies can better facilitate and promote the selection of primary care as a medical career; 


(E) to assess the impact of Federal funding for biomedical research on the design of medical school curriculum and
the availability of primary care educational opportunities;

(F) to assess the impact of medical school curriculum, including the availability of clinical training in ambulatory
care settings, on the percentage of physicians selecting primary care residencies and selecting primary care as
a medical career; and 


(G) to assess the extent to which current physician payment policies under resource based relative value scale are
sufficient to encourage physicians graduating from medical school to enter and remain in primary care careers. 


In conducting research relative to effect of programs for minority and disadvantaged individuals, the applicant
will make findings specific to the following categories of health professions schools:





(A) Health professions schools of historically black colleges and universities. 


(B) Other health professions schools attended by a substantial number of minority individuals. 


(C) Health professions schools generally. 




Eligibility 




Eligible applicants include public and non-profit private entities. 


This program was announced in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 32444, dated June 23, 1994. The program requirements and review criteria were proposed for public comment.
No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore, the program requirements and review criteria
remain as proposed. 




Final Program Requirements 




The award recipient shall participate in the cost of the program as follows: For each year funds are awarded under this
program, the matching contribution shall be at least one-third of the amount of the Federal award for that year. Up
to 50% of the recipient's matching contribution may be in the form of in-kind donations of faculty time, staff time,
use of computers or other shared resources. 


In addition, each applicant shall evidence that training related to medical education research is occurring or is
planned by the organization. 




Final Review Criteria 




The review of applications will take into consideration the following criteria: 


(1) The qualifications and achievements of the proposed center's principal investigator and senior researchers,
including level of productivity and quality of research in medical education; 


(2) Demonstration of an understanding of the particular subject areas of medical education research that are relevant
to Federal policies and evidence of ability to manage research in such areas; 


(3) The appropriateness of the time commitments of the principal investigator and senior researchers; 


(4) The strength of the applicant's plan to actively promote dissemination of research findings to all health professionals
involved in education and training_including those whom are primarily practitioners, and to relevant policy makers;



(5) The appropriateness of the proposed budget; 


(6) The planned level of commitment to the center from the applicant institution, as evidenced by specific plans for
the type of financial support that will be offered, and for support of the organizational structure of the center.

<DOCTITLE>Notice Regarding Section 602 </DOCTITLE>
of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 
Outpatient Hospital Facilities 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 602 of Public Law 102-585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the
manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under
a statutory formula. 



The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties of final program guidelines concerning the inclusion of
outpatient disproportionate share hospital (DSH) facilities in the PHS drug discount program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


(A) Background 




Proposed guidelines were announced in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 29300 on June 6, 1994. A period of 30 days was established to allow interested parties to submit comments. The
Office of Drug Pricing received 8 letters with comments concerning legal authority for developing the proposed guidelines,
responsibility for determining eligibility, the inclusion of non-traditional outpatient facilities, the need
for a definition of eligible hospital facility, ambiguity in the policies of the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) regarding the Medicare cost report, possible exceptions for unique circumstances, a retroactive effective
date, and general comments concerning the definition of ``patient'' and a contracted pharmacy service mechanism.



The following section presents a summary of all major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment.
All comments were considered, and the guideline is adopted as proposed, with minor changes to increase clarity. 




(B) Comments and Responses 






Comment: 

Manufacturers should not be required to provide discounts to outpatient facilities that are included on the Medicare
cost reports of eligible DSHs until the PHS Office of Drug Pricing includes the names of the eligible outpatient facilities
on the master list of eligible covered entities. 




Response: 

When an eligible DSH submits the list of all outpatient facilities (on-site and off-site) included on its Medicare
cost report and Medicaid billing status information to the Office of Drug Pricing and the Office adds these facilities
to the master list of eligible and participating entities during regular quarterly updates, the facilities will
then be able to access PHS discount pricing. This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System
(EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing. To access this information call (301) 594-4992. 




Comment: 

The proposed guidelines have created a new definition of ``DSH'' which appears to be within the realm of legislating
as opposed to rulemaking. 




Response: 

Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive PHS discount pricing. Section
340B(a)(4)(L) describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act
as eligible to participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient
services only, the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section
340B deals exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intends this narrow definition be used
to identify the Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we
do not believe it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drugs can be used.
Some disproportionate share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities.
Further, the movement of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services,
other than traditional inpatient hospital services, through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities.
Therefore, for purposes of section 340B drug discounts, a further interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed.

Comment: 

In some instances, the Medicare cost report does not include all of the clinics and services which should be eligible
for the PHS discount pricing. For example, hospitals refer patients for specific types of treatments to other hospitals,
such as large teaching hospitals which have specialized equipment and medical personnel. Further, hospitals are
establishing separate primary care services in different areas of the community. These facilities are often free-standing
and not included on the DSH Medicare cost report, but generally are customers of the hospitals and have limited financial
resources. 




Response: 

Although it is understandable that the DSH would desire to obtain PHS pricing for these various facilities, the 
statute clearly states that it is only the DSH that qualifies for discount pricing. We have attempted to define DSH
in a manner consistent with HCFA policy guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section 2024).
Only outpatient facilities which are an integral component of the DSH will be included on the DSH Medicare cost report,
and only these facilities will be eligible for PHS discount pricing. 




Comment: 

The proposed guidelines would permit any health care entity, by means of its business relations with other health
care entities, to make itself eligible for PHS pricing. Any clinic, facility, or community hospital affiliated with
a DSH could consolidate its cost reporting requirements and use the Medicare provider number of the DSH to make itself
eligible for PHS pricing. This is not consistent with Congress's intent in precisely defining a list of entities eligible
for the PHS discount pricing. 




Response: 

Congress referred to section 1886 of the Social Security Act (Medicare inpatient hospital payment) for the definition
of DSH; therefore, it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility for PHS discount
pricing. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and used, in part, to determine
whether a facility is a component of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital cost report,
it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility. 


When a DSH attempts to certify multiple components as a single hospital for purposes of Medicare certification, it
must follow guidelines developed by HCFA. These guidelines (Provider Certification, State Operation Manual, section
2024) establish tests to determine whether an additional hospital facility, geographically separated but in the
same metropolitan area, is a separate facility from or a component of a single hospital. These tests include: (a) all
components subject to the control and direction of one common owner (i.e., governing body) which is responsible for
the operational decisions of the entire hospital enterprise; (b) one chief medical officer who reports directly
to the governing body and who is responsible for all medical staff activities of all components; (c) integration of
the organized medical staff (e.g., all medical staff members having privileges at all components); and (d) one chief
executive officer through whom all administrative authority flows and who exercises control and surveillance over
all administrative activities of all components. This does not preclude the establishment of a deputy or assistant
executive officer position. 


If the off-site clinic meets these tests, it would be included in the DSH Medicare cost report. This test clearly determines
whether a facility is an integral part of a DSH hospital, and is an appropriate standard to determine eligibility.
It incorporates Medicare criteria that are not ambiguous and forms an independent and objective basis on which to
determine eligibility. 



Comment: 

The proposed guidelines should be applied uniformly to all DSH outpatient facilities, regardless of whether they
fit the common perception of a traditional hospital outpatient clinic (e.g., include facilities that serve prison
inmates, HMOs, home infusion and home health patients). Anything short of this would be extremely difficult to administer
since separating traditional from non-traditional facilities would be a highly subjective and time-consuming
exercise. Further, PHS should include in the final notice a specific definition for eligible ``outpatient facility.''

Response: 

Section 340B(b) of the PHS Act refers to section 1927(k) of the Social Security Act for the definition of ``covered
outpatient drug.'' This definition does not include any limitations on outpatient settings, and there is no requirement
that the covered drug be used in a ``traditional'' outpatient setting. Any outpatient facility included on an eligible
DSH's Medicare cost report can access PHS pricing if it is included on the master list of eligible entities. 


Comment: 

There are certain circumstances which might prevent an otherwise eligible outpatient facility from billing under
the DSH's provider number (e.g., State or local laws requiring a facility or pharmacy to bill all third party payers
directly). In these instances, the facility should be permitted to access PHS discount pricing if the eligible DSH
facility can demonstrate that the pharmacy would meet the proposed Medicare test but for the unique circumstances.



Response: 

The test used to determine the eligibility of hospital outpatient facilities must incorporate criteria that form
an independent and objective basis. This will provide fair and easy administration. To include a ``but for'' test
would create a difficult standard to administer. If an outpatient facility is not included on the eligible DSH's Medicare
cost report, it will not meet the requirements for eligibility. 


Comment: 

The effective date of this notice should be made retroactive to December 1, l992. Further, the June 13 deadline for
requesting retroactive rebates or credits should be extended. 


Response: 

In a 

Federal Register

 notice, dated May 13, l994, a deadline was announced for requesting retroactive discounts. Eligible and potentially
eligible covered entities could request these discounts until June 13, 1994. 

See

 59 FR 25112. The notice permits an off-site outpatient DSH facility to receive retroactive discounts if it meets the
following requirements: (1) is included on an eligible DSH's Medicare cost report, (2) has not participated in a group
purchasing arrangement for covered outpatient drugs, (3) has not billed Medicaid for the covered outpatient drugs
for which retroactive discounts are being requested, and (4) has preserved its right to such discounts by sending
manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of drug purchases by June 13,
l994. After this date, the right to retroactive discounts ceased. 

See

 59 FR 25112. (``Any DSH outpatient clinic which is or will be eligible for retroactive discounts may preserve its right
by sending manufacturers a letter requesting such refunds and providing adequate documentation of purchases.'')



Comment: 

There is no definition of the term ``patient,'' thereby permitting a DSH to distribute discounted drugs to virtually
anyone it can argue is a patient without running afoul of the drug resale prohibition of section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the
PHS Act. 


Response: 

PHS will address this issue in a future 

Federal Register

 notice which will request public comment. All comments concerning the definition of ``patient'' will be addressed
at that time. 


Comment: 

PHS has approved a contracted pharmacy service model without public notice and an opportunity to comment. 


Response: 

PHS will discuss the contracted pharmacy service model in a future 

Federal Register

 notice which will invite public comment. All comments concerning this issue will be addressed at that time. 


(C) DSH Outpatient Facility Guidelines 


Set forth below are the final guidelines regarding the inclusion of DSH outpatient facilities: The outpatient facility
is considered an integral part of the ``hospital'' and therefore eligible for section 340B drug discounts if it is
a reimbursable facility included on the hospital's Medicare cost report. For example, if a hospital with one Medicare
provider number meets the disproportionate share criteria and this hospital has associated outpatient clinics
whose costs are included in the Medicare cost report, these clinics would also be eligible for section 340B drug discounts.
However, free-standing clinics of the hospital that submit their own cost reports using different Medicare numbers
(not under the single hospital Medicare provider number) would not be eligible for this benefit.

A DSH, eligible for PHS pricing, must first request that the Office of Drug Pricing include in the PHS drug discount
program the outpatient facilities that are included in its Medicare cost report. A list of these outpatient facilities
along with Medicaid billing status information must be included with the request. Second, an appropriate official
of the DSH must sign a statement that he/she is familiar with HCFA guidelines concerning Medicare certification of
hospital components as one cost center, has examined the list of outpatient facilities, and certifies that the facilities
are correctly included on the DSH's Medicare cost report. When these facilities are added to the master list of eligible
and participating covered entities, the off-site facilities will be able to access PHS discount pricing. On-site
clinics that are not included on the Medicare cost report will not be eligible for PHS discount pricing. This information
will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing, on a quarterly
basis. To access this information, call (301) 594-4992. 
DSHs which have questions concerning this process, or manufacturers which have questions concerning the eligibility
of certain DSH outpatient clinics, should contact Elizabeth Hickey (301-594-4353), at the Office of
Drug Pricing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. General 



The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Public Law (Pub. L.) 100-503) amended the Privacy
Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) by adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. Section
7201 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) further amended the Privacy Act regarding
protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching by Federal
agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State or local government records. It
requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 

(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs; 

(2) Obtain the Data Integrity Boards' approval of the match agreements. 

(3) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget; 

(4) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and 


(5) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating or denying an individual's benefits or payments.



B. SSA Computer Matches Subject to the Privacy Act 



We have taken action to ensure that all of SSA's computer matching programs comply with the requirements of the Privacy
Act, as amended.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background_What is the Process Reengineering Program?


SSA began an Agency-wide program of Process Reengineering in the summer of 1993. The Process Reengineering Program
is one way that SSA is seeking to improve its overall delivery of service to the public.

The Process Reengineering Program essentially asks the question, ``If SSA had the opportunity today to design its
processes, what would they look like?'' In other words, ``how would we design a process if we were starting over?''
The Program
s objective is to fundamentally rethink and radically redesign SSA's processes to achieve dramatic improvements
in critical measures of performance such as quality of service, speed and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to achieve
dramatically improved levels of service from the customer's perspective while enriching and improving the work
lives of employees.

The Process Reengineering Program is the culmination of an investigation by SSA of the reengineering efforts conducted
by private companies, public organizations, academic institutions, and consulting firms with ``hands on'' experience.
The positive findings from that investigation, combined with concerns about the impact of current and projected
workloads, led SSA to conclude that a disability claims process reengineering effort was critical to its objectives
of providing world-class service to the public and restoring public confidence in its disability programs.

Based on analysis of what has worked best in other organizations, SSA developed a customized reengineering methodology.
This methodology used a team approach (composed of SSA and State Disability Determination Service (DDS) employees)
and combined a strong customer focus with classic management analysis techniques to intensely review a single business
process. While the reengineering team was comprised of employees who were knowledgeable about the current disability
process, the methodology focused heavily on obtaining the views of a broad segment of individuals, groups and organizations
involved both internally and externally to the process.



What Does the Disability Reengineering Project Address?



Despite the outstanding efforts of SSA and State DDS employees throughout the country, the Agency continues to have
difficulty providing a satisfactory level of service to claimants filing for disability benefits. The steps in the
current disability process have not changed in any important way since the beginning of the Disability Insurance
program in the 1950s. Yet, case loads, types of disabilities, and the demographic characteristics of individuals
with disabilities who are potentially eligible for benefits have changed radically.

The State DDSs make the initial decisions about whether an applicant for Disability Insurance or SSI benefits is disabled.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 1995, it is estimated that SSA will forward 2.9 million initial disability claims to the DDSs for
disability determinations_a 69 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. Similarly, the number of requests for an administrative
law judge hearing on denied claims is expected to increase to 542,000, a 75 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. Recent
management initiatives to improve service through resource reallocations and productivity enhancements have
not been sufficient to deal successfully with the workload demands and it is expected that disability processing
times and backlogs will continue to grow under the present process.

The result is that many claimants have to wait much too long at each stage of the process. SSA and State DDS employees
are working longer and harder, while becoming increasingly frustrated about their inability to provide the type
of service the public deserves.

For these reasons, the first SSA reengineering project focused on the process of filing for benefits_beginning with
the initial claim and continuing through the payment of benefits or the final administrative appeal_under both the
Disability Insurance program and the disability portion of the SSI program.

The parameters set for this first project restricted the team from proposing any changes to the statutory definition
of disability or the amount of benefits for which individuals are eligible. The project also did not address vocational
rehabilitation, work incentives or continuing disability reviews as these issues are being addressed by SSA in other
ways.



How Was the Disability Process Reengineering Project Accomplished?



The Disability Process Reengineering Project began in October 1993 when a team of 18 Federal and State employees came
together for the purpose of reengineering the initial and administrative appeals system for determining an individual's
entitlement to Disability Insurance and SSI disability payments. After completing their initial tasks of analyzing
the current process, obtaining process improvement recommendations from over 3,600 individuals and groups internal
and external to the disability claim process, benchmarking with public and private sector organizations to identify
``best practices,'' and modeling theoretical processes via computer, the team presented an initial proposal on
March 31, 1994. (A copy of this proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

, Vol. 59, No. 73, on Friday, April 15, 1994.) The team distributed the proposal widely throughout SSA, the State DDSs,
and to interested public and private individuals and organizations and asked the audience for reactions to the proposal,
items of concern, and additional ideas for improvement.

During the comment period that began on April 1, 1994, and ended on June 14, 1994, the team received over 6,000 written
responses from SSA and DDS employees, employee unions, professional associations, members of the public, claimant
representatives, physicians, State governors, claimant advocacy groups, Federal entities, and other interested
parties. Members of the team read and analyzed every one of the comments so that no idea, reaction or nuance would be
overlooked. Group employee feedback discussions were held in over 80 sites across the country to facilitate dialogue
with almost 2,000 SSA and DDS employees. In addition, team members conducted briefings and spoke with more than 3,000
individuals about their reactions to the proposal during this period. A public forum was also held in Washington,
D.C. A summary of the comments received is provided in Appendix III of the attached plan.

After considering all comments, the team reviewed the breadth of the initial proposal to determine concepts that
needed to be revised, language that needed to be clarified, and details that needed to be added. On June 30, 1994, the
team submitted its revised proposal to the Commissioner of Social Security. Subsequently, after careful consideration,
on September 7, 1994, the Commissioner released SSA's Plan for a New Disability Claim Process. Accepting all of the
concepts contained in the team's June 30 revised proposal as SSA's plan, the Commissioner released the redesign plan
with the understanding that certain concepts (primarily aspects of the simplified disability methodology) would
require extensive research and testing before determining how quickly they could be implemented.



What Service Improvements Does the Plan for a New Disability Claim Process Offer?



The Commissioner established five primary objectives against which SSA will measure the success of a redesigned
disability claim process:



_ The process is user friendly for claimants and those who assist them;
_ The right decision is made the first time;
_ Decisions are made and effectuated quickly;
_ The process is efficient; and
_ Employees find the work satisfying.




By focusing on these objectives, the redesigned process replaces an existing process that is slow, labor-intensive,
and paper reliant with a seamless claim process that makes better use of technology, eliminates fragmentation and
duplication, promotes more flexible use of resources, and results in dramatic improvements in public service. With
the redesign plan, SSA has embarked on an era of change that will revitalize and streamline the way it delivers disability
claim service to the public to achieve greater quality, speed and efficiency.

Specific customer focused improvements that the plan will offer include a process that will:
 Be a user-friendly, more accessible and customer focused process, that ensures benefits are paid to all eligible
individuals as quickly as possible. Case processing times will be cut in half once the new process is fully implemented;
 Provide complete and accurate consumer-oriented information to applicants throughout the process and allow
individuals who are able to be full partners in the processing of their claim;
 Utilize modern technology and highly skilled and trained employees to deliver high-quality service in an
accountable, cost-efficient manner;
 Implement a comprehensive quality assurance program that continually strives to improve operational excellence
and the level of service that disability applicants receive; and
 Use education and training opportunities to enrich employees
 jobs, increase their job satisfaction and quality of work life.
A detailed description of the redesigned disability claim process is included in the attached plan.


What Happens Next?


SSA will move quickly to begin implementing the redesigned disability claim process. Some new process features,
involving research and changes to regulations and computer systems, necessitate a phased-in approach. Other new
process features can be implemented in the near-term and, when combined with special short-term initiatives to address
case backlogs, will result in better service for individuals currently filing for disability benefits. The goal
is to make near-term, visible improvements while at the same time building for long-term results.

SSA will make an unprecedented effort to conduct a full and open dialogue with both SSA and non-SSA audiences as the
Agency moves through the implementation phase. The Agency will use all appropriate modes of communication to ensure
that necessary information about implementation activities is regularly and widely disseminated and will develop
appropriate feedback channels to permit the meaningful exchange of information.

Message From the Commissioner 



Social Security Administration's Plan for a New Disability Claim Process 



It was 10 months ago that I challenged this Agency to restore public confidence in its programs, provide world-class
service to its customers, and ensure a nurturing environment for its employees. While there is much left to be done
to meet these goals, I am proud to say that with the release of this document we have reached a major milestone toward
meeting the challenges I set forth. 

This document lays the foundation for the new disability claim process. It is a solid foundation upon which to build_it
provides a broad description of the new process, with the detailed elements of the process to be developed. 

The new design gives us the opportunity to develop relationships with the public and our employees that are based on
open communication, partnership, and the belief that our customers need to be provided as much information as possible
about the process and the program. I believe this new design holds the potential to provide the world-class service
I pledged to furnish the American people_it will be user-friendly, it will ensure the right decision is made the first
time, it will allow decisions to be made and effectuated quickly, and it will be an efficient process. Just as importantly,
the new design will also provide our employees with a nurturing environment through empowerment, education, challenge,
career opportunity, and professionalism. 

As the discussions about our reengineering effort and the future of the disability claim process evolved, I listened
to the issues and opinions and the hopes and fears that have been expressed. I heard from SSA and State employees, the
public, members of Congress, representatives of other Federal agencies, State officials, union representatives,
and various experts in the disability field. I believe that everyone wants something better for the American people.
I am convinced that we must be bold in our efforts. Therefore, I have chosen to accept the recommendations of the Agency's
Disability Process Reengineering Team which were presented to me on June 30, 1994, with the full understanding that
certain aspects of the decisional methodology will require extensive research and testing to determine whether
they can be implemented. Because those aspects of decisional methodology that deal with functional assessment,
baseline of work, and the evaluation of age require much study and deliberation with experts and consumers, we are
making no conclusions about their ultimate place in the disability process. Our implementation plans include the
research needed to begin in this area. As more is known, we will reevaluate our planning assumptions. Until then, the
concept of a single person as the disability claim manager for all cases cannot be fully implemented. Instead, we will
seek ways of working in teams to provide claimants with the level of service they seek. 

The cost of redesigning our disability claim process will not be inexpensive; however, the tangible savings will
be worth the investment. The workyear savings will allow us to use current staff to accomplish other pressing workloads
and activities of the Agency while avoiding new hiring to replace all those who retire or otherwise leave on their own
accord. Thus, we will be able to do our part to reduce the Federal workforce overall. Additionally, with these savings
will come such intangibles as improved customer service, an empowered and better trained workforce, and increased
public confidence in the process. 

It is now time for us to move forward with concrete actions to begin the actual redesign of the way we do business in our
disability programs. On July 12, 1994, I announced that Charles A. (Chuck) Jones, the Director of the Michigan Disability
Determination Service, had accepted the challenge of managing the implementation of SSA's plan to reengineer the
disability process. In that role, he will be responsible for the overall leadership and coordination of the redesign
implementation. He will establish timelines and priorities and will provide direction to component efforts as well
as to task management teams. As Implementation Manager, Chuck will report directly to me and the Principal Deputy
Commissioner. 

During the discussions of the Team's proposal, I heard several consistent underlying themes about how our new design
should be implemented: we must unify the process; we need enabling information technology; we need to ensure the safety
of employees; we must continuously deliver effective training; we must retain the existing Federal/State relationship;
and we must develop a simpler methodology for making disability decisions. I am absolutely committed to turning these
needs into realities as we move ahead. Some will not be easy, and all will take time and money; however, all will need
to be addressed if we are to achieve the successful outcome of the redesign. 

As implementation plans are developed and task teams are brought together, we will continue to assess all related
activities against the five primary objectives of our redesigned process: 





_making the process ``user friendly'' for claimants and those who assist them; 

_making the right decision the first time; 

_making the decision as quickly as possible; 

_making the process efficient; and 

_making the work satisfying for employees.

However, this work will not be done in isolation_ 
internally, we will continue to seek advice on these issues from 
our Advisory Group, comprised of SSA and DDS executives and union 
and association leaders. Externally, we will continue to publicly 
inform all who are interested and create opportunities for 
dialogue and consultation. 
Special thanks are extended to the Disability Process 
Reengineering Team whose recommendations are the result of an 
unprecedented endeavor for this Agency, and I dare say for most 
Federal agencies. The Team's thousands of hours of interviews, 
research, analysis, computer modeling, feedback sessions, and 
revisions have created a daring image for us of what can be if we 
truly seek to provide world-class service. We must accept their 
challenge and begin the arduous task of bringing to reality what 
is now only a concept. 
The next few years will be challenging for all of us as we 
build our redesigned process, but that will not be a new 
experience for those of you who are employees of SSA and the 
State DDSs. You have been called upon in the past to rise to the 
occasion and have always more than met the challenge; your 
flexibility, resourcefulness, professionalism, and just plain 
hard work are legendary. Now more than ever, I will need you to 
be bold and help build a better future for those who seek our 
services.

Case for Action 


Overview 


SSA and the State Disability Determination Services (DDSs) 
have always striven to provide high-quality, responsive service 
to the public. In recent years, the disability insurance (DI) and 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) claims workload has been the 
Agency's most challenging problem. SSA has been faced with 
unprecedented workload increases in both the DI and SSI programs 
which have severely strained its resources. Despite improvements 
in productivity by employees in field offices, DDSs, hearing 
offices, the Appeals Council and the processing centers over the 
last several years, SSA has had difficulty providing a 
satisfactory level of service to claimants for disability 
benefits. SSA recognizes that, in an era of spending limitations 
and competing social spending priorities, placing more and more 
resources into the current process is not a viable alternative. 
Additionally, demographic changes in the general population 
and in the SSA claimant population present challenges as well as 
opportunities as SSA strives to provide world-class service to 
its customers. Despite the workload and demographic changes, 
however, the procedures for processing disability claims have not 
changed in any important way since the beginning of the DI 
program in the 1950's and many of the Agency's current practices 
are based, in large part, on procedures begun 40 years ago. 
Disability process changes that have evolved over time tend to 
reflect small, incremental improvements designed to address 
various pieces of the overall process. It has become increasingly 
clear that incremental improvements are no longer sufficient to 
achieve the level of service that will make a substantial 
difference to disability claimants. Thus, SSA needs a longer-term 
strategy for addressing service delivery problems in the 
disability claim process. 


Workload and Operations Trends 


Over the last several years, as workloads have increased 
dramatically, the disability process has been placed under 
increasing stress. The upward trend in the number of claims and 
the number of beneficiaries awarded is reflected as follows:

The increase in workload has occurred concurrently with 
significant downsizing activity in SSA and staffing fluctuations 
in the State DDSs.

</DOC>

<DOCNO> FR940919-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Even with the downsizing, the total costs for processing initial disability and appeals determinations (excluding
the costs for processing the 

Sullivan 

v. 

Zebley 

court case) remain enormous_more than half of the total administrative costs (including DDS costs) for SSA in Fiscal
Year (FY) 1993 were devoted to this task.

Despite these funds, and despite directing a larger 
percentage of the SSA resources toward disability initial claims 
and appeals processing in recent years, average processing times 
for initial claims, as well as appeals, have escalated 
dramatically since 1988.

The high workload level is expected to continue and will adversely affect SSA's ability to timely process initial
disability claims and appeals. Recent management initiatives to improve service through resource reallocations
and productivity enhancements have not been sufficient to deal successfully with the workload demands and it is expected
that disability processing times and backlogs will continue to grow under the present process. In FY 1995, it is estimated
that 2.9 million initial disability claims will be forwarded to DDSs for disability determinations_a 69 percent
increase over FY 1990 levels. Similarly, in FY 1995, annual requests for administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings
will rise to 542,000, a 75 percent increase over FY 1990 levels. The average time to process an initial disability claim
(the combined average for both DI and SSI claims) is expected to rise to 154 days in FY 1995; the average time from ALJ
hearing request to decision is expected to rise to 342 days in the same period.


Demographic Trends


American society has changed dramatically since the DI program began in the 1950s. This is reflected in an increased
demand for SSA's services, changes in the characteristics of claimants seeking benefits, and new complexities in
claim-related workloads and processes.
The demographic character of the SSA disability claimant population has changed as well. The enactment of the SSI
program in the 1970's added individuals who have limited or no work histories, increased the number of individuals
filing based on disabilities such as mental impairments, and provided for eligibility of disabled children. Additionally,
the requirements of the SSI program added complex and time consuming development of non-disability eligibility
factors such as income, resources and living arrangements. The 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, 

Sullivan 

v. 

Zebley, 

resulted in increased claims for children; children comprised 21 percent of all SSI claims in 1992, up from 11 percent
in 1988. Homeless individuals and others with special needs have strained the delivery system. These claimants require
significant intervention and assistance to navigate the disability claim process.
A trend in the general population which is reflected in SSA's disability claimant population is the increased number
of people in the United States for whom English is not the native language. Recent national Census data indicate that
1 in 7 people speak a language other than English in the home; this is an increase of almost 38 percent in the last 10 years.
SSA will need to accommodate the special communication needs of these claimants in its ongoing claimant contacts
and in public information vehicles.

Forty percent of claimants filing for disability benefits and polled in a recent SSA survey had filed for or received
benefits from Aid to Families with Dependent Children, welfare or social services within the past year. Approximately
three-fourths of them were granted this assistance and three-fourths of those grantees were still receiving assistance
when they applied for disability benefits. SSA has the opportunity to develop productive relationships with these
social service entities to improve the processing of disability claims for mutual customers. 

Technological advances such as personal computers, facsimile machines, electronic mail, and videoconferencing
are increasingly available to our claimants, their representatives, medical providers and other third parties
involved in the disability process. SSA can take advantage of these capabilities to offer expanded service options
and to modernize the ways it interacts with providers of claims-related information and evidence. 



The Current Process 



The procedures in the current process have not changed in any significant way since the DI program began in the 1950s,
a time when caseloads, demographic characteristics of claimants, types of disabilities, and available technology
were radically different. In the 1970s, Congress federalized State programs of cash assistance to the aged, blind
and disabled into the SSI program and added this to the responsibilities of SSA. SSA adopted the DI disability determination
procedures for SSI blind and disabled claims. 



Slow, Manual Process 



In the current process, a disability claim passes through from 1 to 4 decisional paths to receive a favorable decision.
The initial claim, reconsideration, ALJ hearing and Appeals Council review levels all involve multi-step uniform
procedures for evidence collection, review, and decisionmaking.

The process starts at the initial level when an individual 
first applies for DI and/or SSI benefits on the basis of a 
disabling physical or mental condition. An individual calls the 
national toll-free telephone number and is referred to a local 
SSA field office or visits or calls one of 1,300 local field 
offices to apply for benefits. Field office personnel assist with 
application completion, obtain detailed medical and vocational 
history and screen nonmedical eligibility factors. Field office 
personnel forward the claim to 1 of 54 State DDSs where medical 
evidence is developed and a final decision is made regarding the 
existence of a medically determinable impairment which meets the 
definition of disability. The decision is made by an adjudicative 
team consisting of a disability specialist and a program 
physician. 

After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the 
SSA regional Disability Quality Branch, the claim is returned to 
the field office; denials are retained pending possible appeal. 
In FY 1993, 39 percent of initial claims were allowed and sent to 
1 of 7 processing centers (which include the Office of Disability 
and International Operations and the 6 Program Service Centers) 
for final processing and storage, as well as adjudication of 
claims for dependents. Allowed SSI claims remain in the field 
office for payment effectuation and folder retention. A sample of 
these are reviewed after payment for nondisability quality 
assurance. According to SSA's computer-based processing time 
measurements, an initial claim currently takes an average of 
about 100 days to process from the time of filing until a 
decision is made. However, from the claimant's perspective, a 
better understanding of how long the process takes comes from a 
1993 study conducted by SSA
s Office of Workforce Analysis, which 
showed that an average claimant waits up to 155 days from the 
initial contact with SSA until receiving an initial claim 
decision notice. During this period, 16 to 26 employees will 
handle the claim. 

The claimant may request reconsideration of the initial 
decision within 60 days of receiving the denial notice. In FY 
1993, claimants requested reconsideration in 48 percent of denied 
claims. Local field office personnel receive the reconsideration 
request, update necessary information, and forward the claim file 
to the DDS for review, possible medical development, and a 
medical decision. The reconsideration decision is made by a 
different adjudicative team than the one that made the initial 
determination. 

After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the 
regional Disability Quality Branch, about 14 percent of these 
claims are returned to the field office for payment and 
forwarding to a processing center; the remaining denials are 
forwarded to the field office for retention, pending possible 
further appeal. According to SSA
s computer-based processing time 
reports, the average reconsideration takes about 50 days_however, according to the Office of Workforce Analysis
study, a 
claimant has now been involved with the disability process for 
roughly 8 months from the initial contact with SSA, and up to 36 
different employees could have handled the claim. 

A claimant can request a hearing before an ALJ within 60 
days of receiving an unfavorable reconsideration decision. In FY 
1993, claimants requested an ALJ hearing in about 75 percent of 
all reconsideration denials. By this time, a claimant has usually 
retained an attorney or other representative to assist in 
pursuing the claim for benefits. About 75 percent of all 
claimants retain a representative at the hearing level. Local 
field office personnel receive the request for hearing and 
forward it with the claim file to one of 132 local SSA hearings 
offices. Hearing office personnel review the file for possible 
additional development, conduct a hearing, and render a decision. 

DI claims allowed at the hearing level are sent to a 
processing center for payment effectuation and adjudication of 
claims for dependents, and storage. Allowed SSI claims are 
returned to the local field office for income and resource 
development, and payment. Denied claims are forwarded to the 
Appeals Council for retention pending a possible request for 
review. According to computer-based reports, the hearing process 
takes about 265 days. However, according to the Office of 
Workforce Analysis study, a claimant has been dealing with SSA 
for over a year and a half at this point in the process.

<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If dissatisfied with the hearing decision, a claimant (or 
representative) may request Appeals Council review within 60 days 
of receiving the ALJ decision. In FY 1993, about 23 percent of 
hearing decisions were unfavorable. The Appeals Council considers 
about 18 percent of all ALJ dispositions, including cases it 
reviews on its own motion. Requests for Appeals Council review 
are typically received directly from the claimant's 
representative. The Appeals Council may deny or dismiss a request 
for review, issue a decision, or remand the claim to an ALJ. The 
Appeals Council remands claims to the ALJ level about 27 percent 
of the time for subsequent development and decision. Denied 
claims, representing about 70 percent of the Appeals Council 
dispositions, are held in the Appeals Council for possible appeal 
to Federal District court. Allowed claims are sent to a 
processing center or field office for further action as in 
hearing cases. According to processing time reports, this part of 
the process takes on average about 100 days; however, according 
to the Office of Workforce Analysis study, a claimant has spent 
almost 2 years dealing with SSA since initially contacting the 
Agency. 

At least part of the processing time results from the time 
added as the claim moves from one employee or facility to another 
(handoffs), and waits at each employee's workstation to be 
handled (queues). As workloads increase, the amount of time a 
claim waits at each processing point grows. 

``Task time'' is the time employees actually devote to working 
directly on a claim, rather than the total amount of time it 
takes for a claimant to receive a final decision. Based on the 
Office of Workforce Analysis study, a claimant can wait as long 
as 155 days from the first contact with SSA until receiving an 
initial claim decision notice_of which only 13 hours of this is 
actual task time. The same study reveals a claimant can wait as 
long as 550 days from that initial contact through receipt of the 
hearing decision notice_of which only 32 hours is actual task 
time.

Complex, Confusing Process 



Many applicants enter the SSA disability process uninformed 
about the process itself and the definition of disability. They 
are unaware of the criteria for establishing disability and the 
evidence they will be required to submit. Even third parties and 
advocate organizations, often more knowledgeable than the general 
public about SSA procedures, experience difficulty obtaining 
meaningful information about the status of their clients
 claims, 
finding that they often are transferred from one employee to 
another. 

Disability claimants face a ``one size fits all'' approach to 
the intake and processing of their claim, finding themselves 
answering questions they believe are intrusive and irrelevant to 
their claim. Front-line employees currently devote hours to 
completing forms and obtaining information which may not be 
necessary for a finding of disability. Claimants often do not 
understand what happens to the claim after initial contact with 
SSA and view multiple requests for medical information with 
annoyance. Often claimants do not understand how the decision was 
made and, therefore, believe that it was reached arbitrarily. If 
the claim is approved, whether at the initial or appellate level, 
claimants and their representatives, as well as front-line 
employees, are concerned about the complicated procedures and 
length of time it takes to effectuate payment and entitle 
eligible dependents. 

SSA employees, claimants, and other interested parties all 
agree that the current process takes too long to provide 
applicants a decision, and leaves them confused about who has 
responsibility for their claim, and puzzled about the status of 
their claim during various points in the process. Additionally, 
nearly all believe that many claimants can and should assume more 
responsibility for submitting evidence and pursuing their claim. 

Most view the reconsideration step as little more than a 
rubber stamp of the initial determination, creating additional 
work for employees and yet another bureaucratic obstacle for 
claimants and their representatives. Some believe a face-to-face 
interview with the decisionmaker is vital to reaching a fair, 
accurate determination; others believe just as strongly that the 
decision should be reached on the basis of a paper review, and 
that a face-to-face interview can lead to subjective decisions 
that are not based on objective criteria. Quality reviews and 
Appeals Council reviews are often mentioned as areas where 
opportunities exist for streamlining and improving the current 
process. 

Claimants and their representatives have learned their 
chances for a favorable decision improve if they appeal their 
claim to an ALJ. The public, in particular, believes that it is 
necessary to hire an attorney to maneuver through the appeals 
process, and voices resentment at having to do so. Higher 
allowance rates at the ALJ level lead to the perception that 
different adjudicative standards apply at the initial and appeals 
levels. A variety of factors may be contributing to this. The 
facts of many cases change over time as a claimant
s condition 
changes. ALJs often have access to information not considered at 
lower levels in the process because earlier decisionmakers are 
not as likely to have face-to-face interaction with the claimant. 



Contributors to Complexity 



The collection of medical evidence presents problems as the 
case is developed, accounting for a considerable portion of the 
total time involved in disability claim processing. Health care 
providers who are a claimant
s treating source often do not 
understand the requirements for establishing disability, and find 
medical evidence request forms confusing and repetitive. They 
believe that evidence requests burden them with far too much 
paperwork and offer far too little in the way of compensation for 
the time invested. Adjudicators often find that evidence is 
primarily treatment-oriented and fails to provide either the 
highly specialized clinical findings or the functional 
information that is required by the regulations. To compensate 
for poor or missing medical evidence, DDSs purchase consultative 
examinations, devoting substantial resources to scheduling, 
purchasing, and processing these examinations. 

Once the medical evidence has been collected, the 
methodology used by disability decisionmakers is complex and 
controversial. The current sequential evaluation process, which 
was originally designed to identify and evaluate cases in a 
simple, rapid and consistent fashion has grown increasingly 
complex as the result of court decisions and changes in medical 
technology. This complexity has, in turn, contributed to the 
increasing difficulty and fragmentation in other portions of the 
disability process, including intake, evidence collection, and 
appeals. 

For example, the Listings of Impairments was originally 
designed to highlight readily identifiable disabling impairments. 
Many of the Listings have since evolved into complex and highly 
detailed diagnostic requirements, demanding specialized medical 
evidence that may not be readily available from treating sources. 
Some, but not all, of the Listings consider the functional 
consequences of an impairment; however functional considerations 
vary significantly among the Listings. Additionally, in assessing 
an individual
s functional abilities at the later steps in the 
sequential evaluation, adjudicators collect and analyze evidence 
from a multitude of different, and often conflicting, sources 
including: objective clinical and laboratory findings; treating 
source opinions and other third-party statements considered to be 
consistent with the objective evidence; and the individual
s 
description of his or her limitations. The development of 
extensive medical evidence in every case impedes timely and 
efficient decisionmaking. The varying approaches to assessing a 
claimant
s functional ability that are required at different 
steps in the sequential evaluation, along with the nature and 
types of evidence that adjudicators may rely on to assess 
function often lead to different interpretations of the same 
evidence by different adjudicators. Vocational rules originally 
designed to provide a structured approach to decisionmaking have 
grown increasingly complex, leading to varying interpretations 
and inconsistent decisions. 



Fragmented Process 



The fragmented nature of the disability process is driven by 
and exacerbated by the fragmentation in SSA's policy making and 
policy issuance mechanisms. Policy making authority rests in 
several organizations with few effective tools for ensuring 
consistent guidance to all disability decisionmakers. Different 
vehicles exist for conveying policy and procedural guidance to 
decisionmakers at different levels in the process. While the 
standards for disability decisionmaking are uniform, they are 
expressed in different wording in the various policy vehicles. 

Training on disability is not delivered in a consistent 
manner, nor is it provided simultaneously to disability 
decisionmakers across or among levels in the process. Mechanisms 
for reviewing application of policy among levels of the process 
are fragmented and inconsistent. Review of DDS decisions is 
heavily weighted toward allowances; no systematic quality 
assurance program is in place for hearing decisions although the 
opportunity for feedback from the Appeals Council or from the 
courts is heavily weighted toward denials. 

The organizational fragmentation of the disability process 
creates the perception that no one is in charge of it. SSA 
measures the process from the perspective of the component 
organizations involved, rather than the perspective of the 
claimant. Multiple organizations (field offices, DDSs, hearings 
offices, Appeals Council operations, and processing centers) have 
jurisdiction over the claim at various points in time, with each 
line of authority managing toward its own goals without 
responsibility to the overall outcome of the process. 
Additionally, the impact of one component
s work product on other 
components is not measured, further contributing to the 
fragmentation of the process. Each component's narrow 
responsibilities reinforce a lack of understanding among 
component employees of the roles and responsibilities of other 
employees in different components. 



The Need for a Redesigned Disability Claim Process

Concerns about the Agency's business processes generally, 
and the quality of service in the disability claim process in 
particular, led SSA leadership to the conclusion that a 
disability process reengineering effort was critical to the SSA 
goal of providing world-class service to its customers. The 
National Performance Review, headed by the Vice President, 
directed improvement of the SSA disability process as a key 
service initiative for the Federal government. 


Leading private sector organizations have used process 
reengineering to identify and quickly put in place dramatic 
improvements in their operations. The objective of a 
reengineering review is to fundamentally rethink and radically 
redesign a business process from start to finish, so that it 
becomes many times more efficient and, as a result, significantly 
improves service to the organization's customers. By focusing on 
the disability claim process as a single business process, SSA 
hoped to cut across the organizational lines and multiple 
components that handle the many pieces of the disability process. 




Redesign Technique 




A project team composed of 18 Federal and State employees, 
under the direction of an SSA senior executive, assembled at SSA 
Headquarters in October 1993 to conduct the disability claim 
process reengineering review. With the guidance of an Executive 
Steering Committee the Team was challenged to fundamentally 
rethink the way SSA processes disability claims. The Team's 
initial findings and proposal, issued in March 1994, for a 
redesigned disability claim process were widely shared during a 
60-day public comment period. Based on the comments received, the 
Team presented a revised proposal to the Commissioner of Social 
Security on June 30, 1994. After extensive consultation with 
individuals and organizations in the internal and external 
disability community, the Commissioner accepted the Team's 
recommendations for a redesigned disability process. A summary of 
the methodology used to redesign the disability claim process is 
included in Appendix I. 



New Process Goals and Expectations 



The Commissioner established five primary objectives against 
which SSA will measure the success of a redesigned disability 
claim process: 




_The process is user friendly for claimants and those who 
assist them; 

_The right decision is made the first time; 

_Decisions are made and effectuated quickly; 

_The process is efficient; and 

_Employees find the work satisfying.

By focusing on these objectives, the redesigned process 
replaces an existing process that is slow, labor-intensive, and 
paper reliant with a seamless claim process that makes better use 
of technology, eliminates fragmentation and duplication, promotes 
more flexible use of resources, and results in dramatic 
improvements in public service. With the redesigned process, SSA 
has embarked on an era of change that will revitalize and 
streamline the way it delivers disability claim services to the 
public to achieve greater quality, accuracy, speed and 
efficiency. A detailed description of the redesigned disability 
claim process is presented in the following section. 




Description of the New Process 




Overview 




Claimants for disability benefits under the new process will 
be provided a full explanation of SSA's programs and processes at 
the initial contact with SSA. Claimants will be offered a range 
of options for filing a claim and conferring with decisionmakers, 
using various modes of technology to interact with SSA. 
Claimants, who are able to do so, along with third parties and 
representatives who act on their behalf, will assist in the 
development of their claims, deal with a single contact point in 
the Agency, and have the right to a personal interview with 
decisionmakers at each level of the process. The number of steps 
will be consolidated and the issues on appeal will be focused. If 
the claim is approved, the effectuation of payment to the 
claimant, eligible dependents and the representative will be 
streamlined.

<TEXT>
 

The new process will result in correct decisions at the 
earliest possible point in the process. A correct disability 
decision is one that appropriately considers whether an 
individual does or does not meet the factors of entitlement for 
disability as defined by SSA's statute, regulations, rulings and 
policies. Correct decisions in the new process depend on: a 
simplified decision methodology that provides a common frame of 
reference for deciding disability at all levels of the process; 
consistent direction and training to all adjudicators; enhanced 
and targeted collection and development of medical evidence; an 
automated and integrated claim processing system that will assist 
adjudicators in evidence gathering, analysis and decisionmaking; 
and a single, comprehensive quality review process across all 
levels. The goal of the new process is to guide all adjudicators 
at all levels of the process, who will be using the same 
standards for decisionmaking, to making correct decisions in an 
easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner. 
A disability claim manager will handle most aspects of the 
disability claim at the initial level, thus eliminating many 
steps caused by numerous employees handling discrete parts of the 
claim (handoffs) and the time lost as the claim waits at each 
employee's workstation to be handled (queues). This will reduce 
the time needed to rework files and redevelop information from 
the same evidentiary sources. Levels of appeal will be combined 
and improved, reducing the need to redevelop nonmedical 
eligibility factors after a favorable decision because less time 
will have elapsed since initial filing. 
The new process will enable the current work force to handle 
an increased number of claims, freeing the most highly 
specialized staff (physicians and ALJs) to work on those cases 
and tasks that make the best use of their talents, and targeting 
expenditures for medical evidence to those areas most useful in 
determining disability. 
Employees will perform a wider range of functions, using 
their skills to their full potential, enabling them to meet the 
needs of claimants and minimize unnecessary rework. The new 
process will facilitate employees' ability to do the total job by 
providing technology and the training and support to use that 
technology. [

For ease of reference, references in this plan to 
``SSA'' or ``employees'' include both Federal and State employees who 
participate in the disability process.

Process Entry and Intake 


Customized Intake and Entry 


The disability claim entry and intake processes will reflect 
the SSA commitment to providing world-class service to the 
public. The hallmarks of the process will be accessible, personal 
service that ensures timely and accurate decisions. SSA will work 
to make potential claimants better informed about the disability 
process and fully prepare them to participate in it. Every effort 
will be made to provide services to meet the needs of culturally 
diverse, non-English speaking claimants. SSA will also be 
flexible in providing modes of access to the claim process that 
best meet the needs of claimants and the third parties and 
representatives who act on their behalf. SSA will provide 
claimants with a single point of contact for all disability 
claim-related business. Finally, SSA will ensure that the 
disability decisionmaking process promotes timely and accurate 
decisions. 


Making Program Information Available 


SSA will make available to the general public comprehensive 
information packets about the DI and SSI disability programs. 
[

For ease of reference, references in this plan to the SSI 
Disability Program include the Program for those who are blind.

] 
The packets will include information about the purpose of the 
disability programs; the definition of disability; the basic 
requirements of the programs; a description of the adjudication 
process; the types of evidence needed to establish disability; 
and the claimant's role in pursuing a claim. The packets may be 
customized locally to include referral information about other 
programs and resources for legal representation. The goal is to 
target the information to likely beneficiaries and to ensure that 
potential claimants and other groups involved in the disability 
process have a better understanding of SSA disability programs, 
their medical and nonmedical requirements, and the nature of the 
decisionmaking process. This should result in reduction of 
general inquiries from members of the public unfamiliar with SSA 
disability programs and increase the number of claimants who 
enter the disability process knowledgeable and prepared to assume 
responsibility for pursuing their claims. 
SSA will make disability information packets commonly 
available in the community, both at facilities frequented by the 
general public (libraries, neighborhood resource centers, post 
offices, the Department of Veterans Affairs offices, and other 
Federal government installations) and at facilities frequented by 
potential claimants (hospitals, clinics, other health care 
providers, schools, employer personnel offices, State public 
assistance offices, insurance companies, and advocacy groups or 
third-party organizations that assist individuals in pursuing 
disability claims). SSA studies have shown that claimants 
frequently rely on advice from their physicians and from State 
public assistance personnel in deciding whether to file a claim 
for disability benefits. Therefore, SSA will make a special 
effort to target its public information activities at these and 
other known sources of referrals for claims. SSA will also make 
the disability information packets available electronically.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to comprehensive program information, the 
packets will describe the types of information that a claimant 
will need to have readily available when the individual files a 
claim. It will also contain two basic forms: The first, designed 
for completion by the claimant, will include general identifying 
information and will serve as the claimant's starter application 
for benefits; the second, designed for completion by the treating 
source(s), will request specific medical information about a 
claimant's alleged impairments. SSA will encourage claimants who 
are able to do so to review the information in the packet and 
have the basic forms completed prior to telephoning or visiting 
an SSA office to apply for disability benefits. Claimants will be 
encouraged to immediately submit starter applications to protect 
the filing dates for benefits. The starter application will serve 
as a claim for both programs, but it will include a disclaimer 
should the claimant want to preclude filing for benefits based on 
need (

i.e.,

 SSI). 


Claimants Will Choose Mode of Entry 


The disability claim entry process will be multi-faceted, 
allowing claimants and third parties and representatives who 
assist them the maximum flexibility in deciding how they will 
participate in the process. Claimants may choose to enter the 
disability claim process by telephoning the SSA toll-free number, 
electronically, by mail, or by telephoning or visiting a local 
office. Claimants may also rely on third parties to provide them 
assistance in dealing with SSA. Finally, claimants may formally 
appoint representatives to act on their behalf in dealing with 
SSA. SSA field managers will also have the flexibility to tailor 
the various service options to their local conditions, 
considering the needs of client populations, individual 
claimants, and the availability of third parties who are capable 
of contributing to the application process. 
If an individual submits a starter application by mail or 
electronically, SSA will contact the claimant to schedule an 
appointment for a claim intake interview or, at the claimant's 
option, conduct an immediate intake interview by telephone. 
If an individual telephones SSA to inquire about disability 
benefits, the SSA contact will explain the requirements of the 
disability program, including the SSA definition of disability, 
and provide a general explanation of evidence requirements. The 
SSA contact will determine whether the individual has the 
disability information packet, and mail it or advise the claimant 
regarding possible means of electronic access. If an individual 
indicates a desire to file a claim at that time, the SSA contact 
will complete the starter application available on-line as part 
of the automated claim processing system to protect the 
claimant's filing date and schedule an appointment for a claim 
intake interview. The interview may be in person or by telephone 
at the claimant's option. If the individual has no medical 
treating sources, the SSA contact will annotate this information 
within the on-line claim record. 
If a claimant visits an SSA office, the SSA contact will 
refer the claimant for an immediate claim intake interview or, at 
the claimant's option, complete the starter application and 
schedule a future appointment for an intake interview. 
In all cases, appointments for claim intake interviews will 
be made available within a reasonable time period, generally 3 to 
5 working days, but no later than two weeks. 
Local management will determine how to best accommodate 
claimants' needs in learning about the disability process and 
completing a claim intake interview. Depending on an individual's 
circumstances, such accommodation may involve: Referral to the 
nearest location for obtaining a disability information packet 
which can then be mailed in; an immediate telephone or in-person 
interview; arranging for an on-site visit from an SSA 
representative; or referral to appropriate third parties who can 
provide assistance. Additionally, depending on the nature of the 
individual's disability, SSA may encourage the individual to file 
in person when it appears that a face-to-face interview will 
assist in the proper claim intake and development; however, face- 
to-face interviews will not be required in every claim. 
Face-to-face interviews, when considered necessary by either the 
claimant or SSA, can also be accomplished via videoconferencing. 
In any case, SSA will make every reasonable effort to meet the 
needs of the claimant in completing the application process. 
Every effort will be made to provide services to members of the 
public who have limited knowledge of English. 
Similarly, local managers will modify the claim entry and 
intake process to provide maximum flexibility for representatives 
who act on behalf of claimants or third parties who can assist 
claimants in completing the application process. Such 
accommodations may include, but are not limited to: (1) Using 
automated means to interact with SSA to protect a claimant's date 
of filing (e.g., telephone, fax, or E-mail); (2) providing 
appointment slots for third parties to accompany claimants to 
interviews or to provide assistance during telephone claims on a 
claimant's behalf; (3) out-stationing SSA personnel at a 
third-party location to obtain applications and/or medical 
evidence, when appropriate; and (4) providing ``open appointment'' 
scheduling to permit claimants to contact SSA within a flexible 
band of time. Interested third parties will be encouraged to 
participate in the development of claims. 
Local managers will also conduct outreach efforts that are 
designed to meet the needs of hard-to-reach populations or assist 
those individuals unable to access the SSA claim process without 
considerable intervention. As appropriate, outreach efforts may 
be facilitated through videoconferencing, teleconferencing or 
other electronic methods of obtaining and processing claim 
information to provide timely service despite claimants' 
geographic or social isolation. 


Disability Claim Manager 


A disability claim manager will have responsibility for the 
complete processing of an initial disability claim. The 
disability claim manager will be a highly-trained individual who 
is well-versed in both the medical and nonmedical aspects of the 
disability programs and has the necessary knowledge, skills, and 
abilities to conduct personal interviews, develop evidentiary 
records, and adjudicate disability claims to payment. However, 
the disability claim manager will also be able to call on other 
SSA resources, including medical and technical support personnel, 
to provide advice and assistance in the claim process. 
Disability claim managers will rely on an automated claim 
processing system that will permit them to: Gather and store 
claim information; develop both medical and nonmedical evidence; 
share necessary facts in a claim with medical consultants and 
specialists in nonmedical or technical issues; analyze evidence 
and prepare well-rationalized decisions on both medical and 
nonmedical issues; and produce clear and understandable notices 
that accurately convey all necessary information to claimants. In 
making decisions, disability claim managers will use a simplified 
decision methodology that effectively streamlines evidence 
collection, and will rely on standards for decisionmaking that 
are used at all levels of the process. 
The disability claim manager will be the focal point for 
claimant contacts throughout the claim intake and adjudication 
process. The disability claim manager will explain the disability 
programs to the claimant, including the definition of disability 
and how SSA determines if a claimant meets disability 
requirements. The disability claim manager will also convey what 
the claimant will be asked to do throughout the process; what the 
claimant may expect from SSA during this process, including 
anticipated timeframes for decision; and how the claimant can 
interact with the disability claim manager to obtain more 
information or assistance. The disability claim manager will 
advise the claimant regarding the right to representation and 
provide the appropriate referral sources for representation. The 
disability claim manager will also advise the claimant regarding 
community resources, including the names of organizations that 
could help the claimant pursue the claim. The goal will be to 
give the claimant access to the decisionmaker and allow for 
ongoing, meaningful dialogue between the claimant and the 
disability claim manager.

Scope of Duties 



The broad scope of the disability claim manager's duties and 
responsibilities, as outlined above and discussed in more detail 
in the following sections, presupposes a well-trained, skilled, 
and highly motivated workforce that has the program tools and 
technological support to issue quality decisions. Although 
disability claim managers will work exclusively within the 
disability programs, they will perform multiple tasks instead of 
singular activities, enabling them to experience the direct 
relationship between their actions and the final product. Varying 
levels of job complexity provide the opportunity for personal 
development, growth, and learning. 

In carrying out their duties and responsibilities, 
disability claim managers will work in a team environment with 
internal medical and nonmedical experts, who provide advice and 
assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as technical 
and other clerical personnel who may handle more routine aspects 
of case development and payment effectuation. Where disability 
team members cannot be physically co-located, they can share 
information via the automated claim processing system and remain 
in communication using telephones or videoconferencing. Each 
disability team member will have at least a basic familiarity 
with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how he 
or she complements another's efforts; team members will be able 
to draw upon each other's expertise on complex issues. 

In this team environment, and with the proper training, 
program tools (a simplified decision methodology and one set of 
standards for decisionmaking) and technological support, one 
individual should be able to handle the duties and 
responsibilities of the disability claim manager. An individual 
employee as the disability claim manager is basic to the 
objective of a single point of Agency contact for claimants. 

However, in the near term, it may be necessary to consider 
whether the duties of a disability claim manager may be more 
appropriately carried out by more than one individual and, 
therefore, whether it is necessary to expand the ``disability 
team'' described above to include additional employees. Claim 
complexity, customer service needs, and service area location may 
dictate a need for flexibility in delineating the specific duties 
of the individuals who comprise the members of the disability 
team. In the near term, apprentice positions will be developed in 
which employees perform one or more duties of the disability 
claim manager while gaining experience and qualifying for greater 
responsibility. As the program tools and technological support, 
which are the underpinnings of the new process, are fully 
implemented, it is envisioned that team duties and positions will 
be modified and consolidated as necessary to fully realize the 
goal of an individual employee as disability claim manager. 



Process Flexibility 



The disability claim manager will conduct a thorough 
screening of the claimant's medical and nonmedical eligibility 
factors. If the claimant appears ineligible for either disability 
program based on the claimant's allegations and evidence 
presented or available at the time of the claim intake interview, 
the disability claim manager will explain this to the claimant. 
However, the decision regarding whether to file an application 
will be the claimant's alone and the disability claim manager 
will not discourage a claimant from filing an application. If the 
claimant decides not to file a claim, the disability claim 
manager will follow existing procedures for closing out an oral 
inquiry. 

If the claimant decides to file, the disability claim 
manager will complete appropriate application screens from the 
automated and fully integrated (DI and SSI) claim processing and 
decision support system. Impairment-specific questions will 
assist the disability claim manager in obtaining information that 
is relevant and necessary to a disability decision. Based on the 
claimant's statements and the evidence that is available at the 
interview, the disability claim manager will determine the most 
effective way to process the claim. If the evidence is sufficient 
to decide the claim, the disability claim manager will take 
necessary action to issue a decision and, if necessary, 
effectuate payment. The disability claim manager will determine 
what additional evidence is required to adjudicate the claim and 
will take steps to obtain that evidence. Such steps may include 
asking the claimant to obtain further medical or nonmedical 
evidence if the claimant is able to do so, requesting medical 
evidence directly from treating sources, or ordering further 
medical evaluations. As in the current process, SSA will pay for 
the reasonable cost of providing existing medical evidence. If 
the claimant has a formal representative, the representative will 
have the responsibility to develop medical and nonmedical 
evidence. 

The disability claim manager will decide whether to defer 
nonmedical development (e.g., requesting SSI income and resource 
information, or developing DI dependents' claims) or do it 
simultaneously with development of the medical aspects of the 
claim. In making this decision, the disability claim manager will 
take into account the type of disability alleged, evidence and 
other information presented by the claimant, and other relevant 
circumstances, e.g., terminal illness, homelessness or difficulty 
in recontacting the claimant. Because the disability claim 
manager maintains ownership of the claim throughout the initial 
decision-making process, the disability claim manager will be in 
the best position to choose the most efficient and effective 
manner of providing claimants with timely and accurate decisions 
while meeting claimants' individual service needs.

<TEXT>
 

Although the disability claim manager will be responsible 
for the adjudication of an initial claim, the disability claim 
manager will call in other staff resources, as necessary. With 
respect to disability decisionmaking, the disability claim 
manager will, in appropriate circumstances, refer claims to 
medical consultants to obtain expert advice and opinion. SSA will 
develop guidelines to assist the disability claim manager in 
determining when expert medical advice is appropriate. Similarly, 
other staff resources will be called upon for technical support 
in terms of certain claimant contacts and status reports; 
development of nondisability issues including auxiliary claims or 
representative payee issues; and payment effectuation. However, 
the disability claim manager will make final decisions on both 
the medical and nonmedical aspects of the disability claim. 



Claimant Partnership 



Throughout the disability claim process, SSA will encourage 
claimants to be full partners in the processing of their claims. 
Many claimants are able to obtain the documentation necessary to 
develop their record, either on their own or with the assistance 
of a third party. Others have substantial difficulty doing so, 
and may have no third party to assist them. Given the range of 
claimant capabilities, SSA will retain ultimate responsibility 
for development of claims when claimants are not formally 
represented. 

To the extent that they are able, claimants and their 
families and other personal support networks will actively 
participate in the development of evidence to substantiate their 
claim for disability benefits. SSA will provide assistance and/or 
engage third-party resources, when necessary and appropriate. SSA 
will keep claimants informed of the status of their claims, 
advise claimants regarding what additional evidence may be 
necessary, and inform claimants what, if anything, they can do to 
facilitate the process. 

At the completion of the claim intake interview, the 
disability claim manager will issue a receipt to the claimant 
that will identify what to expect from SSA and the anticipated 
timeframes. It will also identify what further evidence or 
information the claimant has agreed to obtain. Finally, it will 
provide the name and telephone number of the disability claim 
manager for any questions or comments which the claimant may 
have, including any difficulty in obtaining the information the 
claimant agreed to obtain. 



Third Parties 



Certain third-party organizations may be willing to provide 
a complete disability application package to SSA. Based on local 
management
s assessment of service area needs and the 
availability of qualified organizations, SSA will recognize 
third-party organizations who are capable of providing a complete 
application package, including appropriate application forms and 
medical evidence necessary to adjudicate a disability claim. In 
such claims, SSA will permit the third party to identify 
potential claimants, screen for medical and nonmedical criteria, 
and contact SSA to protect the filing date. The third party will 
interview the claimant; complete all applications and related 
forms; obtain completed treating source statements; and obtain 
additional medical evaluations, when appropriate. Using 
procedures agreed on with local management, the third party will 
submit claims for adjudication by a disability claim manager. SSA 
will monitor such third parties to ensure that quality service is 
provided to claimants and to prevent fraud. SSA may establish 
rules, standards, and procedures for third-party interaction with 
claimants and SSA. Third parties may be required to undergo 
periodic program, procedural or software training, and may be 
required to meet standards for staffing and automation support. 
In individual cases, disability claim managers may elect to 
contact the claimant for the purpose of verifying identity or 
other claim-related issues, as appropriate. SSA will also perform 
ongoing document verification on a sample basis to assure the 
integrity of claims submitted by third parties. The automated 
claim processing system will facilitate effective monitoring of 
the claim-taking and evidence submission practices of third 
parties by permitting random and/or targeted selection of claim 
files involving specific third parties or specific types of 
evidence. 



Personal Interview With Claimant 



When the evidence does not support an allowance, the 
disability claim manager will issue a predecision notice advising 
the claimant of what evidence has been considered and providing 
the opportunity to submit further evidence, if any, and/or the 
opportunity for a personal interview within 10 calendar days. The 
predecision notice will further advise the claimant that if he or 
she does not submit evidence or request a personal interview 
within the 10 days, the claim will be decided based on the 
evidence of record. If the claimant requests a personal 
interview, the disability claim manager will conduct the 
interview in person, by videoconference, or by telephone, as the 
disability claim manager determines is appropriate under the 
circumstances. In appropriate circumstances, this predecision 
interview may be held concurrently with the initial intake 
interview. If the claimant identifies further available evidence, 
the disability claim manager will advise the claimant to obtain 
the evidence if the claimant is able to do so or, as necessary, 
assist the claimant in obtaining it. The claimant will be advised 
of the specified timeframes for submitting additional evidence. 

In preparing the predecision notice, the disability claim 
manager will rely on existing information available on-line as 
part of the automated claim processing and decision support 
system. As part of the evidence gathering process, the disability 
claim manager will have previously analyzed all the medical and 
non-medical information gathered, and entered the pertinent data 
into the electronic claim record. The decision support system 
will use the accumulated data in the electronic record to assist 
the disability claim manager in producing the predecision notice. 



``Statement of the Claim'' 



The initial disability determination will use a statement 
of the claim'' approach. The statement of the claim will set forth 
the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence 
considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a 
result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of 
the determination. The statement of the claim not only reflects 
SSA
s commitment to fully explaining the basis for its action but 
also recognizes that claimants need clear information about the 
basis for the determination to make an informed decision 
regarding further appeal. 

As with the predecision notice, much of the information that 
will provide the basis for the statement of the claim will be 
available on-line as part of the automated claim processing and 
decision support system. Adjudicators will create the statement 
of the claim and whatever supplementary information is necessary 
for a legally sufficient notice to the claimant based on the 
information in the decision support system. For allowance 
decisions, the statement of the claim will be more abbreviated 
than for denial decisions; however, it will contain sufficient 
information to facilitate quality assurance reviews and/or 
continuing disability reviews. The statement of the claim will be 
part of the on-line claim record and will be available to other 
adjudicators as the basis and rationale for the Agency
s action, 
if the claimant seeks further administrative review. 

In making initial disability determinations, disability 
claim managers will rely on standards for decisionmaking that are 
used at all levels of the process. SSA will develop a single 
presentation of all substantive policies used in the 
determination of eligibility for benefits and all decisionmakers 
will be bound by these same policies. These policies will be 
published in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Expert systems will be developed to facilitate the development 
and delivery of disability policy as an integrated part of the 
automated claim processing system.

SSA must have a structured approach to disability decisionmaking that takes into consideration the large number
of claims (2.7 million initial disability decisions in FY 1994) and still provides a basis for consistent, equitable
decisionmaking by adjudicators at each level. The approach must be simple to administer, facilitate consistent
application of the rules at each level, and provide accurate results. It must also be perceived by the public as straightforward,
understandable and fair. Finally, the approach must facilitate the issuance of timely decisions. 

As described further below, the goal of the new decisionmaking approach is to focus decisionmaking on the functional
consequences of an individual's medically determinable impairment(s). The new process will assess an individual's
functional ability, assess it once in the process, do it directly rather than indirectly, and rely on standardized
functional assessment instruments to do so. By focusing on function, the new approach will permit both providers
of medical evidence and adjudicators at all levels of the process to use a consistent frame of reference for deciding
disability, regardless of the diagnosis. It will also facilitate evidence collection by lessening the need for voluminous
medical records and, instead, look at the consequences of medical findings, i.e., function. Ultimately, adjudicators
will make correct decisions in an easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner. 

The cornerstone of the new approach is, of course, the statutory definition of disability. Under the statute, disability
(for adults) means the:





``. . .inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable
physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last
for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. . .An individual shall be determined to be under
a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable
to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of
substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy. . .'' ( 223(d) of the Social
Security Act). 



Four-Step Evaluation Process for Adults 



The new decisionmaking approach is the foundation on which SSA will base the claim intake process and evidence collection.
The focus will be, first, to document the medical basis for concluding that an individual has a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment. Second, once the evidence establishes a medically determinable impairment(s),
decisionmakers will, in most cases, use additional medical findings to determine the link between the disease or
impairment and the loss of function. 

The disability decision methodology will consist of four steps that flow from the statutory definition of disability.
They are: 

Step 1_Is the individual engaging in substantial gainful activity? 

If yes, deny. 

If no, continue to Step 2. 

Step 2_Does the individual have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment? 

If no, deny. 

If yes, continue to Step 3.* 

Step 3_Does the individual have an impairment included in the Index of Disabling Impairments i.e., an impairment
that clearly restricts functional ability to a degree that the individual is unable to engage in substantial gainful
activity without measuring the individual's functional ability? 

If yes, allow.*


If no, continue to Step 4. 

Step 4_Does the individual have the functional ability to perform substantial gainful activity? 

If yes, deny. 

If no, allow.*

 




*An impairment must meet the duration requirement of the statute; a denial is appropriate for any impairment that
will not be disabling for 12 months.






Step 1_Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity 



Any individual who is engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found disabled regardless of the severity
of the individual's physical or mental impairments. Under the new approach, SSA will simplify the monetary guidelines
for determining whether an individual who is an employee (except those filing for benefits based on blindness) is
engaging in substantial gainful activity. In making this determination, SSA will evaluate the work activity based
on the earnings level that is comparable to the upper earnings limit in the current process (i.e., $500). A single earnings
level will simplify the evidentiary development necessary to evaluate work activity and establish the appropriate
onset date of disability. Additionally, SSA will continue to exclude impairment-related work expenses in evaluating
whether an individual's earnings constitute substantial gainful activity. SSA will continue to evaluate whether
work activity is done under special conditions and/or is subsidized. Finally, SSA will continue to use separate earnings
criteria to evaluate the work activity of blind individuals in the DI program as in the current process.

Step 2_Medically Determinable Impairment 



Because the statute requires that disability be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,
the absence of a medically determinable impairment will justify a finding that the individual is not disabled. Under
the new approach, decisionmakers will consider whether an individual has a medically determinable impairment or
combination of impairments, but will no longer impose a threshold ``severity'' requirement. Rather, the threshold
inquiry will be whether the individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination
of impairments. To establish the presence of a medically determinable impairment, evidence must show an impairment
that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically
acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. 

Decisionmakers will continue to evaluate the existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a weighing
of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will
support a finding that the individual has a medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments. There
must be medical signs and findings established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques
which show the existence of a physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments. Depending on the nature
of an individual's alleged impairment(s), SSA will consider the extent to which medical personnel other than physicians
can provide evidence of a medically determinable impairment. 

There will be an exception to the requirement that evidence include medically acceptable clinical and/or laboratory
diagnostic techniques. This will occur when, even if SSA accepted all of the individual's allegations as true, SSA
still could not establish a period of disability; under these circumstances, SSA will not require evidence to establish
the existence of a medically determinable impairment. For instance, if an individual describes a condition as one
that will clearly not meet the 12-month duration requirement, (e.g., a simple fracture), SSA will deny the claim on
the basis that even if the allegations were medically documented, SSA could not establish a period of disability.




Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments 



If an individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment documented by medically acceptable
clinical and laboratory techniques, and the impairment will meet the duration requirement, the decisionmaker will
compare the individual's impairment(s) against an index of severely disabling impairments. The index will describe
impairments so severely debilitating that, when documented, can be presumed to equal a loss of functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity without assessing the individual's functional ability. The index will
be consistent with the statutory definition of disability by limiting the presumption of inability to perform substantial
gainful activity, without considering age, education and previous work, to a relatively small number of claims with
the most severe disabilities. Individual functional ability will be assessed in all other cases in a consistent manner
at Step 4 in the process. 

Because the index will permit severely disabling impairments to be identified quickly and easily, it will only consist
of descriptions of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to substantiate the existence and
severity of the particular disease entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical as possible and
will exclude such things as calibration or standardization requirements for specific tests and/or detailed test
results (e.g., pulmonary function studies or electrocardiogram tracings). The index will be easy to understand
and simple enough so that laypersons will be able to understand what is required to demonstrate a disabling impairment
in the index. Additionally, SSA will draw no conclusions about the effect of an individual's impairments on his or
her ability to function merely because an individual's impairment(s) does not meet the criteria in the index. Finally,
SSA will no longer need the concept of ``medical equivalence'' in relation to the index. Because impairments included
in the index are presumed to limit functional ability so as to preclude substantial gainful activity without reference
to an individual's age, education and previous work, a combination of impairments, or an impairment closely related
to one that is in the index, would be found disabling when an individual's functional ability is assessed. Therefore,
rules for determining equivalence for impairments in the index will not be necessary. 



Step 4_Ability to Engage in Any Substantial Gainful Activity 



The majority of disability claims will be evaluated using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability
to perform substantial gainful activity. This standardized approach will realistically measure an individual's
functional ability to do the principal dimensions of work and task performance. The approach will be known and accepted
in the medical community. It will be universally used by public and private disability programs in which benefits
are based on the ability to perform work-related duties. Standardizing the approach to assessing individual functional
ability will facilitate consistent decisions regardless of the professional training of the decisionmakers in
the disability process. 

In using a standardized approach to measuring functional ability, SSA will be assessing the individual's physical
and mental abilities to perform work-related activities. Individualized assessments of functional ability will
also consider the effects of the individual's education. Once the individualized assessment of functional ability
is made, the individual's age will determine whether his or her functional ability is compared against the demands
of the individual's previous work or against a ``baseline'' of occupational demands. The baseline will describe
a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy
that does not require prior skills or formal job training. 



Standardized Measure of Functional Ability 



SSA will develop, with the assistance of the medical and advocacy community and other outside experts from public
and private disability programs, standardized instruments or protocols which can be used to measure an individual's
functional ability. These standardized measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and laboratory
findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination
of impairments. However, extensive development of all available clinical and laboratory findings will not always
be necessary in evaluating an individual's functional ability to perform basic work activities.

<TEXT>
 

Functional assessment instruments will be designed to measure, as objectively as possible, an individual
s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands that includes the principal dimensions of work and task
performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes. Examples of task performance
include, but are not limited to: physical capabilities, such as sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling;
mental capabilities, such as understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; using judgment;
responding appropriately to supervisors and co-workers in usual work situations; and responding appropriately
to changes in the routine work setting; and postural and environmental limitations. To the extent that current regulations
already set forth guidelines for evaluating an individual's ability to perform certain of these tasks, they will
be utilized in the new process.

Functional assessment instruments will be designed to realistically assess an individual
s abilities to perform a baseline of occupational demands. To the extent possible, objective measures of function
will be developed. However, a realistic and individualized assessment of function may require, in addition to objective
measures of function, a standardized means or standardized tools for collecting information regarding an individual
s perceptions of his or her functioning, the effect of symptoms, including pain, and the individual
s activities of daily living. Functional assessment instruments may also require impairment-specific measures
to account for the episodic nature of certain impairments or to meet a more general need for longitudinal information.

SSA will be primarily responsible for documenting functional ability using the standardized functional assessments.
In the near term, SSA will solicit information on which to base a functional assessment from treating medical sources,
other nonmedical sources, and from claimants in a manner that is similar to the current process. In the future, the
standardized functional assessments will be widely available and accepted so that functional assessments may be
performed by a variety of medical sources, including treating sources. The SSA goal will be to develop functional
assessment instruments that are standardized, that accurately measure an individual
s functional abilities and that are universally accepted by the public, the advocacy community, and health care professionals.
Ultimately, documenting functional ability will become the routine practice of physicians and other health care
professionals, such that a functional assessment with history and descriptive medical findings will become an accepted
component of a standard medical report.

Disability insurance payers have incentives to participate in the research necessary to develop standardized functional
assessments and some private insurers have already expressed interest in working with SSA in this effort. Standardized
functional assessments will not only provide SSA with the functional information necessary to make disability decisions;
functional measurements will also assist in developing provider reimbursement levels relating to rehabilitation
and in assuring quality in rehabilitation programs by permitting assessment of the relationship between rehabilitative
interventions and outcomes. Ultimately, the use of the same functional assessment measurements by both SSA and medical
insurance payers will facilitate the cooperation and participation of the medical community in developing, refining,
and implementing them.



Baseline Occupational Demands



SSA will use the results of the standardized functional assessment in conjunction with a new standard that SSA will
develop to describe basic physical and mental demands of a baseline of work that represents substantial gainful activity
and that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.

To develop the new approach, SSA will conduct research and will work in conjunction with outside experts and consumers
to specifically identify the activities that comprise a baseline of occupational demands needed to perform substantial
gainful activity. The baseline will describe a range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in
significant numbers in the national economy. In establishing the work-related functions that comprise an appropriate
baseline of occupational demands, SSA will ensure that: 1) the functional activities are a realistic reflection
of the demands of occupations that exist in significant numbers in the national economy; and 2) the occupations are
those that can be performed in the absence of prior skills or formal job training.

The Department of Labor
s Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) has made recommendations for developing a new DOT
by 1996 which will be a data base system that collects, produces, and maintains accurate, reliable, and valid information
on all occupations in the national economy. This new system will provide comprehensive occupational data that includes,
but is not limited to: physical demands of work; sensory/perceptual requirements; cognitive job demands; physical
working conditions; and job characteristics such as pace or intensity of work, and the scope of interactions with
others. The development of a national data base with detailed occupational information should assist SSA in conducting
the initial research necessary to identify a baseline of occupational demands that represents work existing in significant
numbers in the national economy. It should also provide a mechanism to ensure that the baseline of occupational demands
remains current and reflects changes in the national economy over time.

Effect of Education



The statute recognizes that education may play a role in an individual's ability to perform substantial gainful activity.
Experience demonstrates that educational level alone, i.e., the numerical grade level that an individual has attained,
may not be a good indicator of ability to function. For example, completion of a certain educational level in the remote
past, without any practical application of that education in recent work activity, has no positive effect on an individual's
ability to perform substantial gainful activity. Similarly, completion of a certain grade level does not necessarily
represent mastery of the subject matter.

In relying on standardized functional assessments, SSA will be measuring an individual's ability to perform the
principal dimensions of work and task performance, including primary physical, psychological, and cognitive processes,
and the positive effects of education will be appropriately reflected in the assessment of an individual's cognitive
abilities. Thus, evaluation of a claimant's educational level will be done as an integral part of establishing the
functional ability of that individual. The baseline of occupational demands will not reference prior skills or significant
formal job training.

The issue of whether literacy and/or specific communication or language skills will be a factor in disability evaluation
depends on the extent to which such skills are occupational demands of work existing in significant numbers in the
national economy. In conducting the necessary research to identify the occupational demands of baseline work that
represents work existing in significant numbers in the national economy, SSA will need to consider whether literacy
or specific communication and language skills are required as occupational demands.



Effect of Age



The effect of aging on the ability to perform substantial gainful work is very difficult to measure, especially in
the context of today's world when individuals are living longer than preceding generations. Despite this change,
the demographic characteristics of those preceding generations continue to provide the framework for disability
decisionmaking because SSA's approach for deciding disability has changed little since the inception of the DI program.

The statute recognizes that age should be considered in assessing disability on the assumption that the ability to
make a vocational adjustment to work other than work an individual has previously done may become more difficult with
age. In determining the impact of age, recognition should be given to the changes that occur with each succeeding generation.
Accordingly, in the new process, SSA will establish an age criterion in relation to the full retirement age. The full
retirement age will gradually increase over time, based on the recognition that succeeding generations can expect
to remain in the workforce for longer periods than the preceding generation.

In applying age criterion under the new process, an individual who falls within the prescribed number of years preceding
the full retirement age will be considered as nearing full retirement age.'' In establishing what the prescribed
number of years should be, SSA will conduct research and consult with outside experts on the relationship between
age and an individual's ability to make vocational adjustments to work other than work the individual has done in the
recent past.

SSA will rely on the age of the individual in relation to the full retirement age to decide which of two decision paths
to follow as described in the next two sections.



Individuals Not Nearing Full Retirement Age



For an individual who is not nearing full retirement age, SSA will compare the individual's functional abilities
against the functional demands of the baseline work. The ability to perform the baseline work will represent a realistic
opportunity to perform substantial gainful activity that exists in significant numbers in the national economy
and a finding of disability will not be appropriate.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940919-2-00098 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, anyone who cannot perform the baseline work will be 
considered unable to engage in substantial gainful activity, and 
a finding of disability will be justified. The range of work 
represented by less than the baseline will be considered so 
narrow that despite any other favorable factors, such as young 
age or higher education or training, an individual would not be 
expected to have a realistic opportunity to perform substantial 
gainful work in the national economy. 

For individuals who are not nearing full retirement age, the 
ability or inability to perform previous work is not a 
significant factor. These individuals should be capable of making 
a vocational adjustment to other work, as long as they are 
functionally capable of performing the baseline work. 



Individuals Nearing Full Retirement Age 



For individuals who are nearing full retirement age, SSA 
will compare the individual
s functional abilities against the 
functional demands of the individual
s previous work. Individuals 
nearing full retirement age can not be expected to make a 
vocational adjustment to work other than work they have performed 
in the recent past. However, consistent with the statute, if an 
individual, even one nearing full retirement age, is capable of 
performing his or her previous work, SSA will find that the 
individual is not disabled. 

For those individuals who have no previous work, SSA will 
compare the individual
s functional ability to the range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant 
numbers in the national economy, i.e., baseline work, and a 
finding of not disabled will be appropriate if the individual is 
capable of performing the baseline work. In such claims, when the 
fact that the individual has no previous work is not related to 
the existence of his or her impairment(s), a finding of 
disability will not be appropriate if the individual retains the 
functional ability to perform a range of work-related functions 
that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the 
national economy. In contrast, those individuals who have 
significant functional limitations caused by a medically 
determinable impairment and lack of education would not be able 
to perform a range of work-related functions that represent work 
existing in significant numbers in the economy. Such individuals 
would be found disabled, as they are today. 



Medical Consultant Expertise 



SSA will continue to rely on medical consultants to provide 
expert advice and opinion regarding medical questions and issues 
that will arise in deciding disability claims. Disability 
adjudicators at all levels of the administrative review process 
will call on the services of medical consultants to interpret 
medical evidence, analyze specific medical questions, and provide 
expert opinions on existence, severity and functional 
consequences of medically determinable impairments. Additionally, 
on a national basis, SSA may identify specific types of issues 
that may require a medical opinion. If a medical consultant is 
called on to offer expert advice and opinion, the medical 
consultant will provide a written analysis of the issues and 
rationale in support of his or her opinion. The written analysis 
will be included in the record and will be considered with the 
other medical evidence of record by disability adjudicators at 
all levels of administrative review. Additionally, medical 
consultants will assist in the training of other consultants and 
disability adjudicators; contact other health care professionals 
to resolve medical questions on specific claims; carry out public 
relations and training with the medical community; and 
participate in the quality assurance program. 



Childhood Disability Methodology 



As with adults, SSA must have a structured approach to 
disability decisionmaking in childhood claims that takes into 
consideration the relatively large number of claims and still 
provides a basis for consistent, equitable decisionmaking by 
adjudicators at all levels of administrative review. The approach 
for childhood claims must also derive from the statute. Under the 
statute, ``an individual will be considered to be disabled for purposes of 
this title if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful 
activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or 
mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or 
which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous 
period of not less than 12 months 

(or in the case of a child 
under the age of 18, if he suffers from any medically 
determinable physical or mental impairment of comparable 
severity).

''  1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) 

Of course, any decision approach for childhood claims must 
be consistent with the Supreme Court
s interpretation of this 
statutory language in 

Sullivan v. Zebley,

 493 U.S. 521 (1990). 



Four-Step Evaluation Process for Children 



The disability decision methodology for childhood claims 
will consist of four steps that are based on the statutory 
definition of disability. As with adults, the approach is one 
that provides accurate decisions that can be achieved efficiently 
and cost-effectively, primarily by ensuring that documentation 
requirements are directed toward the ultimate finding of 
disability. To the extent possible, the approach for childhood 
claims should mirror the adult approach. The four steps are: 

Step 1_Is the child engaging in substantial gainful activity? 

If yes, deny. 

If no, continue to Step 2. 

Step 2_Does the child have a medically determinable physical 
or mental impairment? 

If no, deny. 

If yes, continue to Step 3.* 

Step 3_Does the child have an impairment that is included in 
the Index of Disabling Impairments? 

If yes, allow.* 

If no, continue to Step 4. 

Step 4_Does the child have an impairment(s) of comparable 
severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an 
adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity? 

If yes, allow.* 

If no, deny. 






*An impairment must meet the duration requirement of the statute; 
a denial is appropriate for any impairment that will not be 
disabling for 12 months. 



Step 1_Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity

<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Any child who is engaging in substantial gainful activity 
will not be found disabled regardless of the severity of his or 
her physical or mental impairments. The guidelines for 
determining whether a child is engaging in substantial gainful 
activity will be identical to the guidelines for adults. Although 
the issue of work activity will arise infrequently in childhood 
claims, the step is warranted for two reasons: 1) the approach 
for adults and children should be as similar as possible; and 2) 
as a child approaches age 18, it is increasingly likely that work 
activity may be an issue. 



Step 2_Medically Determinable Impairment 



Because the statute requires that disability be the result 
of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or 
combination of impairments, the absence of a medically 
determinable impairment will justify a finding that a child is 
not disabled. To establish the presence of a medically 
determinable impairment or combination of impairments, evidence 
must show an impairment that results from anatomical, 
physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are 
demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory 
diagnostic techniques. 

The same guidelines and rules that apply for adults will 
apply equally for children. SSA will continue to evaluate the 
existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a 
weighing of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that 
neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will 
support a finding of disability. 

SSA will use the same exception for evidence collection in 
childhood claims that will be applied in adult claims. If a child 
has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that 
is not an exception to further development, SSA will then 
evaluate whether the impairment(s) is included in the index of 
disabling impairments. 



Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments 



If a child has a medically determinable physical or mental 
impairment or combination of impairments documented by medically 
acceptable clinical and laboratory techniques and the 
impairment(s) will meet the duration requirement, SSA will 
compare the child's impairment(s) against an index of disabling 
impairments. 

As with adults, the index for childhood claims will function 
to quickly identify severely disabling impairments. The index 
will describe impairments so severely debilitating that the 
impairment is of comparable severity to an impairment that would 
prevent an adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity 
without assessing the child's functional ability. As with adults, 
individual functional ability in childhood claims will be 
assessed in a consistent manner at Step 4 in the process. 

The index for childhood claims will consist of descriptions 
of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to 
substantiate the existence and severity of the particular disease 
entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical 
as possible and will be simple enough so that laypersons will be 
able to understand what is required to substantiate a disabling 
impairment in the index. As with adults, SSA will draw no 
conclusions about the effect of a child's impairments on his or 
her ability to function merely because a child's impairment(s) is 
not included in the index. Additionally, SSA will no longer use 
the concept of ``medical equivalence'' or functional equivalence in 
relation to the childhood index. 



Step 4_Comparable Severity to an Impairment(s) That Would 
Prevent an Adult From Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity 



Consistent with the approach for adult claims, SSA will 
develop, with the assistance of the medical community and 
educational experts, standardized instruments which can be used 
to measure a child's functional ability. These standardized 
measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and 
laboratory findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the 
existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination 
of impairments. The functional assessment instruments will be 
designed to measure, as objectively as possible, a child's 
ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively 
in an age-appropriate manner. Ultimately, the course of 
documenting and developing for functional abilities in childhood 
claims will, to the extent possible, mirror the adult approach. 
However, SSA will consider whether it is appropriate to defer the 
development of standardized functional assessment instruments for 
use in childhood claims until it gains experience in the 
development, refinement and use of such instruments for adults. 

SSA will use the results of the standardized functional 
assessments to determine whether a child has impairment(s) of 
comparable severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an 
adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity, as in the 
current process. 



Medical Evidence Development 



Timely and Accurate Decisions 



SSA's ability to provide timely and accurate disability 
decisions depends to a significant degree on the quality of 
medical evidence it can obtain and the speed with which it can 
obtain it. The medical evidence collection process accounts for a 
considerable portion of the total time involved in processing 
disability claims. 

The new process will eliminate multiple, repetitive requests 
for information from health care providers. Health care providers 
will be relieved of requests for information that burden them 
with far too much paperwork and will be compensated for the time 
invested in providing information. 



Core Diagnostic and Functional Information Focus 



The goals of the evidence collection process will be to 
focus requests for evidence on the critical diagnostic and 
functional assessment information necessary for a disability 
decision and to form a new partnership with the sources of this 
information so that it can be obtained in the most efficient, 
cost-effective manner. Medical evidence development will be 
driven by the four-step approach used to decide disability. Two 
of the core elements of that approach are: (1) identifying an 
individual's medically determinable impairments (including those 
that meet the Index of Disabling Impairments criteria); and (2) 
assessing the functional consequences of those impairments. The 
decisionmaker will develop medical evidence that is sufficient to 
satisfy the core elements but target evidentiary development to 
obtain only the evidence necessary to reach an accurate decision 
on the ultimate question of disability.

<TEXT>
 

Treating Source Preference 



SSA will give primary emphasis to obtaining medical 
information from treating sources that provides brief, but 
specific, diagnostic information regarding an individual's 
medically determinable impairments and the functional 
consequences of those impairments. Treating source statements 
will include diagnostic information about a claimant's 
impairments, the clinical and laboratory findings which provide 
the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration, response to 
treatment, and the functional limitations that can reasonably be 
linked to the clinical and laboratory findings. Depending on the 
nature and extent of an individual's impairments and treating 
sources, statements from multiple medical sources may be 
appropriate. Once the standardized measurement criteria described 
earlier are widely available, a standardized functional 
assessment available from a treating source will be accepted as 
probative evidence. Treating sources or another examining source 
may perform the standardized functional assessment at SSA's 
expense. 



Standardized Request Form 



SSA will develop a standardized form which effectively 
tailors a request for evidence to the specific diagnostic and 
functional assessment information necessary to make a disability 
decision. Such information includes but is not limited to 
diagnostic information about a claimant's impairments, the 
clinical and laboratory findings which provide the basis for the 
diagnosis, onset and duration, response to treatment, and the 
functional limitations that can reasonably be linked to the 
clinical and laboratory findings. Treating sources will be 
encouraged to submit such information electronically. 
Standardizing requests for evidence in this manner will 
facilitate the participation of claimants, representatives and 
third parties in the evidence collection process. 

The form will permit treating sources to provide necessary 
diagnostic and functional assessment information in summary form 
on a single document. In appropriate circumstances, SSA will 
accept a treating source's statements on the standardized form as 
to history and diagnosis, the clinical and laboratory findings 
which provide the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration, 
response to treatment, and the functional limitations that can 
reasonably be linked to the clinical and laboratory findings, 
without resorting to the traditional, wholesale procurement of 
actual medical records. In completing standardized forms, 
treating sources will certify that they have in their possession 
the medical documentation referred to in the statement and that 
said documentation will be promptly submitted at the request of 
SSA. The certification approach does not relieve treating sources 
from providing objective evidence in support of their diagnoses 
and opinions; rather it is designed to streamline the collection 
of necessary evidence. The approach is also consistent with 
evidence collection methods used by private disability insurance 
carriers, which request specific medical records in individual 
claims, when necessary and appropriate to the individual 
circumstances, or at random as part of a quality assurance 
program. 

Treating source completion of the standardized forms will be 
monitored to prevent fraud. Decisionmakers will verify treating 
source statements by obtaining underlying medical records when 
appropriate. The automated claim processing system will 
facilitate effective monitoring of the evidence submission 
practices of individual treating sources by permitting random 
and/or targeted selection of claim files involving that treating 
source for quality assurance and program integrity reviews. 



Treating Source Incentives 



As in the current process, SSA will pay for the reasonable 
cost of providing existing medical evidence. SSA will acknowledge 
the value of treating source information by establishing a 
national fee reimbursement schedule for medical evidence. The fee 
reimbursement schedule will utilize a sliding-scale mechanism to 
reward the early submission of medical information; additionally, 
the sliding scale will be adjusted to reflect the quality of the 
evidence received. A national, sliding-scale fee schedule will 
provide incentives for treating sources to cooperate in the 
evidentiary development process and invest quality time to 
provide medical certifications on behalf of their patients. 

SSA will provide resources to focus professional educational 
efforts and medical relations outreach at the local and/or 
regional level to ensure that treating sources are given 
up-to-date information on program requirements and made aware of 
specific evidentiary needs or problems as they arise in the 
adjudication process. SSA will conduct educational outreach on 
the national level on an ongoing basis with the medical community 
to provide a better understanding of the SSA disability programs, 
the medical and functional requirements for eligibility, and the 
best ways to provide medical information needed for 
decisionmaking. 



Consultative Examination 



If a claimant has no treating source, or a treating source 
is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary evidence, or 
there is conflict in the evidence that can not be resolved 
through evidence from treating sources, the decisionmaker will 
refer the claimant for an appropriate consultative examination. 
Because the standardized measurement criteria for assessing 
function will be widely available, consulting sources will be 
able to perform functional assessments that, in the absence of 
adequate treating source information or where there are 
unresolved conflicts in the evidence, will be considered 
probative evidence. Depending on the service area, SSA will 
consider contracting with large health care providers to furnish 
consultative examinations for a specified geographic location. 

As part of an ongoing training and medical relations 
program, SSA will ensure that providers of consultative 
examinations are provided adequate training on disability 
requirements. Those medical providers who conduct consultative 
examinations for SSA will also need ongoing training regarding 
changes in the disability program. SSA will prepare training 
programs for this audience which will utilize written, audiotape, 
videotape, and computerized training methods. 



Administrative Appeals Process 



Simple, Accessible Process 



To eliminate the public perception that multiple, mandatory 
appeal steps are obstacles to receiving timely, fair, and 
accurate decisions, SSA will reduce the number of mandatory 
appeals steps in the administrative process. Streamlining the 
appeals process will not only promote more timely decisions but 
also ensure that claimants do not inappropriately withdraw from 
the claim process based on a perception that it is too difficult 
or time-consuming to pursue their appeal rights.

Claimants will be able to fully participate in the 
administrative appeals process with or without a representative. 
SSA will ensure that claimants are fully advised of their right 
to representation and SSA will routinely provide the appropriate 
referral sources for representation. SSA will also encourage the 
early participation of a representative when the claimant has 
appointed one and will give the representative responsibility for 
developing evidence necessary to decide a claim. However, the 
decision whether to appoint a representative must remain with the 
claimant and SSA will neither encourage nor discourage claimants 
in seeking representation. 

The administrative appeals process will instill public 
confidence in the integrity of the system. To instill such 
confidence, SSA will provide an initial decisionmaking process 
that is thorough and results in fully developed records with fair 
and accurate decisions. Additionally, the claimant will be given 
the basis of a decision in clear and understandable language. 
Finally, SSA will ensure that its policies have been consistently 
applied at all levels of administrative review. 

As noted previously, the initial disability determination 
will use a ``statement of the claim'' approach which will set forth 
the issues in the claim, the relevant facts, the evidence 
considered, including any evidence or information obtained as a 
result of the predecision notice, and the rationale in support of 
the determination. The statement of the claim will be part of the 
on-line claim record and will stand as the basis and rationale 
for the Agency's action, if the claimant seeks further 
administrative review. SSA will standardize claim file 
preparation and assembly, including the use of appropriate 
electronic records, at all levels of administrative process until 
such time as the claims record is fully electronic. 



First Appeal Level 



Because the initial determination will be the result of a 
process that ensures fully developed evidentiary records and 
ample opportunity for the claimant to personally present 
additional evidence prior to an adverse determination, there will 
be no need for any intermediate appeal (e.g., reconsideration) 
prior to the ALJ hearing. If the claimant disagrees with the 
initial determination, the claimant may, within 60 days of 
receiving notice, request an ALJ hearing. 



Adjudication Officer 



When a claimant requests an ALJ hearing, an adjudication 
officer will conduct an interview in person, by telephone, or by 
videoconference, and become the primary point of contact for the 
claimant. The adjudication officer will have the same knowledge, 
skills and abilities as the adjudicators who decide claims 
initially. The adjudication officer will also have specialized 
knowledge regarding hearings procedures. The adjudication officer 
will be the focal point for all prehearing activities but will 
work closely with the ALJ, medical consultants and the disability 
claim manager, when appropriate. 

The adjudication officer will provide the claimant an in-depth understanding of the hearing process, with particular
focus 
on the right to representation. To prevent delays caused by a 
lack of understanding of this right, the adjudication officer 
will again provide the appropriate referral sources for 
representation; give the claimant, where appropriate, copies of 
necessary claim file documents to facilitate the appointment of a 
representative; and encourage the claimant to decide about the 
need for and choice of a representative as soon as is practical. 
The adjudication officer will be available to answer the 
claimant's questions and concerns regarding the hearing process. 

The adjudication officer will also identify the issues in 
dispute and whether there is a need for additional evidence. If 
the claimant has a representative, the representative will have 
the responsibility to develop evidence. If the claimant has a 
representative, the adjudication officer will also conduct 
informal conferences with the representative, in person or by 
telephone, to identify the issues in dispute and prepare written 
stipulations as to those issues not in dispute. If the claimant 
submits additional evidence, the adjudication officer may refer 
the claim for further medical consultation and opinion, as 
appropriate. 

The adjudication officer will have full authority to issue a 
revised favorable decision if the evidence so warrants. This will 
ensure that allowance decisions are expedited and not delayed 
until a formal hearing before an ALJ. If the adjudication officer 
issues a favorable decision, the adjudication officer will refer 
the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment. 

The adjudication officer will consult with the ALJ during 
the course of prehearing activities, as necessary and appropriate 
to the circumstances in the claim. As a preliminary matter, the 
adjudication officer will also routinely schedule a date for the 
hearing that is a standard number of days after the hearing 
request. Standardizing the hearing date process will facilitate 
claimant understanding and reduce the possibility of non-
appearance at the hearing. It will also enable representatives to 
plan their schedules when taking on a case. The adjudication 
officer may exercise discretion in establishing an earlier or 
later hearing date depending on the individual circumstances and 
the ALJ's calendar. Electronic access to ALJs' calendars, as 
established by individual ALJs, will facilitate timely and 
appropriate scheduling of hearings. The adjudication officer will 
refer the prepared record to an ALJ only after all evidentiary 
development is complete and the claimant or a representative 
agrees that the claim is ready to be heard. 

The ALJ will retain the authority and ability to develop the 
record. However, use of an adjudication officer realigns most, if 
not all, prehearing activities so that the burden of ensuring 
their completion rests with other members of the adjudicative 
team. With completely developed claims before them, ALJs will be 
able to concentrate their efforts on conducting more hearings and 
rendering decisions faster. 



Hearing Proceedings 



The ALJ hearing will be a de novo

 proceeding in which the 
ALJ considers and weighs the evidence and reaches a new decision. 
A 

de novo

 hearing is consistent with the role of an ALJ 
envisioned under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under that 
scheme, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply an 
agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is 
not subject to advance direction and control by the agency with 
respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. ALJs 
are independent triers of fact who perform their evidentiary 
factfinding function free from agency influence. At the same 
time, the Administrative Procedure Act ensures that an ALJ's 
decision is subject to later review by the agency, thus giving 
the agency full authority over policy. Policy responsibility 
remains exclusively with the agency while the public has 
assurance that the facts are found by an official who is not 
subject to agency influence. 

A hearing before an ALJ will remain an informal adjudicatory 
proceeding as it is under the current process. The claimant will 
have the right to be represented by an attorney or a non-attorney 
with the decision regarding representation made by the claimant 
alone. An informal, nonadversarial proceeding is consistent with 
the public's strong preference for a simple, accessible hearing 
process that permits, but does not require, a representative. An 
informal process facilitates the earlier and faster resolution of 
the issues in dispute, thus promoting more timely decisions.

<TEXT>
 

As an independent factfinder in a nonadversarial proceeding, the ALJ will still have a role in protecting both SSA
interests and the claimant
s interests, particularly when the claimant is unrepresented. However, an improved initial determination process
with its focus on early and comprehensive evidentiary development, predecision notices and opportunity for personal
interviews, fully rationalized initial decisions, and prehearing analysis of contested issues should ensure that
the Agency position is fully explored and presented to the ALJ. Moreover, the primary burden of compiling an evidentiary
record will be shifted to the representative_if one is appointed_or to the claimant (when able to do so), with assistance
(when necessary) from SSA personnel. This will permit the ALJ, in most circumstances, to close the record at the conclusion
of the oral hearing, deliberate on the issues, and render prompt decisions. 

In making disability decisions, ALJs will rely on the same standards for decisionmaking that are used by the disability
claim managers and adjudication officers. Adjudication officers and other decision writers will assist ALJs in
preparing hearing decisions, using the same decision support system that supports the preparation of initial disability
determinations. A simplified disability decisional methodology, in conjunction with the use of prehearing stipulations
that frame the issues in dispute, will result in shorter, more focused hearing decisions. If the ALJ issues a favorable
decision, he or she will refer the claim to a disability claim manager to effectuate payment. 



Final Decision of the Secretary 



Under the new process, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, the claimant's next level of appeal will
be to Federal district court. A claimant's request for Appeals Council review will no longer be a prerequisite to seeking
judicial review. 

As under the current process, the Appeals Council will continue to have a role in ensuring that claims subject to judicial
review have properly prepared records and that the Federal courts only consider claims where appellate review is
warranted. Accordingly, the Appeals Council, working with Agency counsel, will evaluate all claims in which a civil
action has been filed and decide, within a fixed time limit whether it wishes to defend the ALJ's decision as the final
decision of the Secretary. If the Appeals Council reviews a claim on its own motion, it will seek voluntary remand from
the court for the purpose of affirming, reversing or remanding the ALJ's decision. The Secretary's authority for
seeking voluntary remand prior to the Secretary's filing of an answer to the civil action is currently provided for
in  205(g) of the Act. Favorable Appeals Council decisions will be returned to the disability claim manager
to effectuate payment. The number of civil actions requiring substantive action by the Appeals Council will be relatively
small because, in the new process, ALJ decisions will be the result of a fully developed evidentiary record where the
factual and legal issues have been focused for final resolution. 

Additionally, the Appeals Council will have a role in a comprehensive quality assurance system. As part of the in-line
review component of this system, which is described in greater detail below, the Appeals Council will conduct its
own motion reviews of ALJ decisions (both allowances and denials) and dismissals prior to effectuation. If the Appeals
Council decides to review a claim on its own motion, the Appeals Council may affirm, reverse or remand the ALJ's decision,
or vacate the dismissal. The Appeals Council's review will be limited to the record that was before the ALJ. 

The Agency will establish appropriate mechanisms to respond to claimant allegations of ALJ misconduct or bias. To
the extent that the allegations of ALJ misconduct may affect the final decision in a claim, the Agency will consider
whether an appropriate mechanism includes some form of final Agency review at the claimant's request. 



Quality Assurance 



System of Agency Accountability 



SSA will be accountable to the public, the ultimate judge of the quality of SSA service, and will strive to consistently
meet or exceed the public's expectations. SSA will have a comprehensive quality assurance program that defines its
quality standards, continually communicates them to employees in a clear and consistent manner, and provides employees
with the means to achieve them. 

The quality assurance program will have three primary components: 1) substantial resources to ensure that the right
decision is made the first time; 2) comprehensive and systematic reviews of the quality of the decisionmaking process
at all levels; and 3) measures of customer satisfaction against the SSA standards for service. 



Investment in Employees 



SSA's ability to ensure that the right decision is made the first time depends on a well-trained, skilled, and highly
motivated workforce that has the program tools and technological support to issue quality decisions. 

SSA will make an investment in comprehensive employee training to ensure that all employees have the necessary knowledge
and skills to perform the duties of their positions. SSA will develop national training programs for initial job training
and orientation as well as continuing education to maintain job knowledge and skills. Such training will include
general communication skills and how to deal effectively with the public generally, and disability claimants in
particular. National training programs will also address changes to program policy. Consistent program policy
training will be provided to disability decisionmakers at all levels of the process.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940919-2-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to initial program training, continuing education opportunities will be made available to employees
to enhance current performance or career development. These opportunities may be in the form of self-help instruction
packages, videotapes, satellite broadcasts, or non-SSA training or educational opportunities. SSA will ensure
that employees are given sufficient time and opportunity to complete the required continuing education. Employee
feedback on the value of these continuing education opportunities, including the quality of training materials,
methods, and instructors, will be used to continually improve training programs. 

In addition to formal program training, SSA will rely on a targeted system of in-line quality reviews and monitoring
of adjudicative practices for all employees. The elements include a mentoring process for new employees, peer review
for experienced employees and management oversight at key points in the adjudicative process. SSA will create mechanisms
that facilitate peer discussions of difficult claims or issues. Quality reviewers and policy makers will participate
in these types of discussions. Peer reviews and mentoring will not only promote timely and accurate development of
disability claims, but will also foster a spirit of teamwork. They will also promote earlier identification and resolution
of problems with policy or procedures. Managers will be expected to oversee the adjudication process. They will conduct
spot checks at key points in the adjudication process or perform special reviews based on profiles of error-prone
claims. The goal of these reviews is to provide immediate, constructive feedback on identified errors to reduce or
eliminate their possible recurrence. Payment errors on claims detected during in-line reviews will be corrected
before a claimant is notified of the decision. 

As noted previously, under the Administrative Procedure Act, the ALJ is an independent decisionmaker who must apply
an agency's governing statute, regulations and policies, but who is not subject to advance direction and control
by the agency with respect to the decisional outcome in any individual claim. Accordingly, a system of peer review,
mentoring and management oversight in advance of the ALJ's decisionmaking is inappropriate. However, the ALJ decision
may be subject to final agency review. Therefore, as part of the in-line quality assurance process, ALJ decisions
(both allowances and denials) and dismissals will be subject to review by the Appeals Council on its own motion prior
to effectuation of the ALJ's decision or dismissal. 

Several key features previously described in this plan are critical to ensuring that adjudicators have the necessary
program tools to issue accurate decisions. A single presentation of all substantive policies used in determining
eligibility for benefits must be in place. Additionally, an automated and integrated claim processing system will
provide the necessary technological support for adjudicators at all levels of the administrative process. Expert
systems will be developed to integrate disability policy into the claim processing system. Among other things, the
claim processing system will facilitate claims taking, evidence development, and the preparation of accurate notices
and decisions by providing on-line editing capacity to identify errors in advance and decision support software
to assist in analysis and decisionmaking. The processing system will help to identify errors of both procedure and
substance, and also support routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An on-line technical review
will occur each time information is added to the electronic record. 

Comprehensive employee education and an in-line review system will build quality into the system of adjudication
with the goal of error prevention. SSA must monitor that quality on a systematic, national basis. Accordingly, all
employees (including ALJs) will be subject to and receive continuous feedback from comprehensive end-of-line reviews
as described in the following section. 



End-of-Line Reviews 



A second necessary component of quality assurance is an integrated system of national postadjudicative monitoring
to ensure the integrity of the administrative process and to promote national uniformity in the adjudication of disability
claims at all levels of the process. This system of quality measurement will include comprehensive reviews of the
whole adjudicatory process. At a minimum, a comprehensive end-of-line quality measurement system must: be statistically
valid; review both allowances and denials in equal proportion; review the entire disability claim process, both
the medical and nonmedical aspects; and review claims decided at all levels of the adjudicatory process. 

These end-of-line reviews will focus on whether correct decisions were made at the earliest possible point in the
process. This type of review will not be aimed at correcting errors in individual claims but, rather, will be the means
to oversee, monitor and provide feedback on the application of Agency policies at all levels of decisionmaking. However,
erroneous decisions detected during end-of-line reviews will be subject to existing reopening regulations. Reliance
on an integrated claim processing system will facilitate the selection of a statistically valid sample of claims
at all levels of the process for this review. 

An integrated claim processing system will permit the selection of other postadjudicative samples of claims as SSA
deems necessary to effectively test new operational procedures or monitor specific procedures in the administrative
process; oversee the implementation of new program policy regulations and initiatives; and monitor both internal
and external claims development practices to prevent fraud. 

SSA will use the results from these end-of-line reviews to identify areas for improvement in policies, processes
or employee education and training. SSA will also use the results to profile error-prone claims with the goal of preventing
errors at the front end. 



Customer Satisfaction Surveys 



A final component of quality assurance is measuring customer satisfaction. To measure whether SSA has met or exceeded
the public's service expectations, SSA must measure the public's level of satisfaction with the level of service
SSA provides. Customer surveys (including feedback cards) and periodic focus groups will be the most frequently
used methods of determining the public's views on the quality of SSA service. SSA will also survey representatives
and third parties who provide assistance or act on claimants' behalf in dealing with SSA. Survey results will be communicated
to staff on a timely basis, both as Agency feedback and individual feedback, along with any plans to address identified
problems.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940919-2-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

SSA will also seek employee feedback on how well SSA has met their expectations. Employee feedback will be sought on
a wide array of issues including Agency goals and performance indicators, training and mentoring needs, and the quality
of operating instructions. Although formal mechanisms will be used to obtain feedback periodically, each employee
will be encouraged to provide continuous feedback on how to make improvements in the process.



Measurements and Management Information


Service Perspective


SSA's measures of performances will be revised to assess the performance of the Agency as a whole in providing service
to claimants for disability benefits. Management information regarding the contributions at each step in the process
to the final product, as well as to the work product passed on to other steps will be available. For example, current
component processing time measures will be replaced by a measure of time from the first point of contact with SSA until
final claimant notification. Meaningful, timely management information will be facilitated by a seamless claim
processing system with a common database that is used by all individuals who contribute to each step in the process.

Other measures, such as cost, productivity, pending workload, and accuracy will be developed or revised to assess
the performance of the Agency as a whole and the participants in the process who contribute to this performance. Measurements
for public awareness, as well as claimant and employee satisfaction, will add to this assessment.

Management information will be current and accessible from an intelligent workstation. In addition to routine,
published national reports generated from the management information system, other reports needed by national
or local entities, or individual employees will be preformatted and system-generated on demand. Managers and employees
will have the flexibility to change parameters and to access the full data base, permitting comparisons of performance
and trends analysis. The management information system will also permit customized, ad hoc reports for special studies
or immediate special purpose activities with access to the full data base. Tools including user-friendly report
generator software and statistical forecasting and modeling applications will be available on the intelligent
workstation to assist users in the data analysis.



New Process Enablers



Reengineering is dependent on a number of key factors that provide the framework for the new process design. Each of
these ``enablers'' is an essential element in the new disability process.



Process Unification



Under the Social Security Act, the Secretary is granted broad authority to promulgate regulations to govern the disability
determination process. In addition to regulations, SSA publishes: 1) Social Security Rulings, which are precedential
court decisions and policy statements or interpretations that SSA has adopted as binding policy, and 2) Acquiescence
Rulings, which explain how a decision by a U.S. Court of Appeals will be applied when the court's holding is at variance
with the Agency's interpretation of a provision of the statute or regulations. ALJs and the Appeals Council rely on
the regulations and rulings in making disability decisions. However, guidance for decisionmakers at the initial
and reconsideration levels is provided in a series of administrative publications, including: 1) the Program Operations
Manual System instructions which provide the substance of the statute, regulations, and rulings in a structured
format and 2) other administrative issuances which clarify or elaborate specific policy issues. The use of different
source documents by adjudicators fosters the perception that different policy standards are being applied at different
levels of decisionmaking in the disability claim process.

To ensure that SSA provides consistent direction to all adjudicators regarding the standards for decisionmaking,
SSA will develop a single presentation of all substantive policies used in the determination of eligibility for benefits.
These policies will be published in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act and all decisionmakers will
be bound by these same policies.



Public and Professional Education



Public and professional education is essential to ensure that individuals and other groups involved in the disability
process have a proper understanding of SSA disability programs, their medical and nonmedical requirements, and
the nature of the decisionmaking process.

SSA will make information widely available for the general population with the goal of reducing general inquiries
from members of the public unfamiliar with SSA disability programs and increasing the number of claimants who enter
the disability process knowledgeable and prepared to assume responsibility for pursuing their claims. Pamphlets,
factsheets, posters, videos, information on diskettes and on computer bulletin board systems will be developed
and presented in a simple, straightforward and understandable manner. Information will be available in many languages
and dialects and will accommodate vision and hearing impaired individuals.

SSA will work with national and local groups involved in the disability programs to develop direct lines of communications.
These efforts will be aimed not only at providing information but also at creating ongoing organizational relationships
to maintain a dialogue about the disability process.

SSA will also conduct educational outreach with the medical community to provide them with a better understanding
of the SSA disability programs, the medical and functional requirements for eligibility, and the best ways to provide
medical information needed for decisionmaking. In addition to the use of printed materials, SSA will arrange briefings
and training sessions in association with medical organizations and societies at the local, State and national levels,
as well as through hospital staff meetings. Those medical providers who conduct consultative examinations for SSA
will need ongoing training regarding changes in the disability program. SSA will prepare training programs for this
audience which will utilize written, audiotape, videotape, and computerized training methods.

SSA will conduct outreach efforts with the legal community, to ensure that information about the disability programs
is widely available to the organized bar and the Federal judiciary. Policy documents, regularly updated electronically,
and rules of representation will be available at forums sponsored by the organized bar and in initial orientation
and continuing legal education programs designed for Federal judges.

Claimant Partnership



SSA's interaction with claimants will focus on enabling their participation in the process. SSA will also work with
third parties, such as family members and community-based organizations, to provide additional claimant support.

Understandable public information materials and comprehensive information packets will be widely available.
Explanations of the programs, the decisionmaking process, and claimant responsibilities will be widely available
and furnished at the point individuals first make contact with SSA. Claimants, who are able to do so, will be asked to
do more to facilitate development of supporting information, particularly with respect to medical evidence. To
encourage the release of evidence by treating medical sources, SSA will network with the treating source community
to overcome the lack of understanding and possible resistance to providing patient information. SSA will encourage
private insurers and public agencies that refer claimants to SSA as a condition of receiving other benefits to provide
medical evidence for these individuals.

SSA will develop ongoing relationships with community organizations to ensure that competent third-party resources
are available to assist the claimants. Examples of resources that SSA will help develop include: transportation
and escort services for indigent claimants and those who experience difficulty in getting to consultative examinations;
enhancement of medical provider capacity to identify potentially eligible patients, secure claims and provide
medical evidence; and software with compatible format design which will allow direct input of claim-related information
to SSA. SSA will have an ongoing demonstration program that provides funds for truly innovative projects that test
models for national implementation. 

In order to expedite the referral of potentially eligible individuals, SSA will develop productive working relationships
with Federal, State and local programs that serve individuals with disabilities. Other programs will be able to use
SSA-developed decisional support systems to evaluate potentially eligible persons prior to referral and to transfer
information to SSA through compatible databases. Local managers will be encouraged to develop and maintain appropriate
working relationships with local Federal, State and third-party resources.

Active participation by claimants, supported by SSA's efforts and the contributions of third parties will result
in a fundamental shift in claimant expectations and satisfaction with the SSA disability process. From the SSA perspective,
the results will be better service to customers through timely, fully supported decisions rendered at all decisional
levels; better use of SSA resources focused on helping those who need assistance; and greater public confidence in
the disability adjudication process.



Workforce Maximization



Teamwork and workforce empowerment are fundamental ingredients in the new process. In carrying out their duties
and responsibilities, adjudicators will work in a team environment with internal medical and nonmedical experts,
who provide advice and assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as with technical and other clerical personnel
who may handle more routine aspects of case development and payment effectuation. The disability claim manager will
be the focal point at the initial claim level, assisted by technical and medical support staff. The adjudication officer
will be the focal point at the prehearing level, relying on technical and medical support staff, as well as interacting
with the disability claim manager and the ALJ, as necessary. The ALJ will be the focal point at the hearing level, receiving
support from technical and medical support staff, and also interacting with the adjudication officer and disability
claim manager, as necessary.

Each team member will have at least a basic familiarity with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how
he/she complements another's efforts. Team members will be knowledgeable but will also be able to draw upon each other's
expertise on complex issues. Communication among team members will encourage consistent application of disability
policy. Improved automated systems will enable members of the team to work together using a shared data base even when
they are not co-located. Handoffs, rework, and non-value steps will be significantly reduced and fewer employees
will be involved in shepherding each claim through the process.

Employees will perform multiple tasks instead of singular activities, thus their roles will expand to encompass
more of the ``whole'' job. This will enable employees to experience the direct relationship between their actions
and the final product. Adequate resources and sufficient training and mentoring will allow employees to acquire
the skills they need to process claims from intake through adjudication. Employees will feel more of a sense of ownership
for the services they perform as a member of a team focused on serving claimants.

The new process will rely heavily on increased employee empowerment, applying information technology and using
professional judgment to complete tasks more effectively and efficiently without constant checking, direction
and micro-management. Recognition and reward processes will be revised to emphasize contributions to team outcomes
and acquisition of knowledge bases. Continuous quality improvement activities will foster ongoing incremental
process change.



Representatives: New Rules and Standards of Conduct



The Social Security Act and regulations have long recognized the representational rights of claimants and have provided
an administrative framework designed to ensure that claimants will have access to the legal community and others
in the pursuit of their claims. Representatives currently have the option for authorization of fees through two procedures:
1) the fee petition method, whereby the representative presents an itemization of services rendered and time expended,
and SSA determines a reasonable fee; and 2) the fee agreement method, whereby the claimant and representative agree
to a fee of 25 percent of the retroactive benefits due or $4,000, whichever is less.

Focus groups of claimants and the general public have indicated that the disability program is too complex to understand
and the process too fragmented and difficult for them to navigate alone. While many claimants resent having to pay
a representative to establish entitlement to government-sponsored benefits, they feel that they have no choice
if they want to be successful in this pursuit. Although the current regulations provide protection for claimants
from fee abuses, these rules fall short of assuring claimants that the representatives they retain are qualified
and will adequately represent their interests.

<TEXT>
 

In the new process, SSA will continue to have a 
responsibility for monitoring representational activity and for 
safeguarding the interests of claimants. The new process will 
establish rules of representation and standards of conduct to 
ensure that representatives fulfill their responsibilities and 
serve the needs of the claimants they represent. These new rules 
will, among other things, ensure that claimants receive competent 
representation; establish a code of professional conduct for 
representatives in all matters before SSA; and provide sanctions 
against representatives, including suspension and 
disqualification from appearing before the Agency in a 
representative capacity, for violating the rules of 
representation and standards of conduct. Without disturbing the 
statutory intent of facilitating claimant access to 
representatives, the simplified and user-friendly new process may 
well result in more claimants pursuing their claims without 
representation. However, the issue of representation will remain 
a matter of a claimant's personal choice. The new rules and 
standards of conduct provide the framework for assuring that 
representatives claimants retain will be qualified, will have the 
obligation to fully develop the record on their behalf, will 
adequately represent their interests, and will be accountable for 
misconduct or dereliction of duty. 
SSA will also conduct outreach efforts with the legal 
community, to ensure that information about the disability 
programs is widely available to the organized bar and the Federal 
judiciary. Policy documents, regularly updated electronically, 
and rules of representation will be available at forums sponsored 
by the organized bar and in initial orientation and continuing 
legal education programs designed for Federal judges. 


Information Technology 


Information technology will be a vital element in the new 
disability claim process. To the fullest extent possible, SSA 
will take advantage of the ``Information Highway'' and those 
technological advances that can improve the disability process 
and help provide world-class service. The new process will rely 
on seamless, electronic processing of disability claims from the 
first contact with the claimant to the final decision, including 
all levels of administrative appeal. Existing Agency design plans 
for Intelligent Workstation/Local Area Network (IWS/LAN) and a 
Modernized Disability System will provide an integrated system 
and the electronic connectivity necessary to support the new 
disability process. 
In a seamless electronic environment, all employees will use 
the same hardware, the same claim assignment and scheduling 
software, the same decision support software, the same case 
control system, the same fiscal and accounting software, the same 
integrated quality assurance functionality, and the same 
management information system throughout all stages of the 
process. In this environment, data will need to be input and 
validated once and multiple employees may access a single claim 
record simultaneously. 
Information technology will be applied to enhance access to 
services by claimants, their representatives, and other third 
parties. Claimants will be able to conduct business with SSA via 
telephone, self-help workstations, kiosks, videoconferencing, and 
electronic data transfer at SSA facilities and other satellite 
locations. SSA will conduct forums and produce video and 
computer-based training materials for third parties who wish to 
participate in assisting claimants to file applications and 
gather medical evidence. Wherever possible, physicians and health 
care organizations, advocates, community counseling services, and 
other professionals who regularly provide assistance to SSA 
claimants will be supplied with SSA software to electronically 
complete Agency forms. Data will be transferred to SSA using 
agreed upon methods. SSA will allow authorized representatives 
appropriate access to electronic claim folders. Paper versions of 
treating source forms will be designed so that the data can be 
read by scanning equipment into SSA claim processing systems. A 
single vendor payment system will be used to pay certain evidence 
providers for information which they provide SSA. To further 
paperless processing, SSA will adopt a ``signature on file'' policy 
for the claimant's evidence release authorization to eliminate 
routing of paper medical release forms.

The ability of decisionmakers to conduct thorough interviews 
and evidence evaluation, and timely and accurate claim 
adjudication is predicated on the implementation of the 
functionality provided by the IWS/LAN hardware and software 
components, and the decision support features of the Modernized 
Disability System. Expert system software will be included in SSA 
claim processing systems to assist disability decisionmakers in 
the analysis and evaluation of complex eligibility factors, and 
to ensure that the correct procedures for disability evaluation 
are followed. While conducting interviews, disability 
decisionmakers will rely on decision support features that ask 
impairment-specific questions. The decision support system will 
use the accumulated data of the electronic record to assist in 
the preparation of the predecision notice, the statement of the 
claim, and decisions rendered on appeal. Where disability 
decision team members cannot be physically co-located, they can 
remain in communication by using two-way TV and other 
videoconferencing technologies. Disability policy will be 
developed and stored in a format that can be integrated into 
computer systems as the source of context-sensitive help screens 
and decision-support messages. 
Quality assurance features fully supported by the Modernized 
Disability System will be integrated throughout the new process. 
For example, the national end-of-line quality review sample will 
be electronically selected and automatically routed to 
appropriate staff. In-line programmatic quality assurance, 
enhanced by the use of decision support systems, will be 
programmed into the computer applications and will help to 
identify errors of both oversight and substance, and also support 
routine analysis to aid in avoiding future similar errors. An 
on-line technical review will occur each time information is 
added to the electronic record. 
Quality assurance and productivity measures will be 
incorporated in a new, total-process management information 
system. Meaningful, timely management information for the 
disability process is dependent on a seamless data processing 
system used by all components which affords a common case control 
system and a common data base. SSA's claim processing systems 
integrated on an Agency-wide IWS/LAN platform will provide this 
seamless environment. 


Cost and Benefits 


Introduction 


SSA's strategy of coming to closure on an ideal, high-level 
disability process design before undertaking detailed operational 
and implementation planning has been consistent from the 
beginning of the reengineering project. Although this project 
management approach served SSA well, it has made the very 
necessary task of cost/benefit projections unusually challenging. 
The following cost/benefit forecasts will need to evolve as 
implementation details are developed. The administrative cost 
numbers presented here cannot be applied to SSA's administrative 
budget without further analysis. 
SSA will move forward on all aspects of the process redesign 
plan; however, because of the extensive research and development 
required for implementation of the simplified disability 
determination methodology, we have not considered the effect of 
this redesign feature in our cost/benefit planning. In addition, 
because the ability of a single employee to master the disability 
claim manager position is dependent on full adoption of a 
simplified disability determination methodology, the impact from 
that process redesign feature has also been separated out from 
our cost/benefit planning at this time. 


Service Improvements 


Service to the public, as defined by average processing 
time, would improve dramatically_from around 150 days to pay an 
initial disability claim today to 60 days after implementation of 
the new process. Hearing processing time would also improve from 
about 550 days to 225 days. These figures were derived from 
running a computer simulation model of the new process. 


Program Costs 


Under the supposition that SSA's current initial claim and 
administrative appeal process leads to correct disability 
determinations within the proper universe of people today, and 
because SSA is not proposing any changes in the statutory 
definition of disability, the redesigned process in and of itself 
would have no long-term effect on program outlays. 


Administrative Costs and Savings 


The project life period for implementing disability 
reengineering is from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 2000. 
However, the full benefits from the redesigned process will not 
be realized until September 30, 2001. 
Cumulative administrative costs during the life of the 
project are estimated at $148 million. The largest percentage of 
these costs will be directed to special workforce training on the 
new process_a critical enabler if the redesign plan is to work. 
The redesign will not require additional investments in 
information technology spending over current SSA plans. 
Cumulative administrative savings through FY 2001 are 
estimated at $852 million. The bulk of these savings will come 
from more efficient use of Federal and State workyears to process 
the anticipated disability initial claim and appeal workloads 
during the project life period. This savings estimate does not 
factor in Agency resource needs for working existing backlogged 
disability cases. 
Subtracting cumulative administrative costs of $148 million 
from cumulative savings of $852 million will result in a pay back 
to the government of $704 million through FY 2001. 
Ongoing administrative cost savings will be over $305 
million annually, beginning in FY 2001. This figure includes 
spending increases for enhanced employee education, better office 
security, and expanded claimant services. 
The administrative cost savings associated with this 
project_$704 million during the implementation period, and $305 
million annually, thereafter_will allow the Agency to reallocate 
existing resources to give more attention to other important 
workloads. 
SSA's workforce profile, with respect to disability process 
workloads, would include at least the same number of professional 
positions currently employed at the federal and state level. 
However, the overall design, if fully implemented with all the 
process enablers_especially enhanced automation_would require 
fewer clerical and support positions to handle projected 
workloads. 


Conclusion 


SSA is committed to implementing a new disability 
determination process that will deliver significantly improved 
service to the public, remain neutral with respect to program 
dollar outlays, and will be more efficient to administer. 

Administrative cost savings from the process will allow the 
Agency to reallocate resources to give increased attention to 
other important workloads. 

However, the redesigned process cannot be implemented 
without the full funding, development, and installation of a new 
case processing computer system. In addition, unless SSA invests 
substantially more funds for research and development of the 
simplified disability determination methodology, the full 
benefits of the redesigned process_including better public 
service and the potential for even greater long-term 
administrative efficiencies_will not be possible.

Overview


The disability process redesign is a high-level process description that provides a broad vision of how a new process
would work but leaves operational, organizational, and other details for later development and implementation.
SSA must now begin to transition from the high-level analysis into this latter phase. As SSA implements the new process,
the five objectives of the redesign effort must continually be kept in the forefront of implementation planning,
execution and assessment: the process will be user-friendly for claimants and those who assist them; the right decision
will be made the first time; decisions will be made and effectuated quickly; the process will be efficient; and the
new process will provide employees with a satisfying work environment. The success of the new process must be measured
against these objectives and emphasis must continually be on overall measurement from the customer's perspective,
and not individual component results. Implementing a process of the magnitude of the new disability claim process
will require a strategy that is comprehensive, creative, and inclusive. The following provides a general framework
for how implementation activity will proceed.


Implementation Framework


Planning for the implementation of the new process vision requires a comprehensive approach that moves forward on
multiple fronts simultaneously. Although the new process will not be fully implemented until FY 2001, SSA must start
on October 1, 1994 (the beginning of FY 1995), to initiate activities, changes and improvements that will establish
the plan and pace for the long-term full implementation of the new process. The goal is to make near-term, visible improvements
while at the same time building for long-term results.


Multiple Track Approach


Immediate or near-term implementation activities are those that can begin in FY 1995 and will be fully implemented
nationwide by the end of FY 1996, or for which the research and development or site testing can be initiated within the
next two fiscal years. These activities include streamlining and simplification initiatives or other procedural
elements of the new process that can be implemented using existing administrative or regulatory discretion. They
also include client-service activities associated with improving the claimant's access and entry into the disability
claim process; the development and site testing of options for streamlining parts of the administrative appeals
process; the provision of consistent training and direction to disability decisionmakers; and the establishment
of new measures and the testing of new quality assurance mechanisms. Additionally, because the decision methodology
associated with the new process depends on significant amounts of research, consultation, development and refinement,
SSA must identify the specific research needs, develop the appropriate scope of work and award research contracts
as near-term activities.
Long-range implementation items are those requiring extensive research and development that could not be tested
fully before FY 1999 or could not be fully implemented nationwide before FY 2001. These activities are those associated
with the full development, testing and refinement of a new decision methodology. They also include the implementation
of advanced technology enhancements that provide a single, fully-integrated disability claim processing system
which supports paperless claim processing and provides interactive capabilities for claimants and those who assist
them, and for providers of evidentiary information.
The remaining mid-term items or activities are those elements of the new process that can be developed and tested in
FYs 1997 and 1998 and/or fully implemented nationwide by FY 1998. Mid-term activities would include such items as
the phased testing and implementation of new service options; full development, testing and implementation of a
streamlined appeals process; the testing of more advanced technology enhancements; and the activities associated
with developing the decision methodology based on the results of research efforts completed by the end of the near
term.

Flexibility and Testing


SSA recognizes that full implementation of the new process 
vision is an iterative process that requires development, 
testing, additional information gathering and possible 
modification of process changes as they are implemented. Although 
SSA is committed to moving forward quickly to begin implementing 
the new process, SSA has embraced an equally strong commitment to 
rigorous testing and refinement of process changes before they 
are fully or permanently implemented. Testing may include, but is 
not limited to, geographic or time-limited site testing, using 
``laboratory'' settings, or relying on specific case studies. 
Formalized testing is most appropriate for process changes that 
depend on longer-term research and development, phased 
implementation or major organizational change. In selecting sites 
for initial implementation activity, SSA will take advantage of 
the interest and capability of different offices, states, or 
regions to demonstrate the viability of immediate improvements or 
identify early successes in improved service or efficiency. 
Implementation sites will, of course, be provided with the 
necessary resources to support their efforts.
Even with extensive testing, the nature of public policy 
formulation, as well as sound management principles, dictate that 
SSA remain flexible in developing, refining and implementing the 
specific elements of the new process vision. Ultimately, if the 
results of the iterative process necessitate modifications to the 
process vision, SSA is prepared to make those modifications. SSA 
is committed to change, not for its own sake, but because it is 
necessary to meet present and future challenges as it strives to 
provide high-quality, responsive, world-class service to its 
customers.

Employees Will Make Change Happen 


Overall leadership, control, and coordination of all implementation activities are vested in the Implementation
Manager, who will report to the Commissioner and Principal Deputy Commissioner. As part of these responsibilities,
the Implementation Manager, with the assistance of a support team, will establish implementation priorities, develop
specific timelines, and provide oversight to ensure that implementation decisions are consistent with the new process
visions and the five process objectives.

Although the Implementation Manager will be the focal point for all implementation activities, it is the employees
and organizational components in the SSA and DDS communities who will make the new disability claim process a reality.
Front-line employees will be asked to directly participate in the development, testing and implementation of process
changes. They will also provide feedback on the effectiveness of the these changes. Task management teams will be
chartered to address specific implementation issues and their duration will depend on the nature of their issue.
For example, task teams that might be expected to require a longer-term existence are those dealing with decision
methodology or organizational readiness and change management. The task teams will bring together staff from the
affected SSA and DDS components to provide the necessary guidance for actual implementation action by organizational
components. Central office components, working with their Regional office counterparts, will be responsible for
ensuring that necessary implementation actions are effectuated. 
SSA will rely on an internal Advisory Group, comprised of SSA executives and union and association leaders to provide
advice and guidance on implementation activities and facilitate communication about implementation plans. 


Non-SSA Experts and Interested Parties 


SSA will use an inclusive process that seeks input from a variety of non-SSA communities including, but not limited
to, disability advocates, physicians, other health care and rehabilitation providers, and the private disability
and health insurers. The goal of this inclusive process is to foster creative relationships with non-SSA experts
so that SSA can have access to specialized expertise and advice as implementation activities progress. 


Open Lines of Communication 


SSA's unprecedented effort to establish new and beneficial communication channels during the various phases of
the disability claim process redesign lays the groundwork for continued communication during implementation.
The internal and external contacts and the avenues of communication established during the public dialogue period
will continue and will be an integral part of the implementation process. SSA will continue open lines of communication
about implementation of the new process with individuals and organizations who have a stake in the disability process,
including front-line employees, representatives from Federal and State employee unions and associations, other
Federal agencies, the Congress, the judiciary, and disability advocates. SSA will use all appropriate avenues of
communication, including written materials, telecommunications, and personal briefings, to ensure that necessary
information about implementation activities is regularly and widely disseminated and to develop appropriate feedback
channels. Additionally, SSA will explore new opportunities and means of communicating with both internal and external
audiences to permit meaningful exchanges of information. 


Appendix I: Methodology 


Business Process Reengineering 



The Process Reengineering Program is the culmination of a rigorous SSA investigation of the reengineering efforts
and methodologies of those companies, public organizations, academic institutions, and consulting firms with
the most ``hands on'' experience in this field. The positive findings from this detailed review, combined with concerns
about existing business processes within SSA and the quality of SSA service to the public, led management to the conclusion
that a process reengineering effort was critical to the SSA objective of providing ``world-class'' administration
and service. 
Based largely on analysis of what has worked best in the private and public sectors, a customized reengineering methodology
was developed within SSA. It uses a reengineering team approach that combines a strong ``customer'' focus with classic
management analysis techniques, and computer modeling and simulation, to intensely review a single business process.
The objective is not to make small, incremental improvements in the various pieces of the process, but to redesign
it as a whole, from start to finish, so that it becomes many times more efficient and, in so doing, significantly improves
SSA service to the public. 
A senior SSA manager was selected to serve as Director of the Process Reengineering Program. The Director leads all
SSA process reengineering efforts, is the primary liaison with the Commissioner and Executive Staff, nominates
topics for examination, chairs project steering committees, and directs a small professional staff and revolving
group of managers/consultants.

SSA uses special, multi-disciplinary teams of individuals to 
conduct reengineering analyses and identify the best ways to 
redesign and significantly improve processes. Teams are comprised 
of outstanding employees, all of whom are subject matter experts 
in operational, programmatic, policy, systems, administrative, 
and other areas relevant to the business process. 
Reengineering teams focus on identifying those procedural 
and policy changes to the process that will: make it more 
claimant and service oriented; greatly increase productivity and 
process speed; take advantage of opportunities offered by new 
technology; and improve the empowerment and professional 
enrichment of the employees who are part of the process. Although 
teams follow the same basic reengineering protocol, continual 
customization is both expected and encouraged. 


Disability Process Reengineering Project 


An Executive Steering Committee was formed to meet on a 
regular basis to provide advice to the Commissioner on 
development of the disability reengineering process change 
proposal, and to ensure that support occurred at the highest 
levels of the Agency. The Executive Steering Committee 
established the following parameters and expectations for the 
project which are driven by targets set forth in the Agency 
Strategic Plan and based on percentages of service and/or 
productivity: 



Parameters and Expectations for Reengineering the Disability Determination Process (9/15/93) 


Definition of Process 



The ``process'' to be reengineered is the initial and 
administrative appeals system for determining an individual's 
entitlement to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income 
disability payments. It includes all actions from an individual's 
initial contact with SSA through payment effectuation or final 
administrative denial. The system for determining whether an 
individual continues to be entitled to receive disability 
payments is not part of this ``process.'' 
Rationale: The process to be reengineered must be defined 
broadly to increase the opportunity for improvement. The 
continuing disability review system is not included because it is 
conceptually and practically distinct from the initial disability 
determination process. 


Parameters 


Every aspect of the process except the statutory definition 
of disability, individual benefit amounts, the use of an 
administrative law judge as the presiding officer for 
administrative hearings, and vocational rehabilitation for 
beneficiaries, is within the scope of this reengineering effort. 
However, analysis and ideas for change should proceed and be 
presented on two tracks: improvements achievable without changes 
in statute or regulations and innovations that may require such 
change. 
Rationale: The timing of legislative or regulatory change is 
beyond SSA's control. Such change could not reasonably be 
expected to be implemented in less than 2 years. However, 
limiting the reengineering effort to aspects of the process not 
requiring change in statute or regulations was rejected as 
limiting too greatly the possibility of major 
improvement/innovation in the process. The two-track approach 
provides for both shorter term incremental improvements and 
longer term, more radical change. 


Expectations 


1. Unless otherwise specified here, the recommendations for 
change should be consistent with the goals and objectives set 
forth in the Agency Strategic Plan. 
2. Recommendations for change, taken as a whole, should not 
cause changes in benefit outlays unless as a necessary result of 
improvements in service, such as more timely processing and 
payment of claims. 
3. Process changes should improve service and/or 
productivity, on a combined basis, by at least 25 percent by the 
end of FY 1997 over levels projected in the FY 1994 budget (it 
would require about an additional $500 million currently to 
realize such improvement) and decisional accuracy should not 
decrease. By FY 2000 additional actions, including any necessary 
statutory and regulatory changes, should provide a further 25 
percent improvement. 
The Executive Steering Committee facilitated ongoing 
communications between components and the Team, and communicated 
the need and reason for reengineering the disability process. 
They were familiar with the current process problems and were 
kept apprised of research completed by the Team. In February, the 
Executive Steering Committee was expanded to include the 
Presidents of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
the National Federation of Federal Employees, and the National 
Treasury Employees Union locals, councils and chapters 
representing SSA employees; and the Presidents of the SSA and 
State Disability Determination Services (DDS) professional and 
management associations recognized by SSA as having an interest 
in disability issues. A list of Executive Steering Committee 
members appears at the end of this appendix. 
The 18 members of the Disability Reengineering Team, all of 
whom are SSA or State DDS employees, have varied and extensive 
backgrounds in all aspects of the disability program. A list of 
Team members appears at the end of this chapter. Team members 
attended a high quality, intensive 3-day SSA reengineering 
methodology training session, and completed extensive reading 
assignments on reengineering. Some Team members visited 
organizations who had reengineered their business processes to 
learn about successes as well as opportunities for improvement. 
The Team used the following methods to obtain the information 
necessary to develop a redesigned disability process. 


Briefings 


Members of the Team received extensive briefings from staff 
in all SSA components that work with any aspect of the disability 
process including experts in SSA policy, quality assurance, 
management information, operational, and appellate processes. Dr. 
Frank S. Bloch, Professor of Law and Director of the Clinical 
Education Center at Vanderbilt, briefed the Team on the results 
of his study comparing disability programs and processes of the 
United States, Canada, and Western Europe. His work encompasses 
eligibility requirements and program goals, benefit award 
structure and short-term benefits, administrative organization, 
and procedures for claim processing and appeals.

The Team's conducted extensive fact-finding visits and 
interviews with members of the disability community. Team members 
visited 421 locations in 33 States and conducted over 3,600 
interviews. Almost 2,900 of these involved front-line employees, 
managers and executives. The Team conducted an additional 111 
interviews by telephone. The Team also interviewed over 750 
parties external to SSA for their views. They also publicized 
surface/electronic mail addresses and fax and voice telephone 
numbers for those who were not contacted or had additional 
information to provide. 

Individuals and groups both internal and external to the 
process were interviewed for ideas about a new process. The Team 
solicited a wide spectrum of opinions about problems with the 
current disability process and directions for redesign. In 
addition to individuals in the SSA and DDS communities, the team 
talked to a wide variety of externals including physicians, 
health maintenance organizations and hospital officials, 
disability advocates, attorneys, professional association groups, 
Federal judges, other Federal agencies, and Congressional staffs. 

Prior to site visits and contacts, Team members provided 
individuals and organizations with general information about the 
reengineering effort, key research areas, and some unconventional 
ideas about the disability process so that the interviewees would 
have an opportunity to think about process issues. The Team 
encouraged interviewees to provide open and honest opinions, 
suggestions, and ideas. The interviews provided useful insights 
into the problems confronting the disability program and 
recommendations for solving these problems. 



Focus Groups 



A series of 12 focus groups were held throughout the country 
to obtain input from members of our claimant population and the 
general public regarding their experiences with and expectations 
of the SSA disability process. The focus groups provided the Team 
valuable information about claimants' expectations and 
preferences, as well as concerns about the current process. The 
following is a list of the focus group sites and composition.

Benchmarking 



``Internal benchmarking'' refers to the identification and 
understanding of site-specific best practices that currently 
exist within the Agency and is focused on the improvement and 
standardization of internal operations. The Team completed this 
phase of benchmarking by reviewing lists of sites engaging in 
``best practices'' which were submitted by various SSA components, 
and visiting or telephoning as many of these SSA and DDS offices 
as possible. 

``External benchmarking'' is essentially the same, except the 
search for best practices and proven process innovations is 
expanded to comparable companies and organizations outside of 
SSA. It is focused outside the organization and is concerned with 
the relative performance of one specific function or process. The 
table below identifies the companies/organizations the Team used 
as benchmarking partners.

Process Analysis 




The Team utilized a document prepared by the SSA Office of 
Workforce Analysis in April 1993 which outlines the ``as-is'' 
disability claim and appeal processes of SSA. The document 
contains a description of claim processing tasks performed by 
line-employees in the seven operational components that deal with 
the disability claim process. Team members also collected, 
reviewed, and researched an extensive amount of existing 
procedural guides, laws/regulations, studies conducted by 
internal and external components, processing time and quality 
management information, workflows, cost data, etc. 




Computer Modeling 




Computer models are close representations of work processes 
that, if properly constructed, allow for better understanding, 
testing or forecasting, and study. Team members worked with 
modeling professionals in SSA to build the models used to predict 
the operation of a redesigned process. A model was built to 
represent both the current and proposed processes. The model 
helped the Team assess the best features and performance of the 
new disability process; to better judge the magnitude of change 
from one process to another; and to do some ``what-if-nothing-
changes'' analysis to get a feel for the impact of inactivity. A 
summary of the model assumption and results appears in Appendix II. 




Release of Initial Team Proposal 




The product of the Team's effort was a redesign proposal 
that was presented to the Commissioner and Executive Steering 
Committee on March 31, 1994. The proposal provided the Team's 
view of the best process improvement and process innovation 
ideas. The proposal is a high-level concept that provides a broad 
understanding of how a redesigned process would work but leaves 
operational, organizational, and other details for later 
development. 


The Team distributed the proposal as widely as possible 
throughout SSA, the State DDSs, and to interested public and 
private individuals and organizations with the goal of seeking 
reactions, items of concern and additional ideas for improvement. 
Copies of a shorter 25-page version of the Proposal were 
distributed to all SSA and DDS employees in early April 1994. 
Copies of the complete 132-page Proposal and Background Report 
were also distributed to each SSA DDS facility in sufficient 
numbers to make it easily available to staff. A 30-minute 
videotape containing remarks by Commissioner Chater and a 
presentation of the proposal by members of the Reengineering Team 
was distributed for use in all SSA and DDS facilities. Group 
feedback discussions with SSA and DDS employees were held in all 
ten regions and in SSA headquarters components. A survey was 
distributed to each SSA and DDS employee to assist employees in 
providing comments. 


The Proposal and Background Report was published in the 


Federal Register

 on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18188). A 60-day 
comment period was established to invite public comment on the 
proposal. A public hearing on the proposal was held in 
Washington, DC on May 16, 1994. Team members conducted 
extensive briefings on the proposal with interested parties, 
including employee unions, professional association groups, 
disability advocates, the legal community, other Federal 
agencies, and Congressional staffs. 


During the comment period that ended on June 14, 1994, the 
Team received over 6,000 written responses from all interested 
parties. The Team reviewed and analyzed each comment received. A 
summary of the comments is included in Appendix III. In response 
to reactions received during the comment period, the Team made 
changes to the original proposal and submitted a revised proposal 
to the Commissioner and the Executive Steering Committee on 
June 30, 1994. 


After extensive consultation with the members of the 
Executive Steering Committee, SSA senior staff, representatives 
from employee unions and associations, disability advocates and 
others, the Commissioner accepted the Team's recommendations for 
a redesigned disability process.

Appendix II: Model Results 




Summary Information 




The Team worked with modeling professionals in the SSA 
Office of Workforce Analysis (OWA) to build computer 
representations of both the current and the redesigned disability 
processes. The computer model was built using FORTRAN programming 
language. Data based on assumptions, task times and lapse times 
were input into the model. In making assumptions, the team relied 
on historical data to the extent that such information was 
available. The Team also relied on an April 1993 OWA study that 
outlines the current disability claim process, including all 
administrative appeals, and describes the tasks performed by 
line-employees in the seven operational components that are 
involved with the disability claim process.

Using a computer model allowed the Team to assess the impact of changing from one process to another. Although the model
did not generate an actual visual simulation of either the current or the redesigned process, the model did generate
comparative data about the relative impact of specific features and expected performance. The sections that follow
provide key comparative information regarding overall processing times and employee work investment based on the
model results.



Overall Processing Times



Under the redesigned process, the time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a final initial decision
will be reduced from an average of 155 days (as cited in the OWA study) to less than 40 days. Available employees will
be able to process a greater number of claims and devote more time to each claimant, thus providing more personalized
service. The time from a claimant's first contact with SSA until issuance of a hearing decision will be reduced from
an average of a year and a half (as cited in the OWA study) to approximately 5 months.

Appendix III: Summary of Comments on Reengineering Proposal 



Overview 



During the comment period that began on April 1, 1994 and ended on June 14, 1994, the Team received over 6,000 written
responses from SSA and DDS employees, employee unions, professional associations, members of the public, claimant
representatives, physicians, State governors, claimant advocate groups, Federal components, and other interested
parties. Fifty-three percent of the written responses came from SSA employees, 21% came from DDS employees, and 26%
came from individuals and organizations external to the SSA/DDS community. Members of the Team read, analyzed, and
collated every one of those 6,210 comments so that no idea, reaction, or nuance would be overlooked. 

For the commenters who presented written reactions to the overall proposal, 52% were favorable to the overall concept,
39% were unfavorable, and 9% were neutral. Approximately 10% of these commenters believed no reengineering was needed.
Beyond the request for written comments, additional means of gauging reaction to the proposal were also employed:
group employee feedback discussions were held in over 80 sites across the country with almost 2,000 SSA and DDS employees
participating; a public meeting was held in Washington, D.C.; and Team members conducted briefings and spoke with
more than 3,000 individuals and organizations about the proposal during the comment period. 

There was a very mixed reaction to the proposal. Very few verbal or written responses were totally favorable or unfavorable
toward the proposal_those liking it had concerns about some elements while those generally disliking it found portions
which they believed would be improvements over the current process. Many commenters, regardless of expressing praise
or concern, addressed very limited aspects of the proposal without providing a reaction to the overall proposal.




Profile 



The comments expressed can be categorized as follows:

 


_SSA received widespread praise for taking on the task of redesigning the disability claim process. The prevalent
belief was that dramatic improvements are needed to provide better service and handle workloads more effectively.
Whether fully supporting the proposal or not, most commenters expressed concern that the system is broken and that
only radical redesign will solve the problems that currently exist. 

_The most popular concepts were (

listed from most to least frequently mentioned

):

 


 Elimination of the reconsideration step;


 The disability claim manager as single Agency point of contact in the initial claim;


 A single presentation of substantive policies for all decision makers;


 Encouragement of the claimant to be a partner in the development of the claim;


 Elimination of the mandatory Appeals Council review step;


 Increased reliance on the use of information technology;


 Increased public awareness and education about program requirements;


 Evidence development tailored to claimant circumstances;


 Disability claim managers empowered with full decisionmaking authority; and


 The general aspects of the proposed disability methodology.

 


_The greatest concerns centered around (

listed from most to least frequently mentioned

):





 Personal safety of disability claim managers;


 Ability of one person to fulfill the disability claim manager role;


 Pre-denial personal interview with disability claim manager;


 The general aspects of the proposed disability methodology;


 Encouragement of the claimant to be a partner in the development of the claim;


 The disability claim manager as single Agency point of contact in the initial claim;


 Development and use of an Index of Disabling Impairments;


 Use of standardized forms to request evidence from treating sources;


 Reliance on treating source certification of existing evidence; and


 Potential bias of disability claim managers.

 


_Many of the responses centered around how the proposal would be implemented and what organizational changes would
be needed to make the new process work. 

_There were concerns about whether the proposal would meet the objective of not increasing or decreasing program
costs with fairly divided opinions about whether the new disability methodology would allow or deny more claims than
the current methodology. Reliance on treating sources as preferred sources of medical evidence and personal bias
resulting from disability claim manager face-to-face meetings with claimants were often cited as the reason for
the belief that there will be an overall increase in allowed claims. The new four-step evaluation process was cited
as the most common reason for the belief that there will be an overall increase in denied claims.

Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Residential
Development called Bal Harbour subdivision, in Brevard County, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Gen Real Estate and Management Company (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife
Service (Service), pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, (Act) as amended. The permit
would authorize the take of the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, a threatened species,
in Brevard County, Florida, for a period of 5 years. The proposed taking is incidental to construction of 

#

60 single family homes including the necessary infrastructure on approximately 15.1 acres (Project), all of which
contains occupied Florida scrub jay habitat to be permanently altered. The Project is called Bal Harbour, and is located
along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida. 


The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no
sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. 


The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that two families currently use the suitable habitats within
the Project. The Applicant proposes to impact the territories of both families. Initial construction of roads and
utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, scrub
jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property
development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. To minimize the mitigate the impacts
of the loss of 15.1 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 30.63 acres of scrub habitat known to support
the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management endowment of $30,630 to ensure management
of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include control of invasive plant species from
the Project, and protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. 
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

Notice of Availability of the Draft Cyprus Tohono Corporation Proposed Mine Expansion Draft Environmental Impact
Statement


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of the Draft Cyprus Tohono Corporation Proposed Mine Expansion Draft Environmental Impact
Statement, Phoenix District.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, and The United States Department of the Interior Secretarial Order No. 3087, Section 5, Amendment
No. 1, The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has prepared an Environmental Impact Statement for the Cyprus Tohono Corporation's
proposed mine expansion on the Tohono O'odham Nation, Papago Indian Reservation. The proposed action (Alternate
A) consists of the conversion from in situ to open pit mining operations at Cyprus, the creation of a new overburden
storage site, and a new copper oxide ore heap leach pad. Cyprus proposes production of approximately one billion pounds
of copper during the thirteen year life of the proposal. A description of existing facilities and a detailed proposed
plan of operations is presented in the Mine Plan of Operations for Expanded Open Pit and Heap Leach Operations (Cyprus
Casa Grande Corporation 1993). The project was developed in response to three underlying needs: mining lease compliance,
continued industrial economic support for the Nation, and copper production.


Implementation of Alternative A would result in the disturbance of a total of approximately 1,660 acres, or approximately
0.06 percent of total Nation lands. Alternative A involves the development, operation, performance and maintenance
of the following major project components: open pit mine expansion, overburden disposal area, heap leach pads and
ponds, stormwater collection and recycling, processing facilities, access and service roads, support facilities,
utilities, spill prevention, health and safety plans, and reclamation and closure. There would be increases in royalties
and employment. Scholarships would be established. Each of the major project components re described in the main
body of the Draft EIS.
Alternative B was developed to minimize potential impacts to biological and visual resources. Alternative B includes
the same basic project components as Alternative A, however, some of the components would be moved south of an existing
access road. Movement of the proposed project elements south of the existing mine access road serves to limit disturbance
of natural drainages, reduce potential disturbance to bat colonies north of the site, and to provide a visual screen
of existing mine plant site structures. Alternative B would disturb a total of approximately 1,850 acres.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A limited number of copies of the EIS are available upon request to the: Phoenix District Manager, Bureau of Land Management,
2015 West Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027. There are also copies available for review at the above location.


Public meetings will be held to receive comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Location, dates, and
times of these meetings will be announced in the local media.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession
of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center.</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Park Service



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.





Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects in the possession
of the South Dakota State Archaeological Research Center, Rapid City South Dakota.
The detailed inventory and assessment of the human remains and associated funerary objects has been made by the State
Archaeological Research Center (SARC) curatorial staff, contracted specialists in physical anthropology and
archaeology, and representatives of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe,
and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
The remains of an adult and a child were recovered in 1953 from the Cottonwood Site (39HU43), in Hughes County, South
Dakota. Excavation data suggests the site was occupied by Dakota Sioux between A.D. 1867-1900. The Cottonwood
Site is located adjacent to the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials
of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which
can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.
The remains of two individuals were recovered in 1961 from Sitting Crow Mounds (39BF225), a Woodland and Historic
site in Buffalo County, South Dakota. Objects associated with the adult female and child_including rings, fragments
of fabric and metal, shoes, buttons, a toy revolver, and the remnants of coffins_help date the two burials to the Historic
Period (post 1750). Craniometric measurements are consistent with those of Sioux populations. Sitting Crow Mounds
are located adjacent to the Crow Creek (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials
of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which
can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe.
The remains of two individuals were recovered between 1966-1968 at Fort Manuel (39CO5), in Corson County, South
Dakota. The site is multicomponent, representing Extended Coalescent, historic trading post, and historic Sioux
occupations. The remains of an adult male appear to have been buried in a pit in the cellar following the 1813 abandonment
of the fort. The weathered condition of these remains is indicative of a scaffold burial with secondary interment,
a practice common among the Sioux. Osteological information indicates the child is associated with the Extended
Coalescent component of the site. However, wood fragments associated with these remains may represent remnants
of a historic period coffin. Fort Manuel is located adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Based on the above
mentioned information, officials of the SARC have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship
of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human remains and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
The remains of one individual were recovered in 1979 from the Three Horse Site (39DW35) in Dewey County, South Dakota.
The site is multicomponent, representing Archaic and historic period occupations. The remains of the adult male
were recovered from a disturbed area along a cutbank. Evaluation of the cranial morphology by K. Richard McWilliams
suggests an Archaic or earlier temporal association for the human remains. Physical anthropologists from the University
of Tennessee suggest the human remains are from a Sioux population. The Three Horse Site is located within the exterior
boundary of the Cheyenne River (Sioux) Reservation. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the SARC
have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be
reasonably traced between these human remains and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
On May 20, 1994, the above mentioned human remains and associated funerary objects were repatriated to Mr. Sebastian
LeBeau on behalf of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Cheyenne River
Sioux Tribe. Questions or concerns related to the repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects
listed in this notice can be directed to Sebastian (Bronco) LeBeau, Cultural Preservation Officer, Cheyenne River
Sioux Tribe, P.O. Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, (605) 964-4155; Michael Jandreau, Chairman, Lower
Brule Sioux Tribe, P.O. Box 187, Lower Brule, South Dakota 57548, (605)473-5561; Duane Big Eagle, Chairman,

of The Line pursuant to its filing in Docket No. AB-3 (Sub-No. 111X), 

Missouri Pac. R. Co._Aban._Osage & Morris Count., KS

, 9 I.C.C.2d 1228 (1993).

<DOCTITLE>The Indiana & Ohio Rail Corp._Continuance in Control Exemption_The Cincinnati Terminal Railway Co. </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of exemption. 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under 49 U.S.C. 10505, the Commission exempts from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343, et seq., the
Indiana & Ohio Rail Corp.'s (IORC)

1

 continuance in control of The Cincinnati Terminal Railway Co. (CTER), through ownership of all of CTER's capital
stock. CTER is a class III common carrier that operates a 16.25-mile line of railroad and associated branch and connecting
tracks known as the Oasis Line, located in Cincinnati, Fairfax, and Evendale, OH.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Near its northern end, CTER's Oasis Line connects with the Indiana & Ohio Railway Company (IORY), a wholly owned
subsidiary of IORC, and, at its northern end, with Conrail. From its northern end, the line runs in a loop south and west
through Cincinnati, OH, where it connects with a line of the Norfolk & Western Railway Company (N&W). CTER
entered into a track lease agreement with N&W.

2 

As a result, CTER connects with another carrier, the Central Railroad Company of Indiana (CIND). The Indiana and Ohio
Railroad Company (INOH), also controlled by IORC, has trackage rights over CIND.

3 

Control of CTER by IORC will permit the coordination of the operations and services of INOH, IORY, and CTER. The combined
INOH-CTER-IORY operation will provide a through connection to Conrail that will eliminate the need to rely on an intermediate
switch. 





Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To purchase a copy of the full decision, write
to, call, or pick up in person from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., Room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building,
Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available

Grant of Individual Exemptions; The Bally Manufacturing Corporation, et al. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans. 




The Bally Manufacturing Corporation, Bally's Employee Savings Trust for Administrative Employees, et al. (the
Plans), Located in Chicago, IL

Application Nos. D-9646 and D-9647] 


Exemption 


The restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application
of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to (1) the advance
of funds (the Advances) to the master trust which was established to hold the assets of the Plans (the Master Trust)
by Bally Manufacturing Corporation (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plans and the Master Trust,
and (2) the Master Trust's potential repayment of the Advances upon the receipt by the Master Trust of payments under
two guaranteed investment contracts (the GICs) issued by Executive Life Insurance Company (Executive Life); provided
the following conditions are satisfied: 
(A) No interest or expenses are paid by the Plans in connection with the transaction; 
(B) The Advances will be repaid only out of amounts paid to the Master Trust by Executive Life, its successors, or any
other responsible third party; and

(C) Repayment of the Advances is waived with respect to the amount by which the Advances exceed GIC proceeds. 


Comments 


In the Notice of Proposed Exemption, the Department invited all interested persons to submit written comments and
requests for a hearing on the exemption. All comments and requests for hearing were due by September 10, 1994. The Department
received two written comments and there were no requests for a hearing. Both commentators were in favor of the exemption
and urged the Department to allow the Employer to make the Advances so that participants could receive distribution
of their Plan benefits. 
For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on July 27, 1994 at 59 FR 38209.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Banque Paribas (the Bank) and Paribas Asset Management, Inc., (the Manager; collectively, the Applicants), 
Located, respectively, in Paris, France and 
New York, New York


[Application Nos. D-9178 and D-9179]



Proposed Exemption





The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting
from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code shall not
apply to the proposed guarantee by the Bank to an employee benefit plan that retains the Manager as investment manager
for such plan (the Plan) of the value of the Plan's principal investment with the Manager, provided that each of the
following conditions is satisfied: (1) the fiduciaries of the Plan who are responsible for the selection and retention
of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the selection of the guarantee from the Bank, are independent
of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates; (2) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other
person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates for the guarantee; (3) the Plan is entitled to cancel the
investment management agreement with the Manager, and/or the guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable
notice; (4) the Agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will be amended to provide that, for purposes
of enforcing the Bank's guarantee, the determination of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment
management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant to objective standards determined jointly by the Manager and
the Plan's custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible
for causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement; (5) however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to
agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination;
if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser
and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified
appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the Manager; and (6) the
investment management agreement between each Plan and the Manager and the Bank will provide (a) that income from any
lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account, and (b) that no
lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified person
with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81-6 (52 FR 18754, May 19, 1987)
and 82-63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982)] are satisfied. 



For purposes of this proposed exemption, the term ``affiliate'' of another person means any person directly or indirectly,
through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person, provided
that the Manager shall not be deemed an affiliate of another person solely because the Manager has investment management
authority or discretion over the assets of the other person. For purposes of the foregoing, the term ``control'' means
the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than an individual.
Further, for purposes of this proposed exemption, a Plan fiduciary shall be deemed ``independent'' of a person only
if: (1) the fiduciary is not an affiliate, as defined above, of such person; and (2) the fiduciary has no other relationship
to or interest in such persons that might affect the exercise of such fiduciary's best judgment as a fiduciary.



Summary of Facts and Representations





1. The Bank is a bank organized under the laws of the Republic of France and is a subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere de
Paribas, represented to be one of the world's leading banking and financial groups. The Bank, through its subsidiaries,
branches and offices, operates in over 60 countries, including the United States, spanning the whole range of banking
activities. The Bank's operations are structured in four principal groups: corporate banking, capital markets,
corporate advisory services, and investment management. As of December 31, 1990, the Bank's consolidated assets
totalled approximately FF 568 billion (US $111 billion), with consumer loans totalling approximately FF 176 billion
(US $34 billion) and customer deposits totalling approximately FF 228 billion (US $44 billion).



2. The Manager, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of the Bank, is responsible for defining the Bank's overall investment objectives and managing its pooled investment
products (including specialized country or regional funds, diversified growth and income funds, and fixed income
funds). Worldwide, the Manager and the Bank's institutional management team had total assets under management of
almost FF 55 billion (US $11 billion) at the 1990 year end. The Manager is a registered investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act) and, according to the Applicants, qualifies as an investment manager
under section 3(38) of the Act.

1

 The Manager's principal business activity in the United States is the provision of investment management services
for various clients, including the trustees or other fiduciaries of plans governed by the Act. The Manager currently
serves in such capacity with respect to five U.S.-based clients, including three Plans, involving approximately
US $190 million in assets under management (including approximately US $85 million of Plan assets). The investment
media in which the Manager will invest a Plan's assets is generally subject to specific investment guidelines and
restrictions prescribed by the Plan fiduciaries, but may include fixed income instruments (such as bonds, mortgage-backed
securities, Treasury bills, and commercial paper), options on fixed income securities, forward rate agreements,
floating rate notes, and currency hedging instruments. According to the applicant fixed income related instruments
are intended to be used as a hedge or as an alternative to bonds. 






3. The Manager and the Bank have entered into investment management agreements with certain non-Plan clients which
provide that the Bank will guarantee the value of the client's initial principal investment, if the client does not
cancel the agreement before the first anniversary of its effective date and not over 50 percent of such investment
has been withdrawn by that date. Mechanically, the Bank would contribute its own funds to the client's account with
the Manager, for distribution to the client, in the event the client elected to cancel the agreement or to withdraw
funds from the account at a time when the value of such account was less than the amount of the client's principal investment
therein. Such agreements terminate after one year, subject to renewal by written agreement of the parties thereto.

4. The Manager and the Bank would like to offer a similar guarantee to the Manager's Plan clients. The parties to the
investment management agreement (the Agreement) would be the Bank, the Manager, and the Plan client. Section 6.1
of the prototype Agreement provides that the Bank unconditionally guarantees the return to the client at the termination
of the Agreement of an amount equal to the amount invested by the client (the Qualifying Deposit) under the Agreement
(either initially or after the date of any renewal of the Agreement). Qualifying Deposit means any amount invested
by the client not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or,
in the case of a renewal of the Agreement, not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the
date of such renewal). However, pursuant to section 6.2 of the Agreement, the above mentioned guarantee (the Guarantee)
does not apply if the client terminates the Agreement before such first anniversary. The Guarantee does apply, however,
to any principal withdrawn by the client if (and after): (i) the credit rating assigned to the Bank's unsecured unsubordinated
debt securities by either Standard and Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is reduced below AA-
or Aa3, respectively; or (ii) the Manager or the Bank notifies the client that the Agreement will terminate prior to
its agreed upon term. There is no time period limiting the application of the Guarantee with respect to the circumstances
described in (i) and (ii), above. 


The applicant states that if a client were to deposit additional amounts under the Agreement after the date of the initial
Qualifying Deposit but before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or before the first anniversary
of any renewal of the Agreement), such additional deposits would also be guaranteed by the Bank, but such additional
deposits would be subject to the same one-year holding period requirement (measured from the date of such additional
deposit) for the Guarantee to apply.



Section 6.1 of the Agreement further provides that if, at the termination of the Agreement, the client has not received
an amount equal to its Qualifying Deposit, the Bank shall, upon written demand by the client, pay to the client the entire
unpaid principal balance of such Qualifying Deposit. This section permits the client to withdraw up to half of the
Qualifying Deposit at any time subject to two weeks advance written notice. However, if at the time of such partial
withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is lower than the Qualifying Deposit, section 6.1 of the Agreement
provides that the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal divided by the net
asset value of the portfolio at that time. If at the time of the withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is higher
than the Qualifying Deposit, the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal
divided by the Qualifying Deposit. 


The applicant has provided three examples illustrating how the Guarantee operates in the case of partial withdrawals
when the net asset value of the portfolio has (1) decreased, (2) not changed, and (3) increased. All three examples
assume a Qualifying Deposit of $20 million and a withdrawal of $10 million after the one-year period mentioned above.
In the first example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit had fallen to 
$15 million at the withdrawal date, leaving only $5 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example,
the Guarantee would be reduced by 67% (i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $15 million pre-withdrawal net asset
value at time of withdrawal). Therefore, although $5 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's
account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal, the Guarantee would apply to $6,666,667 of the Qualifying
Deposit (i.e., 33% of the $20 million Qualifying Deposit).



In the second example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit remained at $20 million at the withdrawal date,
leaving $10 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 50%
(i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $20 million pre-withdrawal net asset value at time of withdrawal). Therefore,
$10 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million
withdrawal, and the Guarantee would apply to $10 million of the Qualifying Deposit (i.e., 50% of the $20 million Qualifying
Deposit).

In the third example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit had risen to $25 million at the withdrawal date,
leaving $15 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 50%
(i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by the $20 million Qualifying Deposit). Thus, although $15 million would be
the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal,
the Guarantee would apply to $10 million of the Qualifying Deposit.
Income on the account would not be currently distributed to the client. Rather, income would be held in the account
until termination of the Agreement and may become part of a new Qualifying Deposit upon renewal of the Agreement. As
discussed above, it is anticipated most Agreements would have a renewable term of one year.
5. The applicant states that the investment management fee negotiated by the Manager with each of its clients does
not change by reason of the Bank's Guarantee. The applicant represents that the Manager offers the client two management
fees: a combined arrangement or a base fee only. The combined arrangement includes (a) a fixed fee of 0.30% per annum
of the net asset value of the client's portfolio, payable quarterly in arrears based on the net asset value of the client's
portfolio as of the end of the quarter (adjusted for additional withdrawals) and (b) a performance schedule fee equal
to 25% of an amount equal to the aggregate net realized and unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets in the
client's portfolio (including net investment income) in excess of a benchmark (the Benchmark) equal to the U.S. 3-month
Treasury bill rate plus 100 basis points.

2

 





The performance schedule fee is assessed and billed on the one-year anniversary of the date of the Agreement and at
the end of each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Agreement, which may be renewed by written agreement
of the parties. Each assessment of the performance fee is based on the performance of the client's portfolio over the
12 months ending on the last day of the period for which the fee is being paid. If the Agreement terminates at a time other
than at the end of a calendar quarter, the performance fee for such quarter is payable upon termination, based on the
performance of the client's portfolio over the 12 months ending on the termination date.

<TEXT>
 

The Benchmark is calculated using the average of the U.S. 
3-month Treasury bill rate on the first and last day of each quarter within the 12-month period in question. In calculating
the performance fee, the basis for determining the amount of appreciation is the starting value of the assets in the
client's portfolio at the beginning of the 12-month period. Every time a performance fee is paid out, the basis for
assessing the performance is adjusted to reflect the net asset value after such fee payment. According to section
4.4 of the Agreement, any underperformance in a given quarter must be made up before any new performance fees are payable.
Section 4.4 of the Agreements currently in effect with non-Plan clients states that the valuation of the performance
of the account will be provided by the Manager; however, the applicant represents that this section will be amended
to provide that the valuation of the performance of the account will be jointly determined by the Manager and the Plan's
custodian, which is the bank or other entity holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible for
causing the Plan to enter into the Agreement. The applicant further represents that, if the Manager and the Plan's
custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser
to make this determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each
select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot
agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of
the Manager.
Under the alternative arrangement, the client pays only a fixed fee equal to 0.40% per annum of the net asset value of
the portfolio, payable quarterly in arrears based on the net asset value of the portfolio as of the end of the quarter,
adjusted for additional withdrawals.
The applicant represents that the fees are disclosed in information materials furnished to the client, including
the presentation flip book and the distributors' product overview letter. The applicant represents that the Manager's
fees under the Agreement are competitive with the fees charged by competitors offering no guarantee.
6. As stated, the Manager and the Bank would like to offer the same Guarantee to the Manager's Plan clients which are
not investing in pooled funds. The Plan fiduciaries would not be required to select the Guarantee, or if selected such
fiduciaries would still retain the right to cancel the investment management agreement or the Guarantee feature
at any time upon reasonable prior notice. A Plan will be permitted to cancel the investment management agreement with
the Manager on 30 days' prior notice. In addition, a Plan will be permitted to cancel the Guarantee immediately upon
notice of cancellation being given; that is, no period of advance notice will be required for cancellation of the Guarantee.
No separate fee or remuneration would be paid by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their
affiliates for the Guarantee. The same negotiated investment management fees would be charged by the Manager whether
or not the Plan fiduciaries accept the Bank's Guarantee.
For purposes of determining when the Guarantee would be enforced, and in what amount, records will be kept by both the
Manager and the Plan's custodian. The applicant represents that the Plan's custodian has no relationship to the Bank,
the Manager, and its affiliates. The records of these two parties will be reconciled monthly. The applicant represents
that in determining the value of the Plan's account, the value of a security will initially be determined by the Plan's
custodian. The value will then be checked by the Manager using the following sources depending on the sector and the
markets in which the security is trading: the closing price shown on the Reuters and/or Bloomberg screens; or if the
security is not so displayed, mid-market prices obtained from at least two brokers with these prices then being averaged.
If the value as so determined by the Manager is not significantly different from the value determined by the Plan's
custodian, the latter value will be used. If there is a significant difference, the Manager will consult with the Plan's
custodian in order to reach a mutually agreeable valuation. Thus, the final value of the Plan's account is determined
jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian. However, it is represented that, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian
are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this
determination. If they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a
qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree,
by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers. All such appraisers will be independent of the Manager.
7. Section 7 of the Agreement currently in effect with 
non-Plan clients permits the Manager to lend the securities held in the portfolio and to receive income from this process
for its own account. However, this section also provides that any such lending by the Manager shall be entirely at the
Manager's own risk and that the Manager shall indemnify the client for any loss sustained by the portfolio as a result
of such activities. The applicant represents that this section of the Agreement will be amended to provide (a) that
income from any such lending from a Plan's account will be credited to the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account,
and (b) that no lending of this type will occur under circumstances where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified
person with respect to the Plan unless the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81-6 (52 FR 18754,
May 19, 1987) and 82-63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982, as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982) are satisfied.

8. The Applicants assert that by entering into an arrangement with the Manager and the Bank containing the proposed
Guarantee, a Plan would receive protection against the risk of any loss in the value of its investment, provided by
the proposed Guarantee, while also enjoying the benefit of potential income and gains realized by the Manager's individually
tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the investment management agreement. They represent that
these advantages are substantially similar to the benefits that may be achieved by so-called ``managed guaranteed
investment contracts'' and similar investment products currently offered by certain insurance companies and banks.
The Applicants state that since the terms and conditions of the investment management services provided by the Manager
to its clients are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Advisers Act, and since
the Bank must account for the Guarantee on its books and records in the same manner as any other Guarantee issued in the
course of its banking business subject to the regulation of the French banking authorities (as well as the regulation
of banking authorities in other countries, including the United States, in which the Bank maintains banking operations
through its subsidiaries, branches, and offices), substantial regulatory oversight exists to ensure protection
of the rights of Plans and their participants and beneficiaries with respect to the Guarantee. 
By letter dated March 23, 1992, Jean-Pierre Mattout, Head of the Bank's Legal Department, stated his opinion that
the Guarantee constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Bank. The applicant points out that as the
Bank has a branch doing business in the United States, the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United
States and a Plan could bring an action against the Bank in the courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee.
By letter dated September 15, 1993, the attorney representing the applicant with respect to the exemption application,
explains that the Guarantee, a contract right created pursuant to the Agreement, would be a client Plan asset. He states
that the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and that a plan could bring an action against
the Bank in the district courts of the United States to enforce the Guarantee. He expresses the opinion that for these
reasons, the indicia of ownership of this contract right (the Guarantee) would be maintained within the jurisdiction
of the district courts of the United States, consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 2550.404b-1.






9. Although the Applicants anticipate that the proposed Guarantee would be provided principally to plans sponsored
by major corporations, generally with assets of at least US $200 million for each such plan, the Bank and the Manager
wish to be able to offer the proposed Guarantee to any plan investing its assets with the Manager (but not investing
in pooled funds) pursuant to an investment management agreement providing for such Guarantee, but only if the plan
fiduciaries responsible for making the decisions (1) to select and retain the Manager as investment Manager, and
(2) to select the Guarantee, are independent of the Bank, the Manager, and their affiliates. The Applicants represent
that they do not presently know the identity of any plan that may select the Manager as investment manager and thereby
may receive the Guarantee from the Bank under the applicable investment management agreement. The Applicants will
bear all costs in connection with the filing of this exemption application.
10. In summary, the Applicants represent that the proposed transaction satisfies the exemption criteria set forth
in section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the proposed transaction will enable a Plan to receive protection against
the risk of any loss in the value of its investment in the Portfolio while also enjoying the benefit of potential income
and gains realized by the Manager's individually tailored, active management of the Plan assets covered by the Agreement;
(b) fiduciaries of the Plan who are independent of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates are responsible for
the selection and retention of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and for the decision to acquire the Guarantee
from the Bank; (c) no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank,
or any of their affiliates for the Guarantee; (d) the Plan is entitled to cancel the investment management agreement
with the Manager, and/or the Guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable notice; and (e) the determination
of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant
to objective standards jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian; however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian
are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this
determination; if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager and the Plan's custodian will each select a
qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree,
by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all such appraisers will be independent of the
Manager.



NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS: 

Since the identities of Plans that might select the Manager as investment manager, and thereby receive the proposed
Guarantee pursuant to the Agreement, are presently unknown, the only practicable means of notifying potential interested
persons is the publication of this notice of proposed exemption in the 

Federal Register

 and presentation of the notice to plan fiduciaries who enter into the investment management agreement. However,
the Manager represents that notice of the proposed exemption will be furnished by first class mail to all known prospective
plan clients.

3. The Notes, dated January 10, 1974, are twenty-five year promissory notes with interest accruing at a rate of 8-7/8
percent per annum. The Notes are secured by a first deed of trust on the Shopping Center which was valued at $2,200,000
as of March 1, 1994. The terms of the Notes provide that the Employer has the right to prepay the entire indebtedness
in full with a prepayment premium required only if the prepayment of the Notes is made in years eleven through twenty
of the twenty-five year term. The Employer represents that, as of February 1, 1994, the Notes were twenty-one years
old and, therefore, can be purchased by the Employer, without paying a premium, for their outstanding principal balances.
As of March 29, 1994, the outstanding principal balance of the Indianapolis Note was $152,238 and the outstanding
principal balance of the Columbus Note was $323,515. Prior to the Purchase, the Employer proposes to make a $63,966
payment towards the Indianapolis Note, thereby reducing its outstanding principal balance to $88,272 and the total
outstanding principal balances of the Notes to $411,787. 
 Mrs. and Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester (the Applicants) propose to have the Employer, acting as agent for the Accounts,
purchase the Interests for the Accounts for their outstanding principal balances on the date of the Purchase provided
that the outstanding principal balances of the Notes are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests.
The Accounts will purchase the Interests based upon the proportion of their respective accounts relative to the total
assets in the Plan. Accordingly, the Accounts will purchase the Notes in the following proportions:






Accordingly, the Applicants request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Purchase under
the terms and conditions described herein.
 

4. The Employer obtained an appraisal of the Interests dated March 29, 1994 from John R. Garvin, MAI-GRE of Continental
Appraisal Company of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Garvin represents that both he and Continental Appraisal are independent
of and unrelated to the Applicants and the Employer, although he has provided some consulting services for Mr. Chapman.
Mr. Garvin states that, on average in the past five years, he has derived less than one percent of his annual income from
the Employer and Mr. Chapman. 
 Mr. Garvin placed the fair market value of the Notes at $419,948. Such amount takes into consideration the $63,966
payment that will be made on the Indianapolis Note by the Employer. In assigning fair market values to the Interests
based upon the value of the Notes, Mr. Garvin discounted the two minority interests (Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester's
interests) by five percent to reflect their lack of liquidity. Mr. Garvin represents that because the majority interest
(Mrs. Chapman's interest) could liquidate the investment at any time without the consent of the minority interests,
there is no basis for any such discount with respect to the majority interest. The fair market values of the Interests,
as of March 29, 1994, are as follows:






Accordingly, because the outstanding balance of the Notes are less than the fair market values of the Interests, the
Accounts will purchase the Interests for their pro rata share of the outstanding balance.
 

5. The Applicants represent that the Purchase is in the best interests of the participants because it offers the Accounts
the opportunity to purchase the Interests at less than their fair market values. Also, the Purchase will allow the
Accounts to enhance their current rate of return without additional risk. The Applicants represent that the Purchase
will not involve more than twenty-five percent of the assets in each of the Accounts. The Accounts are not required
to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Purchase. 
 6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms of the Purchase will be at least as favorable to the Accounts as
those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Purchase price will be equal to the
outstanding principal balances of the Notes on the day of the Purchase; (c) the Purchase will occur only if such outstanding
principal balances are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests on the day of the Purchase
as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; (d) the Purchase will not involve more than twenty-five percent
of the assets in each of the Accounts; and (e) the Accounts will not be required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses
in connection with the Purchase.


Notice to Interested Persons
 

Because the only Plan assets involved in the proposed transaction are those in Mrs. Chapman, Mr. Chapman & Mrs.
Koester's Accounts and they are the only participants affected by the proposed transaction, it has been determined
that there is no need to distribute the notice of proposed exemption to interested persons. Comments and requests
for a hearing are due thirty days after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register.

AT&T Corporation (AT&T), and AT&T Investment Corporation (ATTIMCO), Located in New York, New York


[Application Nos. D-9716 and D-9717]



Proposed Exemption
 

The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990).



Part I_Exemption for Payment of Certain Fees to Asset Managers

 

The restrictions of section 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975 of the Code, by reason
of section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the payment of Performance Fees by an AT&T Investment
Fund to an Asset Manager in exchange for real estate management or advisory services rendered pursuant to an Agreement,
provided that the conditions set forth in Parts II and III are satisfied.



Part II_General Conditions

 

(a) The Asset Manager is not an affiliate of AT&T and the terms of any Performance Fee are approved in writing by
AT&T. 

(b) The terms of any Performance Fee shall be at least as favorable to the AT&T Investment Fund as those obtainable
in arm's-length transactions between unrelated parties.
 (c) No AT&T Trust shall allocate, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total assets to Arrangements
which are the subject of this exemption, determined at the time any such Arrangement is established and at the time
of any subsequent allocation of additional assets (including the reinvestment of assets) to such an Arrangement.
The foregoing limitation shall not apply to an AT&T Plan Assets Entity. However, that percentage of the Assets
of an AT&T Plan Assets Entity which is deemed to be ``plan assets'' of an AT&T Trust invested therein shall
be treated as assets of such AT&T Trust for the purpose of applying the foregoing limitation to the AT&T Trust.
 (d) AT&T shall receive the following written information with respect to assets subject to this exemption (Assets):
 (1) annual audited financial statements prepared by independent certified public accountants approved by AT&T;
 (2) quarterly and annual reports prepared by the Asset Manager relating to the overall financial position of the Assets
(Each such report shall include a statement regarding the amount of fees paid to the Asset Manager during the period
covered by such report); and 
 (3) annual reports indicating the fair market value of the Assets determined on the basis of the most recently available
Independent Valuations. (e) The total fees paid to an Asset Manager shall constitute no more than reasonable compensation.
 (f) The Performance Fee shall be payable after Net Proceeds with respect to the Assets exceed the Threshold Amount.
The Threshold Amount and the amount of the Performance Fee, expressed as a percentage (or percentages) of the Net Proceeds
in excess of the Threshold Amount (or Threshold Amounts), shall be established by the Agreement. The Threshold Amount
for any Performance Fee shall include at least a minimum rate of return to the AT&T Investment Fund, as described
in Part III, Section (q).
 (g) The provisions of this paragraph (g) shall apply only where an Asset Manager has discretion to sell Assets without
prior approval of AT&T. For any sale of an Asset which gives rise to the payment of a Performance Fee to an Asset Manager
prior to the Termination Date, the sales price of the Asset shall be at least equal to a Target Amount in order for the
Asset Manager to sell the Asset and receive its Performance Fee without further approval. If the proposed sales price
of the Asset is less than the applicable Target Amount, the proposed sale shall be disclosed to and subject to the approval
of AT&T, in which event the Asset Manager shall be entitled to sell the Asset and receive its Performance Fee. If
the proposed sales price is less than the applicable Target Amount and AT&T's approval is not obtained, the Asset
Manager shall retain the authority to sell the Asset, provided that the Performance Fee that would have been payable
to the Asset Manager by reason of the sale of the Asset shall be paid only at the termination of the Arrangement.
 (h) In the event of termination of the Arrangement upon its Termination Date, the Asset Manager shall be entitled to
receive a Performance Fee payable on the Termination Date. The amount of the Performance Fee upon termination shall
be determined by assuming a sale for cash of the remaining Assets at their fair market value (determined on the basis
of Independent Valuations) and no reinvestment of such cash in Assets subject to the Arrangement.
 (i) In the event of the removal or resignation of an Asset Manager prior to the Termination Date, the Asset Manager shall
be entitled to receive a Performance Fee payable on the Termination Date pursuant to this paragraph (i). The Performance
Fee shall be calculated on a preliminary basis at the time of such removal or resignation by assuming a sale for cash
of the remaining Assets at their fair market value (determined on the basis of Independent Valuations) and no reinvestment
of such cash in Assets subject to the Arrangements. As of the Termination Date, the amount so determined on a preliminary
basis shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the actual sales prices received by
the AT&T Investment Fund on disposition of all Assets sold after the date of the Asset Manager's removal or resignation
and prior to the Termination Date, and (2) in the case of Assets which have not been sold prior to the Termination Date,
the value of the Assets as of the Termination Date (determined on the basis of Independent Valuations), and the denominator
of which is the aggregate value of the Assets which was used in connection with the preliminary determination of the
Performance Fee at the time of removal or resignation, provided that this fraction shall never exceed 1.0. The resulting
amount shall be the Performance Fee payable to the Asset Manager upon the Termination Date.
 (j) AT&T shall maintain or cause to be maintained with respect to the Assets, for a period of six years, the records
necessary to enable the persons described in paragraph (k) of this Part II to determine whether the conditions of this
exemption have been met, except that (1) a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred if, due to
circumstances beyond the control of AT&T, the records are lost or destroyed prior to the end of the six-year period,
and (2) no party in interest, other than AT&T, shall be subject to the civil penalty that may be assessed under section
502(i) of the Act or to the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code if the records are not maintained or are
not available for examination as required by Part III, Section (k) below.
 (k) Notwithstanding any provisions of Section 504(a)(2) and 504(b) of the Act, the records referred to in Section
(j) of this Part II shall be unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal
business hours by:
 (1) any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service;

(2) any contributing employer to any employee benefit plan the assets of which are held in the AT&T Investment
Fund which has entered into the Arrangement or any duly authorized employee or representative of such employer;
(3) any participant or beneficiary of any employee benefit plan the assets of which are held in the AT&T Investment
Fund or any duly authorized representative of such participant or beneficiary; and
(4) nothing in this paragraph (k) shall authorize any of the persons described in subsections (2) and (3) to examine
any trade secrets of AT&T or information which is privileged or confidential.

of the application of 29 CFR 2510.3-101, but only if (1) fifty percent or more of the interests in such entity are
held by one or more AT&T Trusts, and (2) AT&T is the named fiduciary or manager of the assets of such entity.
(i) The term ``AT&T Trust'' means the AT&T Master Pension Trust or any other trust (other than an AT&T

(j) The term ``control'' means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person
other than an individual.
(k) The term ``Independent Valuations'' means valuations based on independent and objective third party sources
acceptable to AT&T (including without limitation NASDAQ, newspapers, or other general publications, or brokers
which are independent of the Asset Manager and its affiliates), or, if such sources are not available with respect
to a particular asset or at the option of AT&T, valuations conducted by an appraiser independent of the Asset Manager
and its affiliates which has been approved by AT&T; provided, however, that, solely for purposes of the reports
described in Part II, Section (d)(3) above, no such appraisal will be required with respect to any Asset if AT&T
determines, in its sole discretion, that such an appraisal is unnecessary.
(l) The term ``Net Proceeds'' means, with respect to an Arrangement, the aggregate amount of cash and other assets
(valued at fair market value as determined on the basis of Independent Valuations) which cease to be Assets which are
subject to such Arrangement, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement establishing such Arrangement.
(m) The term ``Performance Fee'' means a fee which equals a pre-specified percentage (or several pre-specified percentages)
of all Net Proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount (or several Threshold Amounts), subject to such limitations,
if any, as AT&T may approve or impose.
(n) The term ``Subsidiary'' means a corporation, partnership, or other entity of which (or in which) fifty percent
or more of
(1) the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or the total value of shares of all classes of such
corporation, 
(2) the capital interest or profits interest of such partnership, or 
(3) the beneficial interest of such other entity,



is owned directly or indirectly by AT&T Corporation or AT&T Investment Management Corporation.


(o) The term ``Target Amount'' means a value assigned to each Asset either (1) at the time the Asset becomes subject
to the Arrangement, by mutual agreement between the Asset Manager and AT&T, or (2) pursuant to an objective formula
approved by the Asset Manager and AT&T at the time the Arrangement is established. However, in no event will the
value be less than the value of the Asset at the time the Asset becomes subject to the Arrangement.
(p) The term ``Termination Date'' means the date, established in the Agreement, on which the Arrangement will terminate
by reason of the passage of time, as the same may be amended from time to time with the approval of AT&T.

(q) The term ``Threshold Amount'' means with respect to any Arrangement an amount which equals one hundred percent
of the AT&T Investment Fund's capital invested in the Assets plus a pre-specified annual compounded cumulative
rate or rates of return, each of which is at least a minimum rate of return determined as follows:
(1) A non-fixed rate which is a least equal to the rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) during the period from
the time the Assets become subject to the Arrangement until Net Proceeds equal or exceed the applicable Threshold
Amount; or
(2) a fixed rate which is at least equal to the average rate of change in the CPI over some period of time specified in the
Agreement, which shall not exceed ten years.

4. The applicants represent that under the Agreements, assets of the Funds will be managed with the investment objective
of obtaining current income and/or capital appreciation, primarily through investment directly or indirectly,
in real estate and interests in real estate, including without limitation fee simple interests, interests in partnerships
and joint ventures having an interest in real property, mortgages, options to purchase real estate, leaseholds,
leasebacks, and investments in real estate funds, real estate investment trusts or other entities with assets which
are invested, directly or indirectly, primarily in real estate. Assets potentially to be subject to the Arrangements
include the following: (a) investments selected or recommended by an asset manager after an Agreement is executed,
in accordance with investment guidelines established by the Agreement; (b) pre-identified investments which are
particular properties which have been identified by the asset manager for investment (or recommended for investment)
prior to the execution of the Agreement; (c) pre-existing assets which are already held by a Fund prior to the execution
of the Agreement; and (d) combinations of the foregoing.

5. As proposed by the applicant, the performance fee payable to an asset manager under an Agreement (the Performance
Fee) is a fee payable after net proceeds (Net Proceeds) from the assets under management pursuant to the Agreement
exceed a certain amount (the Threshold Amount).

4

 Net Proceeds, with respect to an Arrangement, are the aggregate amount of cash and other assets (valued at fair market
value on the basis of independent valuations

5

) which cease to be assets subject to the Arrangement. Each Agreement establishing an Arrangement will specifically
identify the assets to be subject to the Arrangement, and the basis upon which income and earnings on such assets will
cease, or continue, to be subject to the Arrangement. For example, the applicant represents that an Agreement might
provide that the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement plus all earnings and proceeds thereon will be reinvested
and remain subject to the Arrangement until the Termination Date, whereupon all such assets will cease to be subject
to the Arrangement. In such case, there will be no Net Proceeds during the term of the Arrangement, and therefore no
Performance Fee would be payable until the Termination Date. Alternatively, the applicant represents that an Agreement
might provide that all net income and other proceeds generated by the assets initially allocated to the Arrangement
will cease to be subject to the Arrangement and will thereby constitute Net Proceeds. In such case, Net Proceeds will
be generated as and when the initial assets generate net income or other proceeds, and a Performance Fee would be payable
once the amount of these Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount. The Threshold Amount is defined as an amount equal
to one hundred percent of the Fund's capital investment plus a pre-specified annual compounded cumulative rate or
rates of return each of which is at least a minimum rate of return as determined by a formula based on the consumer price
index, as required in Part III, Sections (q) (1) and (2) of the proposed exemption. The proposed exemption provides
that the Performance Fee is payable (a) after Net Proceeds exceed the Threshold Amount, and/or (b) on the Agreement's
termination date (the Termination Date, defined as the date on which the Arrangement will terminate by reason of the
passage of time, as the same may be amended from time to time with the approval of AT&T), either upon termination
of the Arrangement or in the event of the prior removal or resignation of an asset manager. The Performance Fee will
be equal to a pre-specified percentage, or several pre-specified percentages, of all Net Proceeds in excess of the
Threshold Amount, or Threshold Amounts, subject to such limitations as AT&T may impose. In this regard, AT&T
represents that there is a possibility that several Threshold Amounts may be established with different percentages
being utilized to determine the Performance Fee, depending upon which Threshold Amount has been exceeded. AT&T
states that this structure will allow AT&T to negotiate an arrangement on behalf of a Fund pursuant to which the
amount of the Performance Fee will increase as the level of investment performance increases. AT&T states that,
as an example, AT&T could negotiate a Performance Fee whereby an asset manager would receive ten percent of all
Net Proceeds in excess of an initial Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus an eight percent annual return),
and twenty percent of all Net Proceeds once a second Threshold Amount (e.g., all invested capital plus a twelve percent
annual return) has been achieved. Both the annual rate(s) of return used in determining the Threshold Amount(s) and
the percentage(s) used to determine the amount of the Performance Fee will be negotiated between AT&T and the
asset manager prior to the application of any Arrangement to assets under management of the asset manager.

<TEXT>
 

With respect to the determination of the Threshold Amount, each of the pre-specified rates of return will be at least
equal to a minimum rate of return as specified in Part III, Section (q) of the proposed exemption. In determining the
Threshold Amount, different assets or different groups of assets may be subject to different annual rates of return,
with the rate of return applicable to any particular asset being established by the Agreement.

6

 Net Proceeds in excess of the Funds invested capital plus the minimum return must actually be achieved (or deemed achieved
upon the Termination Date or the removal of the asset manager) in order for the Threshold Amount to be reached. The Performance
Fee payable to an asset manager may be reduced by all or a portion of any fees previously paid to the asset manager with
respect to the assets under any prior fee arrangement if and to the extent such a reduction is called for by the Agreement
and shall be subject to such other limitations as AT&T may impose.





6. As a specific provision of any Agreement which gives an asset manager complete discretion over the acquisition
and disposition of assets, AT&T will require that for any sale of an asset which causes the payment of a Performance
Fee and which occurs prior to the Termination Date, the sales price for the asset must be at least equal to a certain amount
(the Target Amount) in order for the asset manager to sell the asset and receive the Performance Fee without further
approvals. The Target Amount for each asset will be assigned either at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement,
as agreed between AT&T and the asset manager, or pursuant to an objective formula approved by AT&T and the
asset manager at the time the Arrangement is established. If the proposed sales price of the asset is less than the applicable
Target Amount, the proposed sale must be disclosed to AT&T for approval in order for the asset manager to receive
its Performance Fee as a result of the sale. If the proposed sales price is less than the applicable Target Amount and
AT&T's approval is not obtained, the asset manager will continue to have authority to sell the asset but the Performance
Fee which would have been payable to the asset manager by reason of the asset sale will be paid only at the Termination
Date. Under each Arrangement subject to the proposed exemption, all realized income on, and proceeds from the sale
of, the assets, net of expenses and reasonable reserves, will either (a) be reinvested in assets subject to the Arrangement,
if the Agreement so provides or if AT&T so determines pursuant to the Agreement, or (b) cease to be subject to the
Arrangement and thereby become Net Proceeds.
AT&T represents that the Target Amount concept provides protection for the AT&T Investment Fund to assure
that an asset manager will not sell any assets at unduly low prices to trigger immediate payment of the related performance
fee. AT&T states that this concept is intended to provide a floor on the price at which an asset can be sold and the
performance fee paid immediately without having to obtain AT&T's approval. For newly-acquired assets, the
minimum floor is deemed to be the cost of the asset; for previously acquired assets, the minimum floor amount is the
value of the asset at the time the asset becomes subject to the Arrangement, an approach which AT&T represents
to be the most logical to establish the minimum Target Amount for previously acquired assets. AT&T notes that
it has the flexibility to negotiate a higher Target Amount in any case where it believes the minimum Target Amount permitted
by the proposed exemption would be inadequate.

7. AT&T offers four hypothetical examples to illustrate the operation of the proposed exemption with respect
to the Target Amount concept. In each example, it is assumed that the asset manager has discretion to sell the relevant
asset without the prior approval of AT&T
 and that its performance fee is equal to ten percent of all Net Proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount. In each example,
the Threshold Amount at the time the relevant asset is sold is $110:







Example 1:

 AT&T and an asset manager enter into an Arrangement whereby the asset manager agrees to manage a portion of the
real estate investment of an AT&T Investment Fund, including Parcel X, a real estate investment to be acquired
by the AT&T Investment Funds at the time the Arrangement is entered into. The cost of Parcel X is $100 cash. At the
time the Arrangement is entered into, the asset manager and AT&T agree that the Target Amount shall be $100. Two
years later, the asset manager sells Parcel X for $150 without the prior approval of AT&T. Having exceeded the
Threshold Amount for the Arrangement, the asset manager is entitled to a performance fee of $4.00 (i.e., [$150 ^ $110]
 x  .10). Since the asset manager exceeded the Target Amount for Parcel X, this performance fee is payable at the
time of the sale of Parcel X. 



Example 2:

 Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that Parcel X was acquired by the AT&T Investment Fund three years prior
to the date the Arrangement was entered, that the initial cost of Parcel X was $50, and that its value at the time it becomes
subject to the Arrangement is $100. AT&T and the asset manager agree that the Target Amount is $100, the value of
Parcel X at the time it becomes subject to the Arrangement. Upon the sale of Parcel X for $150, the asset manager is entitled
to a Performance Fee of $4.00, calculated and payable in the same manner as described in Example 1.



 Example 3

: Assume the same facts as Example 2 except that the original acquisition price of Parcel X three years prior to the Arrangement
was $120. AT&T and the asset manager agree that the Target Amount is $100, the value of Parcel X at the time it becomes
subject to the Arrangement. Upon the sale of Parcel X, the asset manager is entitled to a performance fee equal to $4.00,
calculated and payable in the same manner as described in Example 1.



 Example 4:

 Assume the same facts as Example 3 except that the asset manager and AT&T agree that the Target Amount for Parcel
X is $130 and that the asset manager sells Parcel X for $125 without the prior approval of AT&T. Upon the sale of Parcel
X, the asset manager becomes entitled to a performance fee of $1.50 (i.e., [$125 ^ $110]  x  .10). However, because
AT&T did not approve the sale at a price below the Target Amount, payment of the performance fee is deferred until
the Termination Date of the Arrangement. Had AT&T approved the sale at the price below the Target Amount, the performance
fee of $1.50 would have been payable upon the sale.

8. An Arrangement will terminate upon the Termination Date set forth in the Agreement, which may be changed with the
approval of AT&T. Upon termination of an Arrangement, the assets under management will be either sold or retained
by the Fund, and the asset manager will be entitled to a Performance Fee or an additional Performance Fee if the Threshold
Amount has been reached at or before such time. In the case of any assets which are not sold upon termination of the Arrangement,
the Performance Fee will be calculated using the fair market value of such assets as determined on the basis of independent
valuations.

9. Each Arrangement will provide that the asset manager may be removed by AT&T at any time, without cause, upon
AT&T's delivery of a notice of removal to the asset manager. An asset manager may resign at any time, without cause,
upon written notice to AT&T. Upon removal or resignation of an asset manager, the asset manager will be entitled
to receive a Performance Fee if, at the time of the asset manager's removal or resignation, Net Proceeds with respect
to the assets under management would exceed an amount equal to the Threshold Amount. However, each Agreement will
provide that such a Performance Fee will not be payable until the Termination Date and shall be subject to a reduction
as determined under Part II, Section (i) of the proposed exemption. Accordingly, even if the aggregate value of the
assets under management declines after an asset manager's removal or resignation, the asset manager will still receive
a Performance Fee for the period of time that it provided services under an Arrangement if Net Proceeds, based on an
assumed sale of the assets at their fair market value, exceed an amount equal to the Threshold Amount at the time of the
asset manager's removal or resignation, subject to the calculation required under Part II, Section (i) of the proposed
exemption. The applicant represents that this provision ensures that an appropriate reduction in the Performance
Fee will be made if the aggregate value of the assets declines after the asset manager resigns or is removed.

10. No AT&T Trust will be permitted to allocate, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total assets
to Arrangements which are the subject of the proposed exemption, determined at the time any such Arrangement is established
and at the time of any subsequent allocation of additional assets, including the reinvestment of assets, to such Arrangement.
The foregoing limitation does not apply to an AT&T Plan Assets Entity, which is defined as any group trust, partnership
or other entity, the assets of which are deemed to be ``plan assets'' by reason of the application of 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101,
but only if (a) fifty percent or more of the interests in such entity are held by one or more AT&T Trusts and (b) AT&T
is the named fiduciary or manager of the assets of such entity. An AT&T Plan Assets Entity may allocate up to one
hundred percent of its asset to Arrangements subject to the proposed exemption. However, solely for determining
if an AT&T Trust satisfies the twenty percent limitation, the assets of any AT&T Plan Assets Entity in which
such AT&T Trust has an interest will be deemed to be the asset of such AT&T Trust only to the extent of such AT&&
Trust's interest in the AT&T Plan Assets Entity. As an example, the applicant explains a hypothetical situation
in which an AT&T Trust has total assets of $100 million: This AT&T Trust may allocate up to $20 million to Arrangements.
In the hypothetical example, $15 million of the AT&T Trust's assets are invested in an AT&T Plan Assets Entity
which has total assets of $30 million, fifty percent of which are allocated to Arrangements. For the purpose of determining
if the AT&T Trust satisfies the twenty percent allocation limit, $15 million of the assets of the AT&T Plan
Assets Entity, representing the AT&T Trust's investment therein, are deemed to be assets of the AT&T Trust.
Because fifty percent of the AT&T Plan Assets Entity's overall assets are allocated to Arrangements, fifty percent
(or $7.5 million) of this $15 million is deemed to be allocated to Arrangements. Thus, by virtue of its investment in
the AT&T Plan Assets Entity, the AT&T Trust is treated as having allocated $7.5 million to Arrangements.
Accordingly, in this hypothetical example, the AT&T Trust may allocate up to $12.5 million of its remaining assets
to Arrangements.

11. Throughout the term of an Arrangement, AT&T will receive quarterly and annual reports prepared by the asset
manager relating to the overall financial position of the assets under management, including a statement regarding
the amount of all fees paid to the asset manager during the period covered by the report, and annual reports indicating
the current fair market value of all assets as determined on the basis of the most recently available independent valuations,
as defined in Part III, Section (k) of the proposed exemption. AT&T will also receive annual audited financial
statements prepared by independent certified public accountants approved by AT&T, generally within ninety
days of the end of the twelve month period covered by the statement.

12. The proposed exemption requires AT&T to provide for the maintenance, for six years, of records necessary
to enable determinations of whether the conditions of the proposed exemption are satisfied. Such records must be
unconditionally available at their customary location for examination during normal business by any duly authorized
representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service, any contributing employer (or its representative)
with respect to an employee benefit plan with assets held in a Fund which has entered into an Arrangement, and any participant
or beneficiary (or his/her representative) of such a plan.

13. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (a) Each Arrangement is authorized in writing by AT&T as named fiduciary or
manager of the relevant Fund; (b) No AT&T Trust may invest, in the aggregate, more than twenty percent of its total
assets in Arrangements which are the subject of the proposed exemption; (c) AT&T will receive written reports
with respect to the condition of assets and payment of fees under the Arrangements, and will maintain accessible records
to enable determinations of whether the terms of the proposed exemption are satisfied; (d) The fees paid to an asset
manager under any Arrangement will constitute no more than reasonable compensation; (e) The timing and formula for
determining fees under the Arrangements will be established and approved by AT&T prior to a Fund's entering into
an Arrangement, and will be based on pre-specified percentages of Net Proceeds after the Fund has recovered its invested
capital plus a minimum pre-specified rate of return; (f) The terms of any Performance Fee will be at least as favorable
to the Fund as those obtainable in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties; and (g) AT&T may remove
an asset manager under an Arrangement at any time.

7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the
Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses will be
paid by the plans; (c) the Advance will be made with respect to amounts invested by the Plan in the GIC; (d) the Repayments
are restricted to the GIC Proceeds; (e) the Repayments will not exceed the total amount of the Advance; and (f) the Repayments
are waived to the extent the Advance exceeds the GIC Proceeds.

<DOCTITLE>Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (Byproduct License No. 34-19089-01); Receipt of Petition for Director's
Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Staff has received a Petition dated August 19,
1994, filed by William B. Schatz, on behalf of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (``Petitioner'' or ``NEORSD'').
The Petition requests, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206, that the NRC take action with regard to Advanced Medical Systems,
Inc. (AMS), to amend AMS's License No. 34-19089-01 to require AMS to install, maintain, and operate a radiation
alarm system on all drains at 1020 London Road, Cleveland, Ohio (AMS Facility) that lead to either sanitary or storm
sewers.
Petitioner asserts as the bases for this request that it views the quantity of cobalt-60 waste in the basement of the
AMS facility as a major threat; that the NRC admits that the existing contamination at the AMS Facility continues to
pose a risk; that the contamination that exists at the AMS Facility is estimated to be 393 curies of loose, ``talcum-like''
cobalt scattered upon the floor of the waste hold-up room in the basement; that cobalt-60 contamination was found
in the sewer line connecting the AMS Facility to the public sewer and was found in the public sewer directly under the
AMS discharge; that the NEORSD has already incurred costs of nearly $2 million addressing loose cobalt-60 contamination
at its Easterly and Southerly Wastewater treatment plants; that the NRC has been unable or unwilling to explain the
source of the cobalt-60 on the NEORSD property and unable to identify any likely sources for the cobalt-60 other than
the AMS Facility; that the quantity of cobalt-60 at the Southerly Plant exceeds that which the AMS records show was
released by AMS into the sewer system; and that License Amendment No. 10 to the original license for this site, issued
to Picker in 1962, contained a requirement for an alarm system to detect unmonitored discharges. The Petitioner states
that such an alarm system was not a condition of the subsequent AMS license despite a recommendation from Oak Ridge
Associated Universities that such an alarm system be installed along with control valves to shut off flow to the sewer
if the alarm sounds.
The Petition has been referred to the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. As
provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken with regard to the specific issue raised by the Petition
in a reasonable time.
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2110 L Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio
44081.

<DOCTITLE>Atomic Safety and Licensing Board; Hearing</DOCTITLE>



September 13, 1994.



In the Matter of: Gulf States Utilities Co., 

et al. 

River Bend Station, Unit 1.




Before Administrative Judges:




B. Paul Cotter, Jr., Chairman

Dr. Richard F. Cole

Dr. Peter S. Lam




This proceeding concerns two license amendments for the River Bend Station, a nuclear facility located in Feliciana
Parish, Louisiana. The amendments: (1) Authorize Gulf States Utilities Company to become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Entergy Corporation; and (2) designate Entergy Operations, Inc. as a new licensee to operate, manage, and maintain
River Bend.

In response to a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, 58 FR 36,423, 36,435-36 (1993), Cajun Electric Cooperative,
Inc. (Cajun) petitioned to intervene in this proceeding. On December 16, 1993, the NRC Staff issued the license amendments
requested, and on January 27, 1994 an NRC Licensing Board admitted Cajun as an intervener (LBP-94-3, 39
NRC 3). The decision to admit Cajun was subsequently affirmed by the Commission on August 24, 1994 (CLI-94-10,
39 NRC 

XX

).

Please take notice that a hearing will be conducted in this proceeding. Matters currently at issue are Cajun's contention
that the proposed license amendments may result in a reduction in the margin of safety at River Bend caused by underfunding
of the facility.

During the course of the proceeding, the Board may hold prehearing conferences, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.752, as well as
evidentiary hearing sessions, at times and places to be announced hereafter, through notices published in the 

Federal Register 

and made available at the Public Document Rooms noted below.

In accordance with 10 CFR 2.715(a), any person, not a party to the proceeding, will be permitted to submit a written
limited appearance statement setting forth his or her position on the issues. These statements, which may be submitted
at any time during the proceeding, do not constitute testimony or evidence but may assist the Board and the parties
in defining the issues to be considered. Persons desiring to submit a limited appearance statement should transmit
any such statement to the Office of the Secretary, Docketing and Service Branch, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, D.C. 20555. A copy of such statements should also be served on the Chairman of this Licensing Board. At

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3, located in New London County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to modify surveillance requirements by increasing
the acceptance criterion for the closure of the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.

The proposed change would permit Millstone Unit 3 to resume plant operation. To resume plant operations Millstone
Unit 3 must meet the operability requirements of the Technical Specifications for the MSIVs. On September 8, 1994,
during monthly testing of the ``C'' MSIV, it was determined that the MSIV was inoperable because its closure time was
determined to be greater than 5 seconds. Subsequent efforts to meet the required closure time have been unsuccessful.


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below:




* * * The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

NNECO's proposal to modify Surveillance Requirement 4.7.1.5.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 3 Technical Specifications
does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.


The increase in the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds has no adverse impact on the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis
Report] analyses for the feedwater line break and the main steam line break. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g.,
DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] and pressure) for both 3-loop and 4-loop operation continue to be met
with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to 10 seconds. No other accident analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of
the FSAR are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time.


Additionally, evaluations have determined that the proposal does not affect the environmental qualification program
for either the main steam valve building or the containment, does not impact the design basis accident radiological
consequence calculations, does not negatively impact fluid transient evaluations, has a negligible impact on the
long term cooling capacity of the steam generators, and does not change pipe rupture mechanistic effects.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed change does not introduce any new failure modes. It simply modifies an acceptance criterion for a surveillance
requirement. As such, increasing the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds affects only the FSAR analyses for
the feedwater line break and the main stream line break. No other accident analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of the FSAR
are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g., DNBR and
pressure) for both 3-loop and 4-loop operation continue to be met with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to
10 seconds.

Additionally, evaluations have determined that the proposal does not affect the environmental qualification program
for either the main steam valve building or the containment, does not impact the design basis accident radiological
consequence calculations, does not negatively impact fluid transient evaluations, has a negligible impact on the
long term cooling capacity of the steam generators, and does not change pipe rupture mechanistic effects.

Thus, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The increase in the MSIV stroke time from 5 seconds to 10 seconds has no adverse impact on the FSAR analyses for the feedwater
line break and the main steam line break. The applicable acceptance criteria (e.g., DNBR and pressure) for both 3-loop
and 4-loop operation continue to be met with an increase in the MSIV closure time from 5 to 10 seconds. No other accident
analyses discussed in Chapter 15 of the FSAR are affected by the proposed increase in the MSIV closure time. Additionally,
the proposed change does not impact the consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

Based on the above, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By October 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an
appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspects(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later then 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

<DOCTITLE>Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-77 and DPR-79 issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority (the licensee) for operation
of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee.
The proposed amendments, submitted by the licensee's letter dated September 8, 1994, would incorporate a clarification
to separate the portion of the steam generator tubing from the end of the tube up to the start of the tube-to-tubesheet
weld from the remainder of the tube for the purposes of sample selection and repair when defects are found in this section
of a steam generator tube.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
This change will clarify the requirements for indications found in the region of the steam generator (S/G) tube, which
protrudes below the tubesheet. This region of the tube does not affect the structural integrity of the reactor coolant
system (RCS) pressure boundary, since it is not part of the pressure boundary. This revision will exempt this portion
of the tube from being considered under the result and action required sections of Table 4.4-2 in SQN's TS. Therefore,
indications in this region will not require repairs and will not be used for the purpose of expanding the sample of tubes
to be inspected under the requirements of the TS.
The condition described in this evaluation results in tube integrity considerations commensurate with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 criteria both analytically and empirically. If the indications are hypothetically considered as cracks,
the Row 1 tube end indications neither adversely affect S/G tube integrity or any other component, nor does the presence
of the indications alter the function of the S/G or any other component. Continuing the hypothetical scenario, even
if the crack propagated beyond the weld, the only consequence of an accident that could be caused by plant operation
or by the occurrence of a faulted condition event with the tube end indications, would be negligible leakage from the
primary to secondary system. Such leakage is expected to be insignificant at both normal and faulted conditions.
Therefore, plant operation with the tube end indications present in the Row 1 tubes does not increase the probability
of an analyzed accident such as a S/G tube rupture event,

<TEXT>
 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
Any hypothetical accident as a result of plant operation with the Row 1 tube end indications would be bounded by the
consequences of a postulated S/G tube rupture. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The locations of the axial indications observed are below the tube-to-tubesheet weld. Consequently, it is concluded
that the axial indications do not affect the structural and leakage integrity of the primary pressure boundary. Should
the indications be single or multiple axial cracks on the tube ends, the effect of crack propagation was evaluated.
Tube burst is precluded for cracks within the tubesheet by the constraint provided by the tubesheet. Therefore, crack
lengths do not need to be limited by burst considerations and operating leakage limits are not required to detect crack
lengths associated with the tube burst. However, primary to secondary leakage must be shown to remain within acceptable
limits during all plant conditions. Leak-rate testing shows that such leakage would be negligible during all plant
conditions. Since the pressure boundary integrity, acceptable leak rate, and function of the S/G are not affected
by the presence of the tube end indications, the margin of safety is not reduced.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would during the notice
period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the
Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final
determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will
consider all public and State comments required. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By October 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street,
Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding,
a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or
fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the
contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references
to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely
to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine
dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within
the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner
to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least
one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Utilities Electric Company; Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment Nos. 27 and 13 to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-87 and NPF-89 issued to Texas Utilities Electric Company which consisted of changes
to the technical specifications related to the operation of the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and
2, located in Somervell County, Texas. 

The amendments are effective as of the date of issuance.

The amendments revised Technical Specification 5.3.1 to permit the use of fuel with maximum enrichments of 5.0 weight
percent Uranium 235.

The application for the amendments complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as
required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license
amendments.

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was
published in the 

Federal Register

 to August 1, 1994 (59 FR 38991). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.

The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an
environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the
issuance of these amendments will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CSE hereby proposed to amend the membership application fees imposed by the Exchange as follows:






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Purposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange has determined to increase the fees associated with applications for membership to more accurately
reflect the costs associated with the processing of applications and to place them more in line with the fees existing
on other markets. The increases apply to the initial application fee as well as the fee to exercise a Chicago Board Options
Exchange (``CBOE'') membership. The exercise process is part of the agreement for access between the two markets.
 Additionally, intra-firm transfers of individuals assigned to a membership are being raised to reflect the cost
of processing the transfers.





2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers
or dealers, and in general is designed to protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The CSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of CSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CSE-94-08
and should be submitted by October 11, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Amending the Prompt Receipt and Delivery
of Securities Interpretation Relating to Short Sales</DOCTITLE>



September 12, 1994.




On July 28, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The rule change amends the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation (``Interpretation'') issued
by the NASD Board of Governors under Article III, Section 1 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice.











The NASD proposes to amend the Interpretation to require members or persons associated with members, to annotate
the affirmative determination made prior to effecting a short sale. The affirmative determination requirement
already appears in the Interpretation and requires, among other things, that members or associated persons assure
that the securities involved in a sale will be available by settlement date. For long sales, the affirmative determination
is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed. The Interpretation as it currently reads,
however, does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner with respect to short sales.

Under the Interpretation as amended, members or associated persons will be required to annotate, on the trade ticket
or on some other record maintained for that purpose by the member, the following information in order to comply with
the affirmative determination requirement for short sales:

1. Where a customer assures delivery, the member or associated person must annotate that conversation noting the
present location of the securities; whether the securities are in good deliverable form; and whether the securities
will be delivered to the firm within time for settlement; or

2. Where the member or associated person locates the stock, an annotation must be made that identifies not only the
number of shares needed to cover the short sale but also the individual and firm contacted that offered assurance that
the shares would be delivered or were available for borrowing by settlement date.






In its proposed amendment to the Interpretation, the NASD has not specified the manner in which a member or person associated
with a member must annotate compliance with the affirmative determination requirement applicable to short sales.
It is clear, however, that the affirmative determination requirement contained in the amendment to the Interpretation
applies to each and every transaction; a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing
is not acceptable to satisfy the requirement as is evidenced by the duty to annotate.

Notice of the proposed rule change, as amended, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission
release
 and by publication in the 

Federal Register

.
 No comments were received in response to the Notice. This order approves the proposed rule change.







As the NASD indicated in its filing, requiring annotations will enhance member compliance with the affirmative determination
requirement already imposed by the Interpretation and will enable the NASD to examine member compliance with the
rule more effectively. The NASD also noted that the amendment will make clear the NASD's longstanding policy that
firms may not rely on daily facsimile sheets of ``borrowable stocks'' to satisfy their obligations under the Interpretation.
The addition of the annotation requirement will preclude this practice as members or their associated persons will
have to annotate the name of the person contacted, the name of the firm contacted and the number of shares for each short
sale.

The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal will
enable the NASD to more effectively enforce an already existing provision of the Prompt Receipt and Delivery Interpretation
requiring members of their associated persons to affirmatively determine that shares relating to a short sale are
available for delivery to a purchaser.





Requiring annotation of affirmative determinations will also enhance the NASD's ability to examine for member compliance
with various other NASD short sale rules including those found in Article III, Section 21 of the Rules of Fair Practice
(record keeping)
 and in the Uniform Practice Code, Section 71 (mandatory close-outs).
 Further, the annotation requirement will assist the NASD in examining for member compliance with the short sale rule
or ``bid test,'' recently granted temporary 18 month approval by the SEC.









It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR-NASD-94-32
be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Real Estate Investment
Trusts Market Index Target-Term Securities</DOCTITLE>



September 12, 1994.



I. Introduction



On July 15, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities (``REIT Portfolio'') of U.S. real estate investment trusts
(``REITs''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on August 11, 1994.
 The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on August 25, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposal, as amended.









II. Description of the Proposal



Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities
which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants.
 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the REIT Portfolio (``REIT
Portfolio MITTS'').







As with other MITTS products, the REIT Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 703.19
of the Manual, which provides that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million securities;
(2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million; and (5)
otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria.
 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the REIT Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the Exchange's continued
listing criteria.
 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity,
and will bear no periodic payments of interest. At maturity, holders of REIT Portfolio MITTS will be entitled to receive
an amount in cash based upon the ``Total Return Portfolio Value;'' provided, however, that the amount payable at maturity
will not be less than $9 for each $10 principal amount of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The ``Total Return Portfolio Value''
will be an amount based upon the change in the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity,
plus the aggregate dollar amount of dividends paid on the components of the REIT Portfolio during the term of the REIT
Portfolio MITTS. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' will equal $10, 

i.e., 

the value of the REIT Portfolio on the date the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced by the issuer for initial offering to
the public. The value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity will be based on the average of the closing prices of the components
of the REIT Portfolio for a specified number of days immediately prior to the maturity date of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.
 REIT Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security
or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based,
in part, on the aggregate portfolio value of the REIT Portfolio securities.

According to the NYSE, REIT Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal
amount of the MITTS with potential additional payments based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing
20 highly capitalized REITs. In particular, the proposed REIT Portfolio MITTS will provide 90% principal protection
of the original issue price at maturity with the opportunity to participate in the dividend stream related to the REIT
Portfolio components plus any upside appreciation of the underlying REIT Portfolio. REIT Portfolio MITTS will mature
in August 2000.

As of June 6, 1994, the REIT Portfolio consisted of the common stock of 20 REITs that have significantly different levels
of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $2.3 billion (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low
of approximately $216 million (Excel Realty Trust, Inc.). Also as of June 6, 1994, the exchange market prices of the
components of the REIT Portfolio ranged from a high of $40.25 to a low of $11.25. The average daily trading volume for
the components of the REIT Portfolio for the period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, ranged from a high
of approximately 145,318 shares to a low of approximately 22,030 shares.

The common stocks of 19 of the 20 component REITs are listed on the Exchange and the common stock of the other component
REIT is traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''). The initial weightings of the components of the REIT Portfolio
will be based upon each stock's relative liquidity (

i.e.

, relative trading volume in dollars) in the Untied States; provided, however, that no component may represent more
than 10% of the Original Portfolio Value.






To determine relative liquidity, Merrill Lynch will compare the average daily consolidated dollar volume of a stock
over the 90-day period immediately preceding the date on which the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced for issuance to
the average daily consolidated dollar volume for all of the stocks in the REIT Portfolio for that 90-day period. As
of June 6, 1994, the highest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 10.00%
 and the weighting for the five components with the highest relative liquidity was 42.50%. Also as of that date, the
lowest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 1.58% and the weighting for the five components with the lowest
relative liquidity was 10.24%. For the six-month period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, the average
dollar daily trading volume of the components ranged from a high of $2,468,375 (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low
of $345,618 (Western Investment Real Estate Trust).





Except for certain multiplier adjustments discussed below, once the initial weightings have been determined, the
multipliers will remain constant throughout the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The value of the REIT Portfolio
MITTS at any point in time will equal the aggregate for the components of the price of each component times the multiplier
for that component plus the cumulative dividends paid on each component since the issue date for the REIT Portfolio
MITTS. The multipliers assigned to the component REITs will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse
stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the common stock of the component REITs will also be adjusted for
certain events including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer
of the underlying shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component REIT has been subject to a
merger or a consolidation and is not the surviving entity, then the value for such common stock will be determined at
the time such issuer is merged or consolidated and will equal the last available exchange market price for such common
stock plus the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS through
that date.
 That value will then be constant for the remaining term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. In addition, no adjustments of
any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the
multiplier then in effect.





If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency,
or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the REIT Portfolio so long as an exchange
market price for such security is available. If an exchange market price is no longer available for a portfolio security,
including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding, then the value
of that portfolio security used in calculating both the daily value of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio
Value, will be equal to the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS
through that date.
 This value will be used as long as no exchange market price exists for that security.







Based upon the exchange reported prices of the common stock of the component REITs, an independent third party will
calculate and disseminate the value of the REIT Portfolio no less frequently than once every minute during the trading
day.

<TEXT>
 

Like the other MITTS products that are listed on the NYSE, REIT Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity
and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of REIT Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out of their investment by selling
the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary trading
market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the REIT Portfolio and also on such other
factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the REIT Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity,
dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch.






Because REIT Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE's existing equity floor trading
rules will apply to the trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will impose
a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior
to trading REIT Portfolio MITTS.
 Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading REIT Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction.
Third, REIT Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange. Fourth, in accordance with
the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading REIT Portfolio MITTS, distribute a circular
to the membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability
recommendations) when handling transactions in REIT Portfolio MITTS and highlighting the special risks and characteristics
of the REIT Portfolio MITTS.







III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS will
offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for REITs. In particular, the Commission believes
that REIT Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure to REITs, while at the same time, limiting
the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
finds that the listing and trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS is in the public interest.






As with the other MITTS products approved by the Commission, REIT Portfolio MITTS are not leveraged instruments;
however, their price will still be derived and based upon the underlying linked securities. Accordingly, the level
of risk involved in the purchase or sale of REIT Portfolio MITTS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale
of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, as with the other MITTS products, the Commission has several specific
concerns regarding the trading of this type of product.

The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to REIT Portfolio MITTS. In particular, by imposing the hybrid listing
standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes the Exchange
has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of REIT Portfolio MITTS.
Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific risks associated
with REIT Portfolio MITTS.

The Commission realized that REIT Portfolio MITTS are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer, Merrill
Lynch. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which require issuers
to maintain an aggregate market value of $5 million for its publicly-held shares.
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that REIT Portfolio MITTS have at least $4 million
in market value. In any event, financial information regarding Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information regarding
Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the REIT Portfolio,
will be publicly available.







The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Merrill Lynch, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of REIT Portfolio MITTS issuance in relation to the net worth of Merrill
Lynch.

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS should not unduly impact the market for
the individual securities contained in the REIT Portfolio. First, as discussed above, the components of the REIT
Portfolio are highly capitalized, liquid stocks. Second, as discussed above, because of the restriction that no
component may account for more than 10% of the initial weight of the REIT Portfolio, no single component or group of
components dominates the REIT Portfolio. Third, the issuers of the securities contained in the REIT Portfolio are
subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and all of the portfolio securities are listed and traded on U.S.
securities exchanges. Finally, the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended on
January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of REIT Portfolio MITTS and of the underlying component securities.
 This, in addition to the NYSE's surveillance procedures, will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.






The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to list without delay REIT Portfolio MITTS as described herein. Specifically, in Amendment
No. 1 to the proposal, the Exchange proposes to provide that all dividends paid on any component REIT after the date
of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS and prior to a corporate event which would effect the value of that component
security shall be used in calculating both the daily values of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio Value.
The Commission believes this is appropriate because it is consistent with the risks involved in the direct ownership
of the individual component securities, 

i.e., 

the owner of a security generally will not be required to return dividends paid by the issuer prior to the insolvency
of the issuer. 

The Exchange also proposes a modified weighting system in Amendment No. 1 whereby no component of the REIT Portfolio
may account for more than 10% of the Original Portfolio Value. The effect of the weighting method in this case is merely
to reduce the weight of one component from 10.22% to 10.00% and to raise the initial weights of the remaining components
only marginally.
 Additionally, for the full six-year term of the MITTS, the weights of the component REITS may move freely above the
10% level based on subsequent price changes among the components. As a result, the Commission believes that this weighting
method has an immaterial effect on the valuation of the REIT Portfolio during the term of the MITTS and on the amount
that holders of the REIT Portfolio MITTS will ultimately receive upon maturity of the MITTS. 





For the reasons stated above, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change on an accelerated basis. 

It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-94-28), as amended, is approved. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

1. The Company was a savings and loan holding company whose primary asset and source of income was the United Savings
Association of Texas (``USAT''). As a result of the recession in Texas beginning in 1986, USAT's financial condition
deteriorated, and on December 30, 1988 it was placed into receivership. The assets of USAT were sold to an unaffiliated
third party and the Company received no consideration for the loss of its primary subsidiary, thereby generating
a substantial tax loss. In light of this tax loss, the Company determined not to liquidate, but instead to acquire an
operating business.
2. The Company's efforts to acquire an operating business have been substantially hindered due to claims asserted
against it by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (the ``FSLIC'') and its successor, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the ``FDIC''), which term as used herein includes the FSLIC. The FDIC asserted an approximately
$534 million claim against the Company in January 1989 for failure to maintain the net worth of USAT (the ``Net Worth
Claim'') and an approximately $14 million claim concerning certain tax refunds alleged to have been received by the
Company (together with the Net Worth Claim, the ``FDIC Claims''). In addition, the FDIC has asserted the existence
of possible other claims (the ``Indemnified Claims'') against the Company and certain former officers and directors
of the Company and USAT. The Company may have indemnification obligations to these former officers and directors.
The FDIC has not alleged a dollar amount for any Indemnified Claims. Although the Company disputes the FDIC Claims
and the Indemnified Claims, their existence constitutes a large contingent liability against the Company's assets,
thus making it difficult for the Company to acquire an operating business.
3. During 1989 and 1990, the Company was in continuous negotiations with the FDIC in an attempt to reach a resolution
of the FDIC Claims and in early 1990 the Company reached a tentative agreement. However, in December 1990 the FDIC rejected
the Company's settlement offer and informed the Company that no counter proposal would be offered. In mid-1991, the
Company again contacted the FDIC to determine whether a settlement could be reached on the FDIC Claims. Beginning
in July 1991, the Company and the FDIC's representatives again began negotiations and in August 1991, the Company
offered a proposed settlement. Although the FDIC has not responded to the Company's settlement proposal, in December
1991 the FDIC requested, and the Company provided, an agreement to toll the statute of limitations for the period expiring
July 31, 1992. This would give the FDIC adequate time to review any possible claims against the Company that might reflect
on a global settlement. This tolling agreement was subsequently extended eleven times, initially through September
30, 1992, then eventually through December 30, 1994. During this tolling period, the Company has engaged in continuous
discussions with the FDIC staff and as part of that process has furnished the FDIC with documents and financial records
for their review.

4. On June 30, 1994, the Company held assets of approximately $11.94 million, comprised of approximately $.27 million
in cash and cash equivalents, $9.92 million in short-term investments, $1.23 million in loans and notes receivable,
and $.52 million in other assets. The Company's common stock currently is traded sporadically in the over-the-counter
market. The Company does not employ any full-time employees. The Company's administrative operations are handled
by contract bookkeepers, accountants, and attorneys.

5. Rule 3a-2 under the Act provides a one-year safe harbor to issuers that meet the definition of an investment
company but intend to maintain that status only transiently. The Company relied on the safe harbor provided by this
rule from December 30, 1988 until December 30, 1989. The expiration of the safe harbor period necessitated the filing
of an application for exemption. In 1990, the Company was granted conditional relief from all provisions of the Act
until December 30, 1990 (the ``1990 Order''). The SEC extended this exemptive relief by four subsequent orders, most
recently until December 30, 1994.






6. As described in detail in the applications for the Prior Orders, during a portion of the period in which the requested
exemption will be effective, it is possible that the Company will be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy
courts. In this regard, the Company has formulated a plan of reorganization (the ``Reorganization Plan'') to be implemented
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code once the FDIC approves a settlement of the FDIC Claims. The Reorganization
Plan would settle the outstanding claims against the Company and provide a structure for the possible acquisition
of a new operating business or businesses. Because the bankruptcy court is charged with protecting the interests
of the Company's creditors and equity interest holders, the Company believes that it is not necessary for it to comply
with section 17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to transactions approved by the bankruptcy court. 




Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value
of such issuers' total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items). The Company acknowledges that,
based on its current mix of assets, it may be deemed to be an investment company under section 3(a)(3).

2. The Company requests, pursuant to sections 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act, that the SEC issue an order exempting the Company
from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, until December 30, 1995. The requested order would
extend the exemption granted by the Prior Orders.

3. In determining whether to grant exemptive relief for a transient investment company, the SEC considers such factors
as: (a) Whether the failure of the company to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business or excepted business
or liquidate within one year was due to factors beyond its control; (b) whether the company's officers and employees
during that period tried, in good faith, to effect the company's investment of its assets in a non-investment business
or excepted business or to cause the liquidation of the company; and (c) whether the company invested in securities
solely to preserve the value of its assets. The Company asserts that it meets these criteria.

4. The Company asserts that its failure to become primarily engaged in a non-investment business by December 30, 1994
is a result of factors beyond its control. The existence of the FDIC Claims has precluded the Company from investing
its assets in a non-investment company business. Although the Company's executive officers reviewed numerous possible
asset or business acquisitions, the magnitude of the FDIC Claims and the potential threat that the FDIC would seek
to enjoin any utilization of the Company's assets has prevented the Company from investing its assets in a non-investment
company business.
5. Pending the settlement of the FDIC Claims, the Company has limited its investments to high quality marketable securities,
cash or cash equivalents. Thus, the Company asserts that it primarily invests in securities solely to preserve the
value of its assets.
6. Although the Company has made substantial efforts to formulate alternative methods by which it can acquire an operating
business and utilize its tax loss, the pending settlement negotiations of the FDIC Claims make it necessary for the
Company to seek relief extending the relief granted by the Prior Orders. This would allow the Company to seek an FDIC
settlement and, if successful, to formulate and implement new plans for becoming an operating business and utilizing
the Tax Loss.

7. The Company believes that the issuance of an order exempting it from all provisions of the Act, subject to certain
exceptions, until December 30, 1995 would be in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes of the Act.



Applicant's Conditions



The Company agrees that the requested exemption will be subject to the following conditions, each of which will apply
to the Company until it acquires an operating business or otherwise falls outside the definition of an investment
company:

1. During the period of time the Company is exempted from registration under the Act, it will not purchase or otherwise
acquire any securities other than securities with a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and that are rated in one
of the two highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as that term is
defined in rule 2a-7(a)(10) under the Act.

2. The Company will continue to comply with section 9, 17(e) and 36 of the Act.

3. The Company will continue to comply with sections 17(a) and17(d), subject to the following exceptions:

(a) if the Company becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, the Company need not comply with section
17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to any transaction, including without limitation the Reorganization Plan, that
is approved by the bankruptcy court; and 
(b) the Company would not be required to comply with section 17(a) or section 17(d) with respect to any transaction
or series of transactions that result in its ceasing to fall within the definition of an ``investment company'' provided
that (i) no cash payments are made to an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act) of the Company as part of such transaction
or series of transactions, and (ii) no debt securities are issued to an affiliated person of the Company as part of such
transaction or series of transactions unless such debt securities are expressly subordinated upon liquidation
to claim of the holders of the Company's 9% Debentures.
4. The Company will continue to comply with section 17(f) of the Act as provided in rule 17f-2.

Defense Trade Advisory Group Partially Closed Meeting



The Defense Trade Advisory Group (DTAG) will meet from 10:00-4:45 P.M. on Thursday, October 6, 1994 in the Loy
Henderson Conference Room, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20520. This advisory
committee consists of private sector defense trade specialists who advise the Department on policies, regulations,
and technical issues affecting defense trade.

The 

Federal Register

 notice of June 30, 1994 announced that the October 6 DTAG meeting would be an open meeting. After setting the agenda,
State Department officials and the DTAG officers found it necessary to close the afternoon portions of the meeting.

The open session, which will be made up of all sessions preceding the lunch break, will include speakers from the Bureau
of Political-Military Affairs and reports on DTAG Working Group progress, accomplishments, and future projects.
Members of the public may attend the open session as seating capacity allows, and will be permitted to participate
in the discussion in accordance with the Chairman's instructions.

As access to the Department of State is controlled, persons wishing to attend the meeting must notify the DTAG Executive
Secretariat by Friday, September 30, 1994. Each person should provide his or her name, company or organizational
affiliation, date of birth, and social security number to the DTAG Secretariat at telephone number (202) 647-4231
of fax number (202) 647-4232 (Attention: Eva Chesteen). Attendees must carry a valid photo ID with them. They
should enter the building through the C-Street diplomatic entrance (21st and C Streets, NW.), where Department personnel
will direct them to the Loy Henderson auditorium.

Following the open portion of the meeting, briefings which the Department of State will arrange for DTAG members will
involve discussions of classified information pursuant to Executive Order 12356. The disclosure of classified
and/or proprietary information essential to formulating U.S. defense trade policies would substantially undermine
U.S. defense trade relations with foreign competitors. Therefore, these segments of the meeting will be closed to
the public, pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1) and 5 U.S.C.
552b(c)(9)(B).

For further information, contact Linda Lum of the DTAG Secretariat, U.S. Department of State, Office of Export Control
Policy (PM/EXP), Room 2422 Main State, Washington, DC 20520-2422. She may be reached at telephone number (202)

<DOCTITLE>Shipping Coordinating Committee Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment and Associated Bodies; Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The Shipping Coordinating Committee (SHC) will conduct an open meeting at 9:30 am on Friday, October 7, 1994, in Room
2415, at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001. The purpose of
the meeting is to finalize preparations for the Thirty-eighth session of the Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment
(DE 38) and associated bodies of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is scheduled for January 23-27,
1995, at the IMO Headquarters in London. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the papers received and the draft U.S.
positions for DE 38.
Among other things, the items of particular interest are:




a. Safety of passenger submersible craft;
b. Development of safety standards for combined pusher tug-barges;
c. Guidelines for safe ocean towing;
d. Guidelines for the design and operation of passenger ships to the needs of elderly and disabled persons;
e. Use of compressed air systems for buoyancy;
f. Ventilation of vehicle decks during loading and unloading;
g. matters related to the prevention of oil pollution;
h. And matters relating to ship structures, including hull stress monitoring devices, corrosion protection for
ballast tanks, and access to tank and ballast space structures;
i. Structural aspects of the on-board use of composite materials;
j. Requirements for ships intended for polar waters;
k. Revision of the Code of safety for diving systems;
l. Review of existing ships' safety standards; and
m. Guidelines on standard calculation methods for anchor positioning systems for MODUs.




The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry.
In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations
and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the
IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because
of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations,
the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All
shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged
to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime
industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO.
Members of the public may attend this meeting up to the seating capacity of the room. Interested persons may seek information
by writing: CDR Jim Stamm, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Commandant (G-MTH), Room 1218, 2100 Second Street,
SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001 or by calling: (202) 267-2206.

<USBUREAU>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Modification of a Previously Approved Antitheft Device; BMW</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of petition for modification of a previously approved antitheft device.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1986, this agency granted BMW of North America, Inc.'s (BMW) petition for exemption from the parts marking requirements
of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the BMW 7 Car line. This notice grants BMW's petition for a modification
of the previously approved antitheft device. The agency grants this petition because it has determined, based on
substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in BMW's petition to be placed on the car line
as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with
parts marking requirements.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In October 1986, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice granting the petition from BMW of North America, Inc. (BMW) for an exemption from the parts marking requirements
of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the model year (MY) 1988 BMW 7 Car line. (See 51 FR 36333, October 9, 1986).
The agency determined that the antitheft device which BMW intended to install on the 7 Car line as standard equipment
is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking
requirements of the theft prevention standard.



On February 17, 1994, BMW submitted a letter to the agency stating that the MY 1995 7 Car line would include modifications
to the antitheft system that is installed as standard equipment. In a letter dated August 12, 1994, the agency informed
BMW that the modification to the antitheft system on the 7 Car line appeared to be subject to NHTSA approval pursuant
to 49 CFR section 543.9, 

Terminating or modifying an exemption. 

The agency had determined that the changes to the previously approved antitheft system were not 

de minimis, 

based on BMW's discussions of proposed changes to radio and glove box monitoring, and the addition of a glass breakage
sensor.

On August 26, 1994, BMW submitted its petition for modification. The petition incorporated by reference certain
information, dated May 29, 1986, that BMW already provided to NHTSA in its petition for exemption for the MY 1988 7 Car
line. Together, the above information submitted by BMW constitutes a complete petition, as required by 49 CFR section
543.9(d), in that it meets the general requirements contained in section 543.5 and the specific content requirements
of section 543.6.

In its petition for MY 1988, BMW included a detailed description of the identity, design and location of the components
of the antitheft device, including diagrams of components and their location in the vehicle. BMW stated that the system
consists of three lines of defense designed to prevent entry, disable the car, and scare away potential thieves. BMW
described the antitheft device that was installed as standard equipment as passively activated.

BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft system will be modified in three ways:

(1) A remote control device will be added. BMW describes the remote control device as ``an integral component within
the vehicle key,'' used to lock/unlock the door(s) and actuate the alarm system. BMW stated that the remote control
device is identical to that provided for the antitheft device on the BMW 8 Car line. In a letter to BMW dated October 4,
1993, NHTSA determined that the addition of the remote on the 8 Car line is a 

de minimis 

change to the antitheft device.

(2) Monitoring circuits for the radio and glove box are removed. In their place, the antitheft device will monitor
glass breakage. As under the original exemption, the antitheft device monitors door opening. BMW asserts that the
combination of the door and glass monitoring make the occupant compartment impenetrable. If the glass is broken in
order to unlock and open a door, the device sounds. Likewise, if a door is opened by a means other than breaking the glass,
e.g., through the use of a slim jim, the device sounds when a door is opened.

(3) The alarm siren's decibel level is raised from 104 decibels to 112 decibels.

BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft device features a comprehensive security alarm system and an ignition/fuel
system disabling device that is activated by locking the door (either driver or passenger) with the metal key. The
key can be turned in the front door locks in three positions: off; 45 degrees; and 90 degrees. If the driver holds the
key a little past the 90 degree position, any open windows and the sunroof close. When the key is turned 45 degrees and
removed, the doors, trunk, and fuel filler door are locked and the alarm system is armed. Additionally, when the key
is removed from the driver's or passenger's door lock after having been turned 45 degrees, the ignition and fuel injection
systems are deactivated, immobilizing the car.

When the key is turned 90 degrees and removed, the car's alarm is armed and the doors are ``double locked.'' The alarm
monitors the doors, hood, trunk, side window glazing and ignition switch. If the key is not first turned in the driver's
or passenger's door lock, the alarm will sound if someone tampers with the doors, hood, or trunk, or turns the ignition
switch. When this happens, the horn will sound, and the hazard warning lamps and high beam headlights will flash.

After 30 seconds, the alarm will automatically shut off and then rearm itself within 5 seconds. The alarm system has
its own separate fuse, so removal of any of the fuses in the fuse box of the engine compartment will not disarm the system.
The hood has an inside lock release located underneath the dashboard, and is also tied into the alarm system. BMW stated
that the electronic control unit for the system is hidden within the vehicle. Cutting, disconnecting, or manipulating
system wiring will trigger the alarm. Therefore, if a thief did manage to penetrate to the battery circuit and interrupt
it, the alarm systems' memory will trigger the alarm when the circuit is again completed.

The steering/ignition lock is hardened against the grip of a screw, and the housing is reinforced to prevent removal
of the lock. When the key is removed, the steering lock has a mechanism that causes the lock to instantly engage, preventing
steering wheel movement without any additional action. BMW states that the steering lock cannot be broken by forcing
the steering wheel because a clutch in the steering drive is designed to slip long before torque sufficient to break
the lock can be administered.

BMW states that the inside locking mechanism operates by means of a vertical plunger on each door, and that the plunger
on the driver's door overrides the other plunger. In the event of an accident, an inertia switch will unlock all doors.
The same key operates door locks and the ignition/steering lock, and can be inserted in a keyhole in either direction.
To prevent locking the keys in the car upon exiting, the driver's door can only be locked with a key after it is closed.

BMW describes the key for the 7 Car line as being unique in that it has the equivalent of four rows of teeth. BMW asserts
that the unique design makes the locks almost impossible to pick and the keys impossible to duplicate on the open market.
Special key blanks, key cutting machines, and codes will be closely controlled and new keys will only be issued to authorized
persons. Additionally, the first gate in the door lock keyway is hardened to resist the grip of a screw to prevent use
of a slampuller.

BMW states that an LED warning lamp on the center console which is visible from outside of the vehicle informs the driver
of the arming status of the alarm/no-start systems. Upon return to the operator's vehicle, the warning lamp informs
the operator if a theft attempt has been made, or if a door, hood or trunk is not completely closed. It also indicates
if there are any problems with the system. Additionally, BMW states that the vehicle's diagnostic umbilical contains
extra circuits which, when plugged into the vehicle diagnostic machine at the dealership, identifies problems with
the antitheft system.

As a complementary feature to the passive system, the operator may manually arm another alarm system and deactivate
the vehicle's ignition/fuel systems so that a thief would not be able to start the engine and steal the vehicle. This
active system is armed by the driver keying in a 4-digit code into the computer built into the dashboard.

BMW addressed the reliability and durability of its antitheft device by providing a list of American and international
standards for which the antitheft system has been tested and found in compliance. This list includes various environmental
tests and a Swedish regulation that requires door and ignition locks to be able to resist commonly available tools
for a minimum period of 5 minutes in attempted forced entries. BMW uses the proposed system's conformance to these
standards as support for the likely effectiveness of the system in reducing and deterring theft.

BMW noted that NHTSA's February 1986 Report to Congress indicates that the first year's theft rate for new introductions
are generally lower because the demand for replacement parts is relatively small. BMW believes that this finding
applies to its 7 Car line and that theft rates will generally be lower because of the limited total sales of these vehicles.
Additionally, BMW believes that most of this car line will be stolen for the value of the whole car, not its parts. BMW
stated that since parts marking seeks to deter thefts of automobiles for their parts, while antitheft devices deter
all thefts, BMW believes that its antitheft system ``should be considerably more effective'' in reducing and deterring
theft than parts marking.

BMW compares its MY 1995 antitheft system to similar systems which have previously been granted exemptions by the
agency. It compared its proposed system to systems installed in the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS.
BMW believes that its analysis reveals that its system is equivalent to, or has more extensive features than, all of
the compared systems previously granted an exemption by the agency. The agency believes that the BMW antitheft device
is comparable to the systems on the cited car lines.

The 1983/84 median theft rate was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985).
Based on data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, NHTSA's official source of theft data, BMW showed
that for MYs 1989 through 1992, the theft rates of the Saab 9000, Mazda 929, Infiniti M30, and Lexus LS fell mostly below
3.2712. For 1989, the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 2.3691 (per thousand vehicles manufactured), and the Mazda 929 had
a theft rate of 3.3610. No theft data were available for the Infiniti M30 or Lexus LS for 1989. For 1990/91, the Saab 9000
had a theft rate of 0.5125, the Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.7178, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7496, and the
Lexus LS had a theft rate of 1.8977. For 1992, preliminary data show that the Saab 9000 had a theft rate of 0.4695, the
Mazda 929 had a theft rate of 2.6477, the Infiniti M30 had a theft rate of 2.7117, and the Lexus LS had a theft rate of 2.4390.

For these reasons, BMW believes that the antitheft system proposed for installation on its 7 Car line is likely to be
as effective in reducing thefts as compliance with the parts marking requirements of part 541.

NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the modified antitheft system installed as standard
equipment on the MY 1995 BMW 7 Car line will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance
with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). This determination is based on the information
that BMW submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency believes that the modified device
will continue to provide the types of performance listed in section 543.6(a)(3): promoting activation; attracting
attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorized persons; preventing
operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device.

<TEXT>
 

As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that BMW has provided adequate reasons for its belief
that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information BMW provided
on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by BMW for the
antitheft device and its components. 

49 CFR section 543.9(h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the antitheft
device earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision'' upon
a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent
with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, BMW stated that making the modification
of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit expeditious
manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. BMW stated the 1989 theft
data published by NHTSA in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 7444, February 22, 1991) show that the BMW 7 Car line had a theft rate of 3.9505 per thousand vehicles stolen, somewhat
above the 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712. BMW stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed for the MY 1995
7 Car line, with improvements that enhance the effectiveness of the antitheft system, will lower the 7 Car line's theft
rate. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of BMW's petition effective
beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section 33106. 

For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the BMW 7 Car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole,
from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. 

If, in the future, BMW decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally
notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under
49 CFR section 541.5 and section 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). 

The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts
marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness
of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency
has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft
Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. 

NHTSA notes that if BMW wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have
to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles
that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' 

The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle
manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 

de minimis. 

Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 

de minimis,

 it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.

National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
Organization Act of 1992, Public Law 102-538, 106 Stat. 3533 (1992) (codified 
at 47 U.S.C. 901 

et seq.

) 



I. Introduction1






1. The United States has a long-standing commitment to the achievement of ``universal service''_widespread availability
of ``basic'' telephone service at affordable rates. First articulated in the early twentieth century,2 universal
service has since been adopted by Federal and State regulators as one of the core objectives of U.S. telecommunications
policy. For example, it was incorporated in general terms in Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934.3 More importantly,
many of the major regulatory reforms that have been considered over the past several decades_most notably decisions
concerning whether and under what conditions to allow competition in telecommunications service and equipment
markets_have been evaluated, at least in part, in terms of their possible impact on universal service. 






2. Historically, universal service has meant widespread access to voice-grade 
telephone service, commonly referred to as ``plain old telephone service'' (POTS). 
The fundamental objective has been to give all Americans an opportunity to pick 
up the telephone and, at a reasonable cost, have a voice conversation with anyone 
else in the country or, increasingly, the world. In recent years, however, many 
have questioned whether traditional notions of universal service are adequate to 
meet the needs of the American people, now and in the 21st century.

3. This reassessment is prompted by two principal developments. First is the 
emergence of information as a vital economic resource and source of individual 
empowerment. In 1991, U.S. companies for the first time spent more money on 
computer and communications equipment than on industrial, mining, farm and 
manufacturing machinery_dramatic evidence of the nation's transition from the 
Industrial Age to the Information Age.
 Increasingly, the ability of U.S. 
businesses to remain competitive in a global marketplace and to create challenging, 
high-paying jobs hinges on their proficiency in creating, manipulating, managing, 
and using information. Similarly, an individual's ability to acquire, develop, and 
sustain marketable job skills_and, indeed, to be an informed, productive 
participant in American society_will depend on how well he or she can access, 
analyze, and assimilate information. 







4. Second, technological changes_particularly the convergence of computers 
and communications and the deployment of high capacity, digital transmission 
facilities_promise to make telecommunications networks the highways of the 
Information Age, the principal means by which individuals and businesses access 
and distribute essential information resources. In this environment, it may be 
anachronistic to continue speaking of universal service in terms of voice telephone 
service. Accordingly, consensus is growing that there is a need to redefine that 
concept to meet the demands of a new age. 



5. Reform of universal service policies would be necessary even if there were 
no redefinition issue. As described more fully below, many experts agree that 
current pricing policies for voice telephone service are characterized by extensive 
subsidies between and among services, although the extent of those subsidies 
remains a matter of considerable dispute.
 In other words, certain services (

e.g.,

 long distance, business service) have been overpriced to maintain low cost 
residential voice service. Whether or not that pricing structure was ever desirable 
as a matter of policy,
 it could be sustained only in a market environment 
characterized by monopoly provision of telephone service. 








6. That environment is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Competition is the 
norm in many telecommunications services and equipment markets; it is growing 
rapidly in the rest. Competition drives prices toward the costs of providing those 
services and, in so doing, undermines traditional pricing structures that incorporate 
inter-service subsidies. As a result, even though competition is not inimical to 
universal service goals,
 its emergence and expansion is forcing a re-examination 
of traditional universal service funding policies as surely as technological change 
and the emergence of the Information Age are prompting changes in the way 
universal service is defined. The challenge for government and service providers 
alike is to find a new funding scheme that is compatible with and sustainable in a 
competitive market environment. 






7. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is 
issuing this Notice to gather public comment on these important issues. The 
Clinton Administration (the Administration) has stated a commitment to extending 
the concept of universal service to ensure that information resources are available 
to all at affordable rates.
 This policy is a matter of fundamental fairness; if 
information means empowerment, the United States ``cannot accept a division of 
our people among telecommunications `haves' and `have-nots.'''
 








8. This Notice represents another stage in NTIA's continuing investigation of 
universal service issues.
 Since December 1993, NTIA has conducted field 
hearings in five locations across the country to gather information on those 
issues.
 This Notice has been shaped by what the agency has learned over the 
course of those hearings. The Notice also seeks to supplement the record 
developed at those hearings on the many questions subsumed within the concept 
of universal service. At the end of this process, NTIA will work to develop a 
concept of universal service that fits the challenges and opportunities of the 
Information Age. As importantly, NTIA intends to identify mechanisms that can 
fund an expanded version of universal service in a competitive market 
environment. 








9. Finally, we also seek comment on another issue related to the policies 
underlying universal service_``open access.'' If, as noted above, information is of 
increasing importance to businesses and individuals alike, and if competition among 
service providers is likely to be the norm in the future, ensuring universal service 
for consumers is only part of the equation. Steps must also be taken to afford 
information providers access to consumers and vice versa. Accordingly, the 
Administration is also committed to ensuring that telecommunications facilities and 
networks are sufficiently ``open'' so that all information providers can transmit their 
wares to consumers across those facilities reliably, efficiently, and seamlessly, 
without compromising the integrity or security of the information delivered.
 
NTIA therefore requests comment on a variety of questions relating to the meaning 
and implementation of open access. 







10. Section II of the Notice considers the impact of competition on universal 
service goals. Section III.A of the Notice addresses current universal service 
policies and solicits comment on the degree to which the nation has achieved the 
goal of providing basic voice telephone service to all Americans. Section III.B 
considers the issue of redefining the traditional concept of universal service and 
determining what services or functions should be included in an expanded 
definition of universal service. Section IV focuses on mechanisms for funding 
universal service in an increasingly competitive market environment. Section V 
focuses on the role of the Federal and State governments in determining universal 
service policies. Finally, Section VI requests comment on the definition and 
implementation of open access.

II. Competition and Universal Service 


11. The Federal government and many States have made a fundamental 
commitment to introducing and expanding competition in telecommunications 
markets. The benefits of that commitment are increasingly apparent and show no 
signs of diminishing. There is also some concern, however, about the effects of competition on universal service.
While those concerns merit attention, there is much evidence to suggest that competition and universal service are
not incompatible goals. Market rivalry both drives prices towards underlying costs and reduces underlying costs
by forcing competing firms to operate more efficiently. Competition thus tends to reduce prices for goods and services,
making them more affordable for more consumers and ultimately reducing the need for subsidies. At the same time, competition
also increases the range of services and products available to consumers and, potentially, their geographic reach
as well, further promoting universal service goals. 

12. The potential effects of competition on rates and consumer choice can be gleaned from the recent history of the
long distance and CPE markets in the United States. Prior to the break-up of the Bell System in 1984, most of the United
States was served by a single long distance network operated by AT&T. Today, after a decade of government efforts
to facilitate entry in the long distance market, there are more than 500 long distance carriers in the United States,
offering a wide, ever-changing array of services and pricing options.
 Due in part to this active rivalry among firms, long distance rates have declined more than sixty percent since 1984
by some estimations, making long distance calling more affordable for more Americans.







13. Similarly, when the Bell System controlled the CPE market, customers could lease (but not buy) any telephone they
wanted, so long as it was a black 
instrument that delivered unadorned voice service. Today, customers can choose 
their phones from a wide variety of colors, sizes, shapes, and designs. Modern 
telephones also include a variety of features (e.g., speed dialing, re-dial, memory programming) that greatly increase
usefulness of that equipment for many customers. In addition, its cost has declined considerably in the last decade
(as much as 50 percent in ``real'' terms).






14. The impact of competition on universal service can be examined more 
directly by reviewing the development of local telephone service after expiration of the original Bell telephone
patents in 1893/94 unleashed a twenty-five year period of competition in the provision of local telephone service.
 In 1895, after nineteen years of the Bell System patent monopoly, there were only 251,994 telephones in the United
States, or one telephone for every 276 of the nation's 69.5 million people. By 1920, at the close of the competitive
era, there were some 13.4 million telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every eight of the nation's
105.7 million people.
 Moreover, fifty-five percent of all telephone subscribers were residential customers, as compared to only ten percent
in 1895.

15. We seek comment on the relationship between competition and universal 
service. Will competition help make new advanced telecommunications services 
more readily available across the nation and thereby reduce the need for universal service regulation? Some argue
that the universal service rationale is based on the premise that the market alone cannot uniformly guarantee provision
of telecommunications and services. They believe that depending on the market to provide advanced services may seriously
impede access by important segments of society to those services, particularly if the offerings are not commercially
viable in certain areas.
 Consumer and civil rights groups, in particular, raise the specter of ``electronic redlining,'' in which low income
and minority neighborhoods are ``systematically underrepresented'' in the deployment of advanced services, as
has been alleged with respect to various local telephone companies' video dialtone networks.








16. To what extent is ``electronic redlining'' occurring or likely to occur, 

i.e.

, the calculated exclusion of a geographic area from deployment of advanced telecommunications capabilities or
services on the basis of income, ethnicity, race, or disability? What weight should be assigned to those arguments
that identify economic reasons for serving certain areas on a less timely basis than others? 


17. Various proposals address the concern that a marketplace-driven definition of universal service may not bring
comparable services to all segments of the population or to all areas of the country at the same rate. One proposal,
for example, is for government to require firms to provide services to community centers, such as schools and libraries,
at the same time that such services are first provided to businesses and residences. The proponents of this approach
claim that focusing on providing service to such centralized points within a community, as a transitional mechanism,
could make desirable services more widely available without incurring the risks and costs of mandating universal
provision of uneconomical or unwanted services.
 We request comment on this approach. In particular, do such public institutions have the facilities, funds, and hours
of operation to afford individuals, especially the young, a full and fair opportunity to explore the highways of the
Information Age? If not, what mechanisms could be explored for providing such resources?

18. We also seek comment on the possible effects of competition on the 
achievement of universal service goals in rural areas. Some argue that competition 
in such areas is not only unsustainable, but potentially destructive to universal 
service goals.
 On the other hand, competition may spur the introduction or 
expansion of service in rural areas, as suggested by the forty-fold increase in 
telephone penetration that occurred in rural areas during the competitive period 
between 1895 and 1920.
 We also solicit comment as to whether the ``rural 
subscriber may be just as willing to ride the information highway as his urban 
counterpart,'' thereby creating a market setting that could sustain competition.
 

 





III. Universal Service Today and in the Future 
 

 

19. The record developed over the course of NTIA's five universal service field 
hearings demonstrates considerable public support for expanding the current 
definition of universal service beyond ``plain old telephone service''_POTS.
 
Accordingly, this section of the Notice addresses the myriad issues raised by such 
a redefinition.
 Because any new concept of universal service will build on the 
existing definition, it is appropriate, however, first to consider the extent to which 
the nation has achieved its goal of universal POTS before turning our attention to a 
new definition of universal service. 

 




A. Achievement of Universal POTS 
 

 

19a. In many respects, U.S. universal service policies have been a major success. 
As of March, 1994, 93.9% of all American households had telephone service, 
compared to 91.4% a decade earlier, and fewer than fifty percent at the end of 
World War II.
 Moreover, telephone subscribership in the United States 
exceeds that in most other nations, often by a substantial margin.
 

 




20. On the other hand, although the vast majority of American homes have at 
least one telephone, approximately six million households have none.

<TEXT>
 

Household penetration rates (

i.e., 

the percentage of households with a telephone) 
vary substantially both from State to State and within a State.
 Subscribership 
is also particularly low among certain segments of our society. Approximately one-third of African-American and
Hispanic households with annual incomes of less 
than $5,000 lack telephone service, as compared to twenty percent of white 
households.
 Fifty-three percent of Native American households on 
reservations do not have phones.
 Nearly three-quarters of all phoneless 
households are renters, and fifteen percent of households headed by a person 
under twenty-five years of age are without telephones.
 Finally, in many 
states, some areas have no telephone service at all_not even pay phones.
 

 







21. Statistics such as these have caused many observers to conclude that 
universal service has not been fully achieved in the United States.
 Low 
penetration rates among certain groups appear to result from a variety of factors. 
For example, witnesses at NTIA's Albuquerque, New Mexico, field hearing cited 
the state's low per-capita income as an important cause of the low penetration in 
the area.
 More than sixty-five percent of the households of the Navajo Nation 
in New Mexico do not subscribe to telephone service because telephone service is 
either not affordable or not available.
 Language barriers and the need for 
increased public education, at least among certain groups, may also result in 
reduced telephone service penetration.
 

 






22. We seek further comment on these matters. Are there other underserved 
groups besides those we have mentioned? Are the measures used and types of 
data currently being collected by the Census Department and other government 
agencies adequate for determining whether universal service goals are being met in 
all sectors of society? If so, parties are requested to provide that information for 
the record. If not, what recommendations are there for providing more 
comprehensive and targeted data on these issues? 
 

 23. We also solicit comment (particularly studies, surveys, etc.) on why some 
Americans do not have telephone service. Is income the determining or 
predominant factor? Does subscribership depend to any significant degree on geography (

e.g., 

do penetration levels differ between rural and urban areas after 
controlling for factors like income)? To what extent are cultural factors important? 
If such factors are important, what steps can be taken to overcome them? Do 
different considerations affect a household's ability to retain phone service over 
time, as compared to its decision to subscribe initially? 
 

 24. Finally, we request comment on whether implementation of universal service 
should be measured in terms of availability of POTS rather than penetration. For 
example, some households may not have telephone service simply because they 
choose not to subscribe. What measure(s), applied on a regular basis for 
monitoring purposes, would best enable policymakers to distinguish such 
households from those that desire basic service but cannot obtain it?

B. Formulating an Expanded Definition of Universal Service 



25. As the nation decides whether and how to redefine universal service, it is 
important to remember that, to a large extent, the current debate represents but a 
new phase in a continuing process. Although universal service has traditionally 
been defined as voice-grade POTS, the minimally-acceptable characteristics of that 
service have changed over the past sixty years. Thus, direct dialing became 
popular as it obviated the need to make more expensive operator-assisted calls in 
many instances and regulators mandated lower rates for directly-dialed calls. 
Party-line service has been replaced in recent decades by single-line service. Some 
states have directed local exchange carriers to incorporate touch-tone capability 
into their basic service offerings because of its importance in accessing many 
information services. In short, the current interest in redefining universal service is 
consistent with past practice. The principal differences are the ever-expanding 
range of services that could be incorporated into a revised concept of universal 
service and the quicker pace at which policymakers must make their decisions. 

26. As noted above, there appears to be strong public support for expanding the 
existing definition of universal service. There is, however, little consensus about 
what services, features, and capabilities should be included within a new 
definition. Witnesses at the NTIA field hearings suggested that universal service 
encompass a host of different services, including: access to a basic set of 
information and telecommunications services; multiple languages, including 
Spanish and Native American languages that require special, non-ASCII
 characters; set-aside resources, facilities, and capacity for public, education, and 
government training and use; new technologies such as video link and cellular 
telephone service; and services defined as characteristics or features, rather than 
technologies.
 A random survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted by the 
Benton Foundation found that Americans are very interested in educational and 
informational services.








27. If universal service is to be redefined as a group of services or capabilities, 
some mechanism or set of principles must be found to help select from the wealth 
of possible alternatives. We therefore request comment on whether there is an 
organizing principle or set of principles that can be used to determine whether a 
particular service or feature should be included within a modern concept of 
universal service. This is essential because redefinition is not without potential 
pitfalls. Adding each new component to the package deemed universally 
necessary increases both the societal costs of making that package universally 
available as well as the chances of prematurely mandating services or features that 
are ultimately proven to be commercially undesirable.






28. One approach could be to allow the marketplace to identify, at least in the 
first instance, services and features that warrant inclusion in an expanded 
definition of universal service.
 Under this approach, private firms would offer 
services to consumers in competition with other companies. If some service were 
subscribed to by a predesignated minimum percentage of U.S. households, 
government regulators would either have the authority to consider whether to 
make that service universally available or be required to do so.
 We seek 
comment on whether government should select services to be included in an 
expanded definition of universal service and, if so, on what basis such services 
should be chosen? What role should the market play in determining that mix? 
Should there be some threshold of market penetration before a capability or service 
is added to the definition of universal service? If so, what should the threshold be 
and why? Are there disadvantages in relying on market forces even in the first 
instance? 







29. An alternative to identifying particular services to be incorporated into an 
expanded concept of universal service would be to define universal service in terms 
of a network connection that would enable customers to access any service 
available via such network. If universal service were to be defined in such a 
fashion, the cost of making it available throughout the country would likely be 
reduced. Moreover, government officials would not be required to make difficult 
determinations about the relative value of different services or equipment; instead, 
it should allow the market to determine customer valuation of each service or 
equipment item. On the other hand, government officials may have to make 
equally difficult decisions as to the type of network connection that should be 
provided. 

30. We request comment on the notion of defining universal service in terms of 
a network connection. Would such an approach effectively spur deployment of an 
advanced telecommunications infrastructure? Would it give all sectors of society a 
chance to participate in the information revolution? If this approach were adopted, 
what sort of connection should be specified (

e.g., 

in terms of capacity, 
transmission speed, signalling, etc.)? 

31. The notion of defining universal service as customer access to a 
telecommunications network raises the issue of access to the Internet, which 
began in 1969 as a Pentagon experiment to aid researchers in trading information 
by computer. Today the Internet is a worldwide network linking over 21,000 
separately administered computer networks. Each computer network connects 
tens of thousands of computers with ten million users in the United States and 
fifteen million users in sixty countries around the world.
 One observer recently asserted:

<PARENT> FR940919-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Not knowing how to use the Internet will be as grave a deficiency as 
not knowing how to read. The Internet will become the world's 
primary means of communication and will soon carry more mail than 
the entire postal service worldwide.





If universal service is defined in terms of a network connection, should that connection provide access to the Internet?


32. Another important area of inquiry is the extent to which universal service 
policy should address customer premises equipment (CPE). Without adequate 
equipment on the customer's premises, network connection and the many services 
it affords is meaningless. CPE capable of providing access to advanced services 
may be expensive at market prices, however, and thus could serve as a barrier to 
the availability of advanced services. For the same reason, however, subsidizing 
CPE as part of universal service could be expensive, possibly prohibitively so. 


Including CPE in the definition of universal service could also reverse the 
government's existing regulatory approach toward CPE, which is now deregulated 
and subject only to market forces.
 Local exchange carriers may provide CPE in 
conjunction with local telephone service, subject to certain safeguards. In 
addition, at present, computer manufacturers, set-top box manufacturers, and 
television manufacturers are competing to develop the product or products that 
could be used for receiving advanced services. It is thus not clear which 
equipment the government should specify, if any, and on what basis it should 
choose. Moreover, government selection of a certain type of CPE for inclusion 
within the universal service definition carries with it the risk of government picking 
winners and losers, a questionable strategy. 





33. We seek comment on whether CPE should be included in the new definition 
of universal service, and, if so, whether a category of providers should be obligated 
to supply it. Should the Government identify specific equipment or merely 
capabilities if it is included in the definition? What other alternative approaches 
could be adopted, e.g., such as a voucher system, which would assure that all 
consumers could purchase the type of CPE they desire from the provider of their 
choice without government specification?

IV. Funding Universal Service in a Competitive Environment 



34. Today, most experts agree that current pricing policies support universal service by generating subsidies that
reduce the costs of providing POTS in particular areas and make service more affordable for certain groups of customers.
By and large, such subsidies have been internally generated_

i.e.

, created by setting the pricing of certain services above the costs of providing them_rather than funded by external
sources, such as taxes.
 The growth of competition, which to some extent reduces the need for subsidies and is by no means incompatible with
universal service, does put pressure on existing funding mechanisms. Above-cost pricing creates market opportunities
for new entrants. New entry, in turn, drives prices towards costs, in the process, eliminating excess revenues that
were available, prior to competitive entry, to subsidize universal services like POTS. The challenge for policymakers
is to develop funding mechanisms that help achieve universal service goals, but are sustainable in a competitive
environment.

35. While there is widespread agreement that competition is putting pressure on existing mechanisms for funding
universal service, there is no consensus on the amount of subsidies at risk.
 Thus, a study sponsored by the United States Telephone Association concluded that interexchange access and toll
services provided by local exchange telephone companies (LECs) are priced to produce approximately $20 billion
of contribution in excess of their long-run incremental costs.
 Those additional revenues are presumably needed to fund universal service. Teleport Communications Group (Teleport),
a major provider of competitive local telecommunications services, disputes this claim, contending that only $400
million of the LECs' $86 billion in annual revenues goes toward subsidizing rates for basic telephone service.
 A study done for MCI estimated that the subsidy is about $3.7 billion when basic service costs are examined and extraneous
LEC revenue requirements are subtracted.
 Finally, the Consumer Federation of America alleges that, far from requiring support from other services, local
telephone service produces net income for the LECs in the amount of five to ten dollars per month.










36. We ask for comments on the amount of the subsidy today and the basis for the estimates. What methodologies were used
to derive the estimates cited, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? What data sources are available
on which to base the estimates? What are the implications of universal service subsidies in terms of market inefficiencies
and the positive ``externalities'' generated by the addition of subscribers to the network? With respect to a system
of subsidies, is there a threshold point at which the net positive benefits to society are maximized? 

37. There is a similar lack of agreement concerning possible new mechanisms for funding universal service, although
certain themes have begun to emerge. The debate overwhelmingly centers on the sources and distribution of the funding,
since most parties appear to agree that some form of universal service support should be continued.
 The following discussion highlights some of the proposals that are currently under discussion. 





A. Sources of Contribution 



38. Many proposals focusing on potential funding sources look to service providers as a source of subsidies. For example,
NARUC's Universal Service Project Group contends that as markets continue to evolve toward competition, all service
providers that deliver services over the public switched network should be required to contribute proportionally
to the universal service support mechanisms, including enhanced service providers.
 Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS), another provider of competitive local telecommunications services, would require
contributions from all providers of telecommunications services.
 Teleport, on the other hand, suggests that all common carriers providing facilities-based, two-way telecommunications
contribute to funding universal service.
 Professor Eli Noam has developed a plan under which all entities providing ``transmission path services'' to third
parties for compensation would pay a proportionate share, based on revenues, toward universal service funding.
 








39. We request comment on these and other mechanisms for generating funds to support universal service. What are the
advantages and disadvantages of deriving universal service support funding from service providers? What criteria
should be used to determine which service providers should be required to contribute to universal service funding?
Should contributions be required only from facilities-based service providers and, if so, why? If contributions
are to be required from non-facilities based service providers (

e.g.

, resellers, enhanced service providers), do steps have to be taken to prevent double payment? How can the contribution
scheme be structured so as to minimize adverse effects on competition?
 Finally, should we keep any of the existing funding mechanisms? 





40. Some have suggested public funding as an alternative to obtaining universal service funding from service providers.
For example, Professor Noam lists a variety of tax measures that could be used to fund universal service (

e.g.

, general tax revenues, a telecommunications sales tax, a tax on telecommunications equipment, or a property tax
on carriers), while pointing to problems with each.
 Some witnesses at the NTIA field hearings asserted that subsidies should be generated from tax-based funding under
ideal circumstances, with a sectoral levy on telecommunications as a second best option.
 Finally, at NTIA's Indianapolis hearing, an executive of Procter and Gamble suggested that commercial advertising
on the NII could be an alternative mechanism for funding universal service objectives.

41. We request comment on the advantages and disadvantages of using public funding to advance universal service goals.
While that approach would be competitively neutral, public funding would represent a sharp departure from current
funding policies and would likely encounter stiff opposition, given the Federal deficit and other budget priorities.
We also seek comment on the efficacy of advertising as a vehicle for funding universal service in the 21st century.



B. Distribution of Subsidies 


42. The other facet of universal service funding concerns the distribution of subsidies. Currently, universal service
support is provided in both targeted and untargeted fashions. As noted above, government regulators historically
have mandated above-cost prices for certain services to reduce rates for residential POTS. This approach, however,
effectively subsidizes all residential customers, including those who would be willing and able to pay cost-based
rates for telephone service. Similarly, regulators have also directed subsidies towards high cost areas to ensure
affordable POTS in those areas.
 Once again, this approach benefits all households in high cost areas, whether or not they are low income or would terminate
telephone service if faced with cost-based rates. 




43. Recently, government regulators have developed more carefully targeted funding programs. For example, the
FCC's Link-Up America program allows States to reduce telephone installation charges for qualified households
by as much as $30, as well as to use installment payments for installation charges without any interest charges to the
customer. To date, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia have implemented Link-Up America programs. Funding
of the program this year will be approximately $15.9 million. Under the FCC's Lifeline program, started in 1985, the
FCC matches State rate discounts to eligible subscribers (up to the maximum Federally-mandated subscriber line
charge of $3.50 per month). Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have implemented some form of Lifeline
assistance, at a projected cost of some $119 million in 1994. 
44. Most experts contend that universal support should be provided only to those subscribers who could not otherwise
afford telephone service. Some argue for targeting subsidies to low income users, high cost areas, and special needs
groups.
 NARUC's Universal Service Project recommends continuing some support mechanisms in place today, including targeted
support in low cost areas and direct assistance to end users through Lifeline and Link-up programs.
 Others also support some form of lifeline option to assist low income customers while avoiding subsidizing every
household.







45. We seek comment on how best to target universal support funding. What criteria should be established to identify
those eligible for subsidies? Should eligibility for support be linked to the eligibility standards associated
with other social ``safety net'' programs. Should support be structured so that some defined package of telecommunications
services consumes no more than a specified percentage of a household's annual income, or represents no more than a
designated fraction of a household's yearly expenditures?
 Should subsidies be applied to a limited set of services and, if so, how should that set of services be determined? 




46. We also request comment on the current practice of providing support to firms providing service in high cost (predominantly
rural) areas. Some have argued that rural telephone companies have higher average costs only if one considers the
fixed costs of their telephone networks. When operating expenses (

e.g.,

 labor costs, taxes, interest expenses) are factored in, total costs for some rural companies are lower than the costs
incurred by companies operating in non-rural areas.
 Commenters should address these analyses and their implications for universal service policies in rural areas.





47. In a related vein, MFS suggests that subsidies for high cost areas be based on objective criteria such as population
density, geography, and other subscriber statistics rather than actual telephone company costs to reduce any incentive
of LECs to inflate costs so they can keep receiving subsidies.
 Is that a viable funding strategy? Would it be more efficient to direct support to rural households, thereby subsidizing
only those subscribers who could otherwise not afford telephone service? 





48. Finally, we solicit comment on the appropriate recipients of universal service support. As noted above, subsidies
are directed towards the providers of telephone service, in return for their commitment to provide below cost service
to certain subscribers or in certain areas. Some observers have suggested providing subsidies directly to subscribers,
either as a complement to or in place of transfers to carriers. There is growing interest, for example, in a voucher
system to allow subsidies to be distributed directly to eligible subscribers who would choose their own providers.
 Similarly, there is a proposal to give eligible customers credits on their monthly bills to reflect reductions in
the price of basic service.






49. Directing support to end users, rather than to carriers, could give customers more control in choosing their providers,
while continuing to ensure that all have access to affordable service. It might also stimulate competitive entry
in some areas. Others have argued, however, that providing support to subscribers would encourage inefficient entry
by new firms, jeopardize incumbent providers' ability to serve remaining customers, and actually increase universal
service support requirements.





50. Should universal service support payments be made to service providers, to subscribers, or in some other fashion?
Would directing subsidies to carriers encourage inefficient entry in some areas? If so, under what conditions? Could
a subscriber-based subsidy program be structured to avoid such problems? How much would such a program cost to establish
and operate? If support payments are made to service providers, should they be limited to certain categories of providers,
such as ``carriers of last resort'' (

i.e.,

 firms that agree to provide universal services throughout an entire geographic area)? If so, would it be feasible
or efficient to designate (and provide subsidy payments to) multiple carriers of last resort in a particular area?
What rules should dictate when carriers of last resort can enter or exit geographic areas? What is the most effective
way to establish service in currently unserved areas? For example, would it be possible to award a franchise to service
an unserved area via competitive bidding? What minimum franchise requirements would be necessary to make such an
auction fair and attractive to potential bidders?

C. Transition Measures


51. Establishing a new funding scheme will likely necessitate transitional measures. For example, if any rate rebalancing
occurs, it will be necessary to address potential ``rate shock'' to local ratepayers. One commenter contends that
any transition should be aimed at achieving two goals: (1) developing a level playing field for competitors and (2)
continuing to protect consumers. Ameritech proposes to use what it calls the ``Customers First Plan,'' based on what
Ameritech labels ``bulk billing.'' In effect, Ameritech would collect the necessary subsidy amount by billing long
distance carriers according to their share of the total toll revenues reported to the FCC for all of Ameritech's interstate
access customers. Ameritech urges this approach as a transition to long-term reform of universal service funding
mechanisms.
 We request comment on this approach, as well as on other transitional proposals. How should these mechanisms be structured
so as not to distort competitive markets?




V. Role of the Federal and State Governments in Developing Universal Service Policies


52. Traditionally, FCC and state regulators have worked in tandem to promote universal service goals, but responsibility
for defining the precise components of universal service has resided primarily with the States. The telecommunications
reform legislation pending in Congress would specify differing degrees of Federal-State cooperation. The Senate
bill, S. 1822, would charge the FCC with defining universal service, ``based on recommendations from the public,
Congress, and the Federal-State Joint Board,'' although it would authorize the States to prescribe requirements
over and above the federally-established minimum as long as such regulations are not inconsistent with those prescribed
by the FCC.
 The House bill, H.R. 3626, would delegate the task to the FCC and the States, based on recommendations from the Joint
Board.






53. Similarly, most funding proposals recognize the joint role of the FCC and the states, given the bifurcated regulatory
jurisdiction over telecommunications. For example, both bills now pending in Congress, H.R. 3626 and S. 1822, require
the involvement of the FCC and the States in determining new universal service funding mechanisms, although the final
distribution authority between the two levels of government will turn on the specific legislative language enacted.
Many parties stress the need for administration of a funding mechanism by a neutral third party from the private sector.





54. There are numerous arguments for allowing more or less federal or state authority over universal service policies.
Defining universal service on a nationwide basis, for example, could facilitate network planning and service deployment,
thereby reducing the total costs to society of implementing universal service. On the other hand, giving individual
states flexibility to adopt differing definitions and funding mechanisms, as is the case today, would allow them
to craft policies more in line with local conditions. Allowing for state experimentation might also reduce the risks
of mandating provision of services either unnecessarily or prematurely, and or leave room for creative funding mechanisms
that might reduce the total subsidy requirement. We request comment on the appropriate role of the Federal and State
government in defining and funding universal service. What role should be played by the private sector?



VI. Open access for Telecommunications and Information Systems



55. The development and convergence of new telecommunications and information technologies are also leading to
changes in the way people think about access to the ``network.'' The concept of ``open access'' has come to represent
technical, regulatory, and empowerment components. This section examines these evolving concepts of open access
and the policies that can help make them a reality.
56. Historically, access has focused on issues such as physical access to a seamless and transparent web of monopoly
local exchanges, equal access to long distance carriers,
 and availability to and ease of use by consumers, among others. As a result, any telephone customer can initiate as
well as receive phone calls, regardless of the local exchange and long-distance carrier serving the caller and the
call recipient. This ``open system'' that we all take for granted has been achieved through a framework of policies
designed to promote interconnection and interoperability, such as expanded interconnection and a uniform system
of ``addresses'' (

i.e.,

 telephone numbers).






57. The Administrations's open access goals are broader and more multi-faceted than the traditional approach. In
the evolving competitive marketplace, open access will require that multiple telecommunications and information
providers as well as users can interconnect transparently and be interoperable. This will in turn promote even more
competition among information providers and service options for consumers. Thus, as the NII evolves, the Administration
seeks to ensure that consumers and service providers will be able to transfer information across disparate networks
easily and accurately, with seamless, interactive, user-driven operations. Also, to be truly useful, an advanced
information infrastructure must allow service providers to offer a full range of educational material, health information,
and home and business services, and it must make those services truly accessible without unreasonable technical
or regulatory barriers, particularly to disabled individuals.

<DOCNO> FR940919-2-00195 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940919-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

58. We solicit comments on how open access should be defined at this time. How should an open access policy be shaped
to accommodate the changing needs of our information society? What impact will open access have on competition and
ultimately on the extent of the need for universal service regulation? How can policymakers ensure that the NII fulfills
its promise for education, economic growth and job creation? How will the new entrants in the market affect open access?
What steps can be taken to facilitate or ensure access by Americans with disabilities?

59. The Administration also envisions open access to a two-way system of broadband communications as a means of individual
empowerment. The idea is that improved access to information will build and promote the values of democracy.
 Open access in this new environment creates opportunities for potential service providers as well as users to be providers
of information, thereby promoting an enhanced concept of community involvement and competition in the free flow
of ideas. Thus, open access to the NII could spur development of community-driven grass-roots networks or ``electronic
commons.'' In addition, the NII will enhance the ability of the Federal government and state and local governments
to deliver information and services to citizens more effectively, and for citizens to communicate their views on
legislation and policy initiatives back to government officials just as easily.





60. How can the ``electronic communities'' envisioned by the Administration be fostered? How can access to the NII
be assured for individuals, small and large businesses, non-profit institutions (in particular, schools, libraries
and health care facilities) and state and local governments? How can access be assured in rural areas? Should there
be different access opportunities and prices for profit and non-profit entities? Large and small entities? How can
society ensure that our citizens are sufficiently ``computer literate'' to utilize the NII?

61. The critical question facing policymakers is how to ensure open access to the NII.
 NTIA's field hearings revealed a general consensus among witnesses that significant issues such as interconnection,
 interoperability and standard open interfaces,
 and reasonable prices and tariffs
 need to be addressed before open access can be assured.










62. The NII will integrate and build upon many different hardware and software components, some of which already exist
and many of which are still in development. These components must be interoperable, i.e., able to work together. Interoperable
components would allow distinct networks to communicate with each other and allows users to access various products
and services through standard software and hardware.
 An NII comprised of interoperable networks will create an infrastructure that is accessible to all providers and
users.
 What critical points in today's infrastructure must be interoperable if the NII vision is to be successfully implemented?
What role, if any, should open or standard interfaces and protocols play? What role can government play in facilitating
interoperability, both in the short term (

e.g., 

two years) and in the long term.






63. Interoperability can be accomplished in a number of different ways. Equipment can have open protocols and interfaces
that permit a physical connection (as is the case of a plug and socket) or logical connection (message format and exchange
procedure).
 Equipment built with open architecture will also permit interoperability. Additionally, standards for voice,
video, data and multi-media services are also crucial to interoperability.

64. While there have been times when the U.S. government has promoted particular standards, industry adoption of
voluntary standards, working with government officials, is now the norm. Various commenters have argued that either
approach can be too slow given the fast pace of change in the industry. In addition, some argue that the industry standard-setting
process is costly and requires large amounts of employee time, which creates hardships for smaller companies.
65. How should standards develop for the NII? Do standards affect the ability to innovate? How can standards be developed
that are flexible and adaptable enough to meet user needs at affordable costs? If voluntary, industry-set standards
are the favored approach, what procedures should be followed in establishing standards, and what fora should be used?
What role, if any, should the government play?
66. Competition is one of several means of ensuring that innovation and the provision of information and transport
services will flourish on the NII. At the same time, there is a recognized need for government intervention in the case
of market failures, for example, to protect new entrants from the market power of incumbent operators when necessary.
Will greater competition in information and transport markets alone be sufficient to achieve open access goals?
If not, what other actions are necessary? What regulations or policies need to be in place to guarantee reasonable
and nondiscriminatory interconnection and reasonable cost-based pricing and tariffs for the NII? What technical
or regulatory barriers must be overcome?


VII. Conclusion


67. NTIA hereby requests comments in this inquiry to be filed on or before December 14, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announces the availability of educational loan repayment under the National
Institutes of Health Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Research Loan Repayment Program. The Program,
which is authorized by section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288-1), as added by the Health
Omnibus Programs Extension Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-607) and amended by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization
Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-43), provides for the partial repayment of the accumulated educational loan debt of
health professionals who agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to AIDS. The Program provides
for the repayment of up to $20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals
for each year of obligated service. The purpose of the program is the recruitment and retention of highly qualified
health professionals conducting AIDS research as NIH employees. The NIH, through this notice, invites health professionals
interested in engaging in AIDS research as NIH employees to apply for participation in the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment
Program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43) was enacted on June 10, 1993,
amending section 487A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 288-1). Section 487A directs the Secretary
to continue a program of entering into agreements with appropriately qualified health professionals under which
such health professionals agree to conduct, as employees of the NIH, research with respect to acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) in consideration of the Federal Government agreeing to repay, for each year of service, not more than
$20,000 of the principal and interest of the educational loans of such health professionals. This program is known
as the NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. 


Under the Program, the NIH will repay qualified educational loan debt incurred by health professionals to pay for
their undergraduate, graduate, and/or medical educational expenses. Upon application, individuals must have
total qualified debt which will exceed 20% of their anticipated annual NIH salary (``debt threshold'') on the date
of program eligibility. Half of this debt threshold amount will not be repaid by the Program and will remain the obligation
of the participant. 
The remaining repayable debt of qualified health professionals will be satisfied at the rate of one-third per year,
subject to a statutory limit of $20,000 per year, for each year of obligated service EXCEPT for individuals with repayable
debt equal to or less than $10,000. These individuals will receive repayment of their repayable debt at the rate of
one-half per year. Obligated service requires individuals selected to participate in the Program to agree to serve
at least 2 years as an NIH employee engaged in qualified AIDS research. Participants may apply for renewal contracts
in one-year increments to satisfy their remaining repayable debt.

In return for the repayment of their educational loans, participants must agree to (1) Engage 

primarily 

in qualified AIDS research as employees of the NIH for a minimum period of 2 years; (2) make payments to lenders on their
own behalf for periods of Leave Without Pay (LWOP); (3) pay monetary damages as required for breach of contract; and
(4) satisfy other terms and conditions of the Program's contract and application procedures. Applicants must submit
a signed contract, prepared by the NIH, agreeing to obligated service at the time they apply for consideration under
the Program. Substantial monetary penalties will be imposed for breach of contract. 

Since program participation is contingent upon employment with the NIH, an individual who wishes to apply must obtain
a written commitment from an Institute, Center, or Division (ICD) Personnel Office of the NIH to be employed in a qualified
AIDS research position. Current deadlines, sources for assistance, and additional details regarding application
procedures are published in an annual 

Applicant Information Bulletin 

which is available from the Director, AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program. 
 The Loan Repayment Committee (LRC), whose members are appointed by the Director, NIH, review, rank, and approve or
disapprove the scientific portions of Loan Repayment Program applications. The LRC is composed of NIH scientific
staff and chaired by the Associate Director for AIDS Research, NIH. Review and selection of applications for approval
is based upon the following: 
 (1) The appropriateness of the research assignment to qualified AIDS research; 
 (2) The scientific merit of the research assignment; and 
 (3) The credentials of both applicant and supervisor and other criteria the Secretary deems appropriate. 

Initial contracts will be executed to cover a two-year service period. At the conclusion of this initial contract,
participants may be recommended for a one-year renewal contract, subject to review of their AIDS research accomplishments.
These continuation contracts may be approved on a year-to-year basis. Funding of all contracts is contingent upon
appropriation and/or allocation of funds from the U.S. Congress and/or the NIH. 
The NIH will repay lenders for the principal, interest, and related expenses (such as the required insurance premiums
on the unpaid balances of some loans) of qualified Government (Federal, State, local) and commercial educational
loans obtained by participants for the following: 
(1) Undergraduate, graduate, and health professional school tuition expenses; 
(2) Other reasonable educational expenses required by the school(s) attended, including fees, books, supplies,
educational equipment and materials, and laboratory expenses; and 
(3) Reasonable living expenses, including the cost of room and board, transportation and commuting costs, and other
reasonable living expenses as determined by the Secretary. 
Repayments will be authorized quarterly for direct payment to lenders, following receipt of (1) The supervisor's
verification of completion of the prior period of obligated service and (2) lender verification of the crediting
of prior loan repayments, including the resulting account balances and current account status. The NIH will repay
loans in the following order unless significant savings would result from repaying loans in a different priority
order: 
(1) Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL); 
(2) Other loans guaranteed by the Federal Government; and 
(3) Other qualifying loans. 
The following loans are NOT repayable under the Program: 
(1) Loans not obtained from a Government entity or commercial lending institution, such as loans from friends and
relatives, or other private individuals; 
(2) Loans for which contemporaneous documentation is not available; and 
(3) Loans, or those portions of loans, obtained for educational or living expenses which exceed a ``reasonable''
level as determined by a review of the standard school budget for the year in which the loan was made. 
In addition, for other programs which provide loans, scholarships, loan repayments, or similar awards in exchange
for a future service obligation, the NIH will 

NOT 

repay any sums that may result from failure to serve as required or conversion of the obligation to a loan under these
programs. This includes, but is not limited to the following: 
(1) Physicians Shortage Area Scholarship Program; 
(2) National Research Service Award Program; 
(3) Public Health Service and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Programs; 
(4) Armed Forces (Army, Navy, or Air Force) Health Professions Scholarship Programs; and 
(5) Indian Health Service Scholarship Program. 
Finally, payments will 

not 

be made under the Program for loans which participants have already repaid, delinquent loans, loans in default, loans
not current in their payment schedule, or loans for which promissory notes have been signed after the program eligibility
date. During lapses in loan repayments, due either to administrative complications or a break in service, Program
participants are wholly responsible for making payments or other arrangements which maintain loans in a current
payment status such that increases in either principal or interest do not occur. Penalties assessed participants
as a result of NIH administrative complications may be considered for reimbursement. 


Activities Constituting AIDS Research 


The following parameters define whether a proposed research assignment meets the criteria for coverage under the
NIH AIDS Research Loan Repayment Program_that is, whether the incumbent will be ``primarily'' engaged in AIDS research.
``Primarily'' engaged in AIDS research is defined as AIDS research activities that constitute at least 80% of a researcher's
time. Clinical Associates, whose intent is to primarily engage in AIDS research, must engage in qualified AIDS research
for at least three months in the first year of their program, with a total of fifteen months of qualified AIDS research
during their two-year contract. AIDS researchers include registered nurses who are principal or associate investigators
in AIDS research studies. 

(1) AIDS research includes studies of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathophysiology of HIV infection,
the development of models of HIV infection and its sequelae, cofactors predisposing to HIV infection and AIDS, or
its sequelae, and the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Specifically, the following research activities
are included: 
a. Studies of HIV and related retroviruses; 
b. Studies of the mechanism(s) by which HIV and related retroviruses establish infection and infect host cells;

c. Studies of the mechanism(s) by which HIV and related retroviruses cause disease, including studies of the immune
deficiency induced by HIV and related retroviruses; 
d. Studies of the pathophysiology of host response to HIV infection; 
e. Studies of 

in vivo

 or 

in vitro

 models of human HIV infection and its sequelae; 
f. Epidemiologic studies of HIV and related retrovirus infection; 
g. Clinical trials involving prophylaxis or therapy for HIV infection or its sequelae; 
h. Preclinical studies aimed at the development of therapy for or prevention of HIV infection and the immunodeficiency
caused by HIV infection and its sequelae; 
i. Cofactors predisposing to acquiring HIV infection and/or the progression of HIV-related disease; 
j. Basic studies and clinical trials involving vaccines, or other immunological or chemotherapeutic interventions
for the prevention of HIV infection and its sequelae; 
k. Studies into the transmission of HIV involving high risk behaviors and research concerning the interruption of
transmission by behavioral change and pharmacologic intervention; and 
l. Basic studies of the societal impact of and response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including subgroups within the population.

(2) AIDS researchers include scientists who are intellectually engaged in the process of providing scientific direction
and guidance in programs of original AIDS research, specifically, epidemiologists, statisticians, and others
who are involved in the design and conduct of research studies. The duties of such scientists may include the generation
and design of studies and collation and analysis of data; and/or the preparation and publication, as author or co-author,
of studies in peer-reviewed journals. 
(3) AIDS researchers include physicians and registered nurses who are providing care for HIV-infected individuals
who are subjects of HIV-related research.

Federal Communications Commission






Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review; Notice









Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 180  Monday, September 19, 1994  Notices






<USDEPT>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review 



September 14, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for
review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037 (202) 857-3800. For further information
on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission (202) 418-0214. Persons wishing
to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 10236
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503 (202) 395-3561.






Please note: 

The Commission has requested expedited OMB review of this item by September 21, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR
1320.18.






OMB Number: 

3060-0604.



Title: 

Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act_Competitive Bidding, Third Report and Order and Third
Memorandum Opinion and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, PP Docket No. 93-253 (47 CFR Part 24).



Action: 

Revised collection.



Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, non-profit institutions and businesses or other for-profit
(including small businesses).



Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement(s) and recordkeeping requirement.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

10-17,770 responses, .50-20 hours average burden per response, 41,100 hours annual burden; 4,554 recordkeepers,
1 hour average burden per recordkeeper, 45,654 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses: 

On May 20, 1994, the OMB approved the collections of information contained in the Third Report and Order which established
service-specific rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services
in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband PCS'') and the general procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service.
The Commission received seven petitions for reconsideration of the Third Report and Order and three oppositions
and comments and on reply. Upon reconsideration, the Commission has clarified, modified and supplemented the original
rules governing the auction of narrowband PCS licenses. For example, the Commission has modified its original definition
of small business to include larger concerns, and has codified principles for attributing the interests of various
affiliates of the applicant to that applicant. The Commission has also modified the various preferential measures
that are available to certain entities designated by Congress, such as increasing the available bidding credits
to 40% from 25% in some cases. In order to better ensure that applicants claiming these preferences are entitled to
them and to aid the Commission's enforcement efforts, winning bidders are now required to supply additional information
on the ownership of the applicant. The FCC Form 175, now permits applicants to amend their FCC Form 175 applications
to reflect ownership changes that do not result in a change in control of the applicant. The Commission believes that
the new and modified rules and requirements will facilitate the auction process and will increase the opportunities
for designated entities to participate in the provision of narrowband PCS. The rules and requirements have been carefully
crafted as to not unduly burden any applicant with unnecessary paperwork requirements. We estimate that each applicant
will take an additional five (5) hours to comply with the new and modified paperwork requirements. If the normal 60-day
OMB review and clearance process for information collections were followed, it would effectively impede the Commission's
ability in achieving Congressional objectives of encouraging rapid deployment of service, efficient use of the
spectrum, enhancing access to telecommunications services, and ensuring that spectrum based services are available
to a wide range of consumers. It would also thwart the Commission's ability to recover for the public a portion of the
value of the public spectrum. The result would be an unnecessary delay in the anticipated benefits to the public. The
revised rule sections are in the following Appendix are provided in this notice as required by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980.

(f) Unjust Enrichment. Designated entities using installment payments, bidding credits or tax certificates to
obtain a narrowband PCS license will be subject to the following unjust enrichment provisions:

(1) If a small business paying for a narrowband PCS license in installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a
non-small business entity during the term of the license, the remaining principal balance must be repaid as a condition
of the license transfer.

(2) If a licensee that utilizes installment financing under this section seeks to make any change in ownership structure
that would result in the licensee losing eligibility for installment payments, the licensee shall first seek Commission
approval and must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal and any unpaid interest accrued through the
date of the change as a condition of approval. Increases in gross revenues that result from equity investments that
are not attributable to the licensee under  24.320(b)(2)(iv), revenues from operations, business development
or expanded service shall not be considered changes in ownership structure under this paragraph.
