NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 









Technical Specifications

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations pertaining to technical specifications
for nuclear power reactors. The proposed rule would codify criteria for determining the content of technical specifications.
These criteria were developed in recognition of the overly broad use of technical specifications to impose requirements,
diverting both NRC and licensee attention from the more important requirements in these documents to the extent that
it has resulted in an adverse but unquantifiable impact on safety. Each licensee covered by these regulations may
voluntarily use the criteria as a basis to propose the relocation of existing technical specifications that do not
meet any of the criteria from the facility license to licensee-controlled documents. The voluntary conversion of
current technical specifications in this manner is expected to produce an improvement in the safety of nuclear power
plants through a reduction in unnecessary plant transients and more efficient use of NRC and industry resources.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Section 182a. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (Act), as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232), mandates the inclusion of technical
specifications in licenses for the operation of production and utilization facilities. The Act requires that technical
specifications include information concerning the amount, kind, and source of special nuclear material, the place
of use, and the specific characteristics of the facility. That section also states that technical specifications
shall contain information the Commission requires through regulation to enable it to find that the utilization of
special nuclear material will be in accord with the common defense and security and will provide adequate protection
of public health and safety. Finally, that section requires technical specifications to be made a part of any license
issued. 

The Commission promulgated  50.36, ``Technical Specifications,'' which implements Section 182a. of the
Atomic Energy Act on December 17, 1968 (33 FR 18610). This rule delineates requirements for determining the contents
of technical specifications. Technical specifications set forth the specific characteristics of the facility
and the conditions for its operation that are required to provide adequate protection of the health and safety of the
public. Specifically,  50.36 requires the following:

 


Each license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility of a type described in  50.21 or
 50.22 will include technical specifications. The technical specifications will be derived from the analyses
and evaluation included in the safety analysis report, and amendments thereto, submitted pursuant to  50.34.
The Commission may include such additional technical specifications as the Commission finds appropriate.

Technical specifications cannot be changed by licensees without prior NRC approval. However, since 1969, there
has been a trend toward including in technical specifications not only those requirements derived from the analyses
and evaluation included in the safety analysis report but also essentially all other Commission requirements governing
the operation of nuclear power reactors. This extensive use of technical specifications was due in part to a lack of
well-defined criteria (in either the body of the rule or in some other regulatory document) for what should be included
in technical specifications. This use has contributed to the volume of technical specifications and to the several-fold
increase in the number of license amendment applications to effect changes to the technical specifications since
1969. It has diverted both NRC staff and licensee attention from the more important requirements in these documents
to the extent that it has resulted in an adverse but unquantifiable impact on safety. 

On March 30, 1982 (47 FR 13369), the NRC published in the 

Federal Register 

a proposed amendment to part 50. The proposed rule would have revised  50.36, ``Technical Specifications,''
to establish a new system of specifications divided into two general categories. Only those specifications contained
in the first general category as technical specifications would have become part of the operating license and would
have required prior NRC approval for any changes. Those specifications contained in the second general category
would have become supplemental specifications and would not have required prior NRC approval for most changes. The
NRC review of the first general category of specifications would have been the same as that currently performed for
technical specification changes, which are amendments to the operating license. For the second category, supplemental
specifications, the licensee would have been allowed to make changes within specified conditions without prior
NRC approval. The NRC would have reviewed these changes when they were made and would have done so in a manner similar
to that currently used for reviewing design changes, tests, and experiments performed under the provisions of  50.59.
Because of difficulties with defining the criteria for dividing the technical specifications into the two categories
of the proposed rule and because of other higher priority licensing work, the proposed amendment was deferred. 

In the early 1980s, the nuclear industry and the NRC staff began studying whether the existing system of establishing
technical specification requirements for nuclear power plants needed improvement. During this time frame, an NRC
task group known as the Technical Specifications Improvement Project (TSIP) and a Subcommittee of the Atomic Industrial
Forum's (AIF) Committee on Reactor Licensing and Safety performed two studies of this issue.
 The overall conclusion of these studies was that many improvements in the scope and content of technical specifications
were needed and that a joint NRC and industry program should be initiated to implement these improvements. Both groups
made specific recommendations which are summarized as follows: 

 



(1) The NRC should adopt the criteria for defining the scope of technical specifications proposed in the AIF and TSIP
reports. Those criteria should then be used by the NRC and each of the nuclear steam supply system vendor owners groups
to completely rewrite and streamline the existing Standard Technical Specifications (STS). This process would
result in the transfer of many requirements from control by technical specification requirements to control by other
mechanisms [e.g., the final safety analysis report (FSAR), operating procedures, quality assurance (QA) plan]
that would not require a license amendment or prior NRC approval when changes were needed. The new STS should include
greater emphasis on human factors principles in order to make the text of the STS clearer and easier to understand.
The new STS should also provide improvements to the bases section of technical specifications, which gives the purpose
for each requirement in the specification. 

(2) A parallel program of short-term improvements in both the scope and substance of the existing technical specifications
should be initiated in addition to developing new STS as stated in Recommendation (1). 

On February 6, 1987 (52 FR 3788), the NRC published in the 

Federal Register 

for public comment an Interim Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors
containing proposed criteria in response to Recommendation (1). These criteria were generally derived from the
criteria proposed in the AIF and TSIP reports and were modified slightly on the basis of discussions between the NRC
staff and the industry. The public comment period for the interim policy statement expired on March 23, 1987. 

The criteria were developed with the intention that they would apply to limiting conditions for operation (LCOs).
The NRC staff believed that the safety limits needed to remain as is in the technical specifications because of their
more direct link to protection of the physical barriers that guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity.
At the time the criteria were developed, the industry did not wish to address administrative controls and design features
in the effort to improve the STS. Later, however, both the industry and the NRC staff realized that it would be beneficial
to include upgraded administrative controls and design features in the improved STS, and these were handled separately
from the application of the criteria to the LCOs. 

The NRC has developed a program for short-term improvements as described in Recommendation (2). These are known as
``line-item'' improvements and are generic improvements developed and promulgated by the NRC staff for voluntary
adoption by licensees. 

Subsequently, improved vendor-specific STS were developed and issued by the NRC in September 1992. The improved
STS were published as the following NRC reports: 

 NUREG-1430, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Babcock and Wilcox Plants''

 NUREG-1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants'' 
 NUREG-1432, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Combustion Engineering Plants'' 
 NUREG-1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4'' 
 NUREG-1434, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/6'' 

Copies of NUREGs may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, by calling

37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service,
5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 

These improved STS were the result of extensive technical meetings and discussions among the NRC staff, industry
owners groups, vendors, and the Nuclear Management and Resources Council (NUMARC). 

Finally, on July 22, 1993 (58 FR 39132), the Commission published a Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications
Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, which incorporated experience and lessons learned since publication
of the interim policy statement. The interim policy statement identified three criteria to be used to define which
of the current technical specification requirements should be retained or included in technical specifications
and which LCOs could be relocated to licensee-controlled documents, as follows: 

Criterion 1: Installed instrumentation that is used to detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal
degradation of the reactor coolant pressure boundary. 

Criterion 2: A process variable, design feature, or operating restriction that is an initial condition of a design
basis accident or transient analysis that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of
a fission product barrier. 

Criterion 3: A structure, system, or component that is part of the primary success path and which functions or actuates
to mitigate a design basis accident or transient that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity
of a fission product barrier. 

The interim policy statement also stated that, in addition to structures, systems, and components captured by the
three criteria, it was the Commission's policy that licensees retain in the technical specifications LCOs for a specified
list of systems that operating experience and probabalistic safety assessment had generally shown to be important
to public health and safety. In the final policy statement, the Commission retained this thought as a fourth criterion
to capture those requirements that operating experience or probabilistic safety assessment show to be significant
to public health and safety. The final policy statement also addressed comments received on the interim policy statement
and described the Commission's intent with regard to use of the criteria and their codification through rulemaking.


The Commission believes that amending  50.36 to include the four criteria contained in the final policy statement
could codify a viable, potentially safety-enhancing and cost-saving method for technical specification improvement.
The Commission encourages licensees to use the improved STS as the basis for plant-specific technical specifications.
As stated in the final policy statement, the Commission will place the highest priority on requests based on the criteria
for individual license amendments that are used to evaluate all of the LCOs for an individual plant to determine which
LCOs should be included in the technical specifications. Related surveillance requirements and actions would be
retained for each LCO that remains in the technical specifications. Each LCO, action, and surveillance requirement
should have supporting bases. 

In addition, the Commission will also entertain requests to adopt portions of the improved STS, even if the licensee
does not adopt all STS improvements. These portions will include all related requirements and will normally be developed
as line-item improvements by the NRC staff. The Commission encourages all licensees who submit technical specification
related submittals based on these criteria to emphasize human factors principles. 

LCOs that do not meet any of the criteria, and their associated actions and surveillance requirements, may be proposed
for relocation from the technical specifications to licensee-controlled documents, such as the FSAR. The criteria
may be applied to either standard or custom technical specifications. The Commission will also consider the criteria
in evaluating future generic requirements for inclusion in technical specifications. 

During individual technical specification conversions, a backfit analysis will be performed in cases of nonvoluntary
addition of new requirements from the improved STS to individual plant technical specifications, unless the staff-suggested
additional changes are needed to make the changes requested by the licensee acceptable from the standpoint of adequate
protection or compliance with NRC regulations, in which case the request may be denied without the additional items.


The Commission requests comments on the criteria being proposed for inclusion in  50.36 and, particularly,
on Criterion 4 and what guidelines the Commission should use in defining ``significant to public health and safety.''




Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 



The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission
regulations in Subpart A of Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment and would not degrade the environment in any way. Therefore, the Commission concludes
that there will be no significant impact on the environment from this proposed rule. This discussion constitutes
the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for this proposed rule; a separate assessment
has not been prepared.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement


This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-0011.


Regulatory Analysis


The Commission has determined that a regulatory analysis is not required for this proposed rule. The Commission believes
the intent of the regulatory analysis has been met through the extensive consideration given to the development of
the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and the improved
STS, both of which involved an opportunity for public comment. The criteria being added to  50.36 are identical
to those contained in the final policy statement and have been used by the NRC and the nuclear power industry to define
the content of technical specifications since September 1992. The criteria will continue to be used even if this proposed
rule is not adopted. The proposed rule does not impose any requirements but, rather, allows nuclear power reactor
licensees to voluntarily use the criteria to relocate existing technical specifications that do not meet any of the
criteria to licensee-controlled documents. The NRC staff also uses these criteria to determine whether technical
specifications are appropriate to provide continued regulatory control over new requirements or positions that
have been justified consistent with the backfit rule.
The Commission considered the need for and consequences of this proposed action when it made the decision to not only
publish the criteria in the final policy statement but also to codify the criteria through rulemaking. Appropriate
alternative approaches to this action have been identified and analyzed over the life of the Technical Specifications
Improvement Program, beginning with an earlier attempt to define the content of technical specifications through
rulemaking. As described in the background discussion, the Commission published a proposed amendment to  50.36
(47 FR 13369) on March 30, 1982. However, because of difficulties with defining criteria for technical specifications
and because of other higher priority licensing work, the rule change was deferred. In February 1987, the Commission
published an interim policy statement on Technical Specification Improvements and in July 1993, published the final
policy statement. During review of the final policy statement, the Commission concluded that the four criteria should
be codified in a rule. Thus, alternative approaches to regulatory objectives have been identified and analyzed,
and the Commission has decided that there is no clearly preferable alternative to codifying the four criteria in a
rule. With regard to evaluation of values and impacts of alternatives, the Commission believes there is no difference
in the values or impacts of implementing the criteria through use of the final policy statement or through a rule, except
that the criteria are more readily available to future users in a rule than in a policy statement.


Regulatory Flexibility Certification


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 [5 U.S.C. 605(b)], the Commission certifies that, if promulgated,
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule
affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies that own these plants do not fall within
the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' as given in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business
Size Standards in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR part 121.


Backfit Analysis


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule,  50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, a
backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would impose backfits
as defined in  50.109(a)(1).


List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50


Antitrust, Classified information, Criminal penalties, Fire protection, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear
power plants and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.



For the reasons given in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 553, the NRC is proposing to adopt the following amendment to Part
50.

(c) * * *
(2) 

Limiting conditions for operation.
(i) Limiting conditions for operation are the lowest functional capability or performance levels of equipment required
for safe operation of the facility. When a limiting condition for operation of a nuclear reactor is not met, the licensee
shall shut down the reactor or follow any remedial action permitted by the technical specifications until the condition
can be met. When a limiting condition for operation of any process step in the system of a fuel reprocessing plant is
not met, the licensee shall shut down that part of the operation or follow any remedial action permitted by the technical
specifications until the condition can be met. In the case of a nuclear reactor not licensed under  50.21(b)
or  50.22 of this part or fuel reprocessing plant, the licensee shall notify the Commission, review the matter,
and record the results of the review, including the cause of the condition and the basis for corrective action taken
to preclude recurrence. The licensee shall retain the record of the results of each review until the Commission terminates
the license for the nuclear reactor or the fuel reprocessing plant. In the case of nuclear power reactors licensed
under  50.21(b) or  50.22, the licensee shall notify the Commission if required by  50.72 and shall
submit a Licensee Event Report to the Commission as required by  50.73. In this case, licensees shall retain
records associated with preparation of a Licensee Event Report for a period of three years following issuance of the
report. For events which do not require a Licensee Event Report, the licensee shall retain each record as required
by the technical specifications.
(ii) A technical specification limiting condition for operation of a nuclear reactor must be established for each
item meeting one or more of the following criteria:
(A) Criterion 1. 

Installed instrumentation that is used to detect, and indicate in the control room, a significant abnormal degradation
of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.
(B) 

Criterion 2. 

A process variable, design feature, or operating restriction that is an initial condition of a design basis accident
or transient analysis that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of a fission product
barrier.
(C) 

Criterion 3. 

A structure, system, or component that is part of the primary success path and which functions or actuates to mitigate
a design basis accident or transient that either assumes the failure of or presents a challenge to the integrity of

Criterion 4. 

A structure, system, or component which operating experience or probabilistic safety assessment has shown to be
significant to public health and safety.
(iii) A licensee is not required to modify technical specifications that are included in any license issued before
[THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE] to satisfy the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. However, for
technical specification amendments a licensee proposes after [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], the criteria
in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section provide an acceptable scope for limiting conditions for operation.
(3) 

Surveillance requirements. 

Surveillance requirements are requirements relating to test, calibration, or inspection to assure that the necessary
quality of systems and components is maintained, that facility operation will be within safety limits, and that the
limiting conditions for operation will be met.

Annual Reports by Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'').




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed amendments to form and request for comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is requesting public comment upon proposed amendments to Form U-13-60, the annual report
filed by service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (``Act''). The proposed amendments would clarify the requirements for these reports and improve the disclosure
of financial, accounting and operational information.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission is requesting comment on proposed amendments to Form U-13-60 [17 CFR Part 259] under the
Act [15 U.S.C. 79 

et seq

.]. The Annual Report for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies on Form U-13-60 was adopted December
29, 1939 and last revised on February 22, 1980 (Holding Co. Act Release No. 21447). 




I. Introduction 




Service company subsidiaries of registered holding companies serve the needs of associate companies by providing
managerial, administrative, technical and other services. Section 13(b) of the Act requires that contracts by which
service companies perform services or construction work for, or sell goods to, associate companies must be performed
at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among such companies.

1 








Commission rules set forth accounting and reporting requirements with respect to these intrasystem transactions.
Under rule 93, the accounts and records of a service company subsidiary of a registered holding company must be consistent
with the accounts required by the Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual and Subsidiary Service Companies (``Uniform
System of Accounts'').

2 

Rule 94 requires the filing of an annual report on Form U-13-60 by every service company.

3 









On November 4, 1992, the Commission, as part of its efforts to update and streamline regulation under the Act, proposed
certain amendments to Form U-13-60.

4 

The proposed amendment was intended to provide the service companies with the flexibility to use accounts from the
Uniform System of Accounts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC System of Accounts'') in preparing
the Form U-13-60.

5 









The Commission received six comment letters addressing the proposed form amendment.

6 

Several commenters noted with approval the purpose of the amendment to provide additional flexibility. The commenters
observed that because the Uniform System of Accounts does not always contain accounts needed to classify properly
charges incurred, the service companies are obliged to use accounts from the FERC System of Accounts or classify certain
categories of costs improperly.

7 

One commenter stated that, at present, service companies are effectively required to maintain two sets of books,
one using the Uniform System of Accounts, the other using the FERC System of Accounts.

8 

The commenter stated that the proposed amendments would greatly simplify the accounting system and permit service
companies to classify costs more accurately. 








Other commenters, however, were concerned as to how the Commission's proposal would harmonize the FERC System of
Accounts with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts. These commenters asked that the Commission clarify its
proposal. In view of these comments, the Commission is today resubmitting the proposal for public comment.

In response to these comments and upon further consideration, the Commission has modified its proposal. Initially,
the Commission had requested comments on the need to amend the Uniform System of Accounts to reflect the proposed changes
to Form U-13-60. On balance, however, it does not appear necessary to amend the Commission's Uniform System
of Accounts in the event that Form U-13-60 is amended. The Commission's Uniform System of Accounts follows
the FERC System of Accounts, with modifications, and contemplates that accounts and financial statements of service
companies will comply with that system.

9 

As the commenters suggest, the proposed amendments to Form U-13-60 will effectively incorporate in the
Uniform System of Accounts additional accounts corresponding to the FERC System of Accounts.

10 









The Commission has modified its proposal to add several new schedules to Form U-13-60 and to modify the
existing schedules by adding new accounts and other requirements. The amendments are intended to result in more detailed
disclosure of certain categories of information, and to ensure generally that accounting for services rendered
to a system utility is consistent with the accounting for such expenses on the utility's balance sheet and income statement.
In addition, the amendments will reduce some regulatory burdens by creating or modifying dollar thresholds for reporting
purposes and by simplifying the reporting requirements.

11






The various accounts proposed to be added to Form U-13-60 correspond, in each instance, to accounts under
the FERC System of Accounts. 







A. Instructions for Use of Form U-13-60 




The Commission proposes to amend the instructions to provide that use of the new accounts is mandatory. The Commission
has considered whether the use of the new accounts should be discretionary or mandatory. On the one hand, the mandatory
use of these accounts could entail additional expense for some companies.

12 

On the other hand, a requirement of mandatory use would help to ensure fuller identification of charges to facilitate
accounting by the associate companies and regulatory examination. The Commission believes that the goal of improved
disclosure should prevail, but invites particular comment on this aspect of the proposed amendments. 






In addition, the amended instructions would require service company charges to be presented in the accompanying
schedules on an ``as billed'' basis.

13 

At present, the costs of a transaction may be classified differently on the financial statements of its associate
company customers. For example, salary expenses associated with the construction of a transmission line may be classified
as expenses on the income statement of the service company but as capital items on the balance sheet of the associate
company. Consistent treatment of these items should aid ratemakers and others in identifying service company charges
on the financial statements of associate public-utility companies. The Commission requests comment, in particular,
on the need for a phase-in period of up to three years for this requirement.

B. Schedule II, Service Company Property 


The Commission proposes to add a new Account 101.1_Property Under Capital Leases to this schedule.

14 

Capitalized lease assets are not currently reported in Form U-13-60. The amendment is necessary to provide
disclosure concerning this significant category of service company property. There would be a corresponding amendment
to Schedule I, the balance sheet.

15








C. Schedule IV, Investments 


Currently, Schedule IV contains three accounts: Account 123_Investment in Associate Companies; Account 124_Other
Investments; and Account 136_Temporary Cash Investments. The Commission proposes to add a new Account 128_Other
Special Funds. Account 128 would include investments that have been segregated in special funds for insurance, employee
pensions, savings, relief, hospital, and other purposes not provided for elsewhere. The proposed amendment would
provide detail, currently lacking, with respect to these investments. 



D. Schedule V, Accounts Receivable 


Schedule V requires the reporting of accounts receivable from associate companies in Account 146_Accounts Receivable
From Associate Companies. The Commission is proposing to amend the instructions to Schedule V to require identification
of associate company receivables that have been outstanding for 60-90 days and for more than 90 days from the
due date. Companies that do not pay in a timely manner are effectively subsidized by the other system companies that
do timely pay. The Commission believes that the proposed amendment will encourage service companies to adopt administrative
controls to ensure that receivables are collected within ninety days. 
The Commission has proposed a $25,000 threshold for reporting under this account but requests comment on whether
a higher threshold, such as a $50,000 limit, as suggested by AEP, would be more appropriate. 
In addition, the Commission is proposing to amend Schedule V to add a new Account 143 that would require the reporting
of accounts receivable from nonassociate companies, to provide more complete information in this area. 


E. Schedule XIV, Statement of Income 



This schedule, currently under Schedule XV, requires the reporting of the income and expenses of the service company.
Because the schedule does not contain any balance sheet accounts, a service company cannot necessarily report an
item in a manner consistent with its treatment on the books of the associate company customer. As a result, commenters
have noted that service companies are effectively required to maintain two sets of books, one for purposes of Form
U-13-60 and the Uniform System of Accounts, and another to comply with the FERC System of Accounts.

16 

The Commission is concerned that the current system results in unnecessary expense and duplication of effort for
system companies. 




Accordingly, the Commission proposes to include two categories of expenses, one relating to the income statement
and the other relating to the balance sheet. A number of new accounts would be added to the present income statement
accounts. Specifically, the amendment would add new Accounts 500-557_Power Production, Accounts 560-598_Transmission
& Distribution Expenses, Accounts 901-905_Customer Accounts, and Accounts 906-917_Customer
Service & Information. New accounts would also be added in Accounts 927_935_Other Administrative and General
Expenses, Accounts 403_407_Depreciation and Amortization, Accounts 409_411.4_Income Taxes, Accounts 426.1_426.5_Other
Deductions, and Accounts 427_431_Interest Expense. In addition, the amended schedule would include the following
balance sheet accounts: Account 107_Construction Work in Progress, Accounts 108-115_Accumulated Provision
for Depreciation, Account 163_Store Expenses Undistributed, Account 174_Miscellaneous Current & Accrued
Assets, Account 183_Preliminary Engineering, Account 186_Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, Account 188_Research
& Development, and an unnumbered account for other balance sheet expenses. The Commission also proposes to add
a new income account, Account 419_Interest Income. 


F. Schedule XV, Analysis of Charges-Direct vs. Indirect 


Under the current schedule, service companies must report the amount of charges to associate and nonassociate companies,
and categorize the charges as either direct (

i.e., 

a charge for a specific service provided to a customer) or indirect (

i.e., 

an allocated charge for an overhead expense of the service company). The Commission proposes to amend the schedule
to require consistent treatment of a charge on the books of the service company and its associate company customers,
to eliminate unnecessary expense and duplication of effort in system company accounting. 


G. Schedule XX, Other Administrative & General Expenses 


Account 930.1_General Advertising Expenses and Account 930.2_Miscellaneous General Expenses are currently reported
in separate unnumbered schedules. The Commission has found that separate reporting for these items is unnecessary
since historically the amounts involved have been immaterial. The Commission proposes to combine the existing schedules
in a new Schedule XX which would require a detailed description of these expenses and other service company billings
corresponding to Accounts 927-935 of the FERC System of Accounts.

17 






H. Schedule XXII, Other Deductions 


The Commission proposes to combine the requirements of Account 426.1_Donations, and Account 426.5_Other Deductions,
and add Account 426.2_Life Insurance, Account 426.3_Penalties, and Account 426.4_Expenditures for Certain Civic,
Political and Related Activities in a new Schedule XXII. 
The new schedule would require more detailed reporting in Account 426.5 to the extent that the annual aggregate amount
of other deductions exceeded $25,000. The Commission believes that $25,000 is an appropriate threshold but requests
comment on the need for a higher or lower threshold. 
In addition, the Commission proposes to modify the reporting requirement for Account 408_Taxes, Other than Income
Taxes. Based on its experience in this area, the Commission believes it is appropriate to eliminate the requirement
of detailed reporting. Instead, the account will appear as a single line item on proposed Schedule XIV, the income
statement. 


I. Schedule XXIII, Miscellaneous Income or Loss 


Schedule XV, the current income statement, requires the reporting of income or loss other than from services rendered
to associate and nonassociate companies in Account 421_Miscellaneous Income or Loss. Although significant amounts
of income and loss have been reported in this account, service companies at present are not required to disclose the
source of the income or the cause of the loss. To obtain such information, the Commission proposes to create a new Schedule
XXIII that will require a detailed description of the items contained in Account 421.


J. Schedule XXIV, Interest Expense 



Interest expense is reported on present Schedule XV in Account 427_Interest on Long-Term Debt, Account 430_Interest
on Debt to Associate Companies, and Account 431_Other Interest Expense, and on Schedule I, the balance sheet, in Account
237_Interest Accrued. The Commission proposes to create a new Schedule XXIV that would differentiate between long
and short term debt interest expense, and require more detailed information concerning the debt and debt holders.
The new schedule will enable the Commission to monitor the overall cost of capital of the service companies. 


K. Schedule XXV, Notes to Financial Statements 


The notes to financial statements and notes to statement of income are furnished in current Schedules XIV and XVIII,
respectively. The Commission believes it is more appropriate for the notes to appear in a single schedule, and so proposes
to create a new Schedule XXV for this purpose. 


L. Schedule XVIII, Outside Services Employed 


The Commission also proposes to amend this schedule to require separate itemizations of legal, auditing and other
services. 


M. Other Matters 


The Commission proposes to amend certain schedules to include a footnote that the amounts referenced in these schedules
include charges to both income statement and balance sheet accounts. The footnotes would cross-reference the expenses
related to the income statement of new Schedule XIV for a more particular breakdown of these expense items.

18 






Finally, certain schedules would be renumbered, and the format of some items slightly changed.

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman of the Commission has
certified that the proposed amended Form will not, if adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This certification, including the reasons therefor, is attached to this release. 


III. Costs and Benefits 


The proposed amendments to Form U-13-60 would enable the seventeen service company subsidiaries of registered
holding companies to prepare income statements and balance sheets that properly reflect the accounting of the billings
to their utility customers. The enhanced ability to properly classify billings should ease the record keeping burdens
presently incurred by the service companies and would permit service companies to classify costs more accurately.

In addition, the proposed amendments would provide the service companies the flexibility to use FERC Accounts as
appropriate given the nature of the services provided their customers. The Commission anticipates that these benefits
will reduce the accounting costs of a service company by $10,000 to $20,000 per year. 


IV. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed amended Form U-13-60 is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and will be submitted to the
Office of Management and Budget. 


V. Statutory Authority 


The Commission is proposing amendments to Form U-13-60 pursuant to sections 14, 15, and 20(a) [15 U.S.C.

Wyoming Regulatory Program



<AGENCY>

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule; reopening and extension of public comment period on proposed amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a second request regarding required amendments to the Wyoming permanent regulatory
program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
Wyoming is requesting OSM to extend the required amendments' time frames at 30 CFR 950.16 (bb) through (gg), that concern
shrub density reclamation standards.



This document set forth the times and locations that the Wyoming Program and the proposed extension request to that
program are available for public inspection and the comment period during which interested persons may submit written
comments on the proposed extension request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Wyoming Program



On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15, and 950.16.



II. Discussion of Proposed Extension



On February 28, 1994, Wyoming DEQ requested an extension of the time frames at 30 CFR 950.16 (bb) through (gg) to enter
into a negotiated rule making process (Administrative Record No. WY-26-1). OSM announced the receipt
of this request in the March 21, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 13286), and sought public comment on whether the proposed extension request satisfied the applicable program
approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15.

Wyoming DEQ has now completed the negotiated rule making process, only to be notified by the State Attorney General's
office that the proposed rule is in conflict with two sections of existing statutes [W.S. 35-11-402(b)
and (c)] and that conflict prohibits DEQ from promulgating the rules until the statutes are changed. 

In view of this opinion, and on September 1, 1994, the State of Wyoming, Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ)
submitted a second request to extend the time frames at 30 CFR 950.16(bb) through (gg), as codified in the January 24,
1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 3521), in order to allow the State time to introduce new statutory changes to the Wyoming Legislature during
the 1995 Legislative Session (Administrative Record No. WY-26-7). 
Wyoming DEQ has prepared the required modifications to the statutory language for submission to the Wyoming Legislature's
Mines and Minerals Committee for sponsorship in a bill to be introduced during the next Legislative Session which
begins in January 1995. 

Wyoming is requesting an extension to November 1995. The State's request outlines a time line schedule from October
1994 to November 1995. The schedule identifies milestones such as: When the Mines and Minerals Committee received
the proposed statutory changes from DEQ: submission of the proposed rule to the Land Quality Advisory Board; introduction
to the Legislature for debate; approval by the Governor; required revisions to the rule based on Statutory changes;
required 45 days comment period; Environmental Quality Council hearing; and, submittal of a formal State Program
amendment to OSM in November 1995. 

OSM is now considering Wyoming's request to further extend the time frames and is seeking public comments on whether
the proposed extension can and should be granted. 



III. Public Comment Procedures 


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed extension request
satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the extension request is deemed adequate,
it will become part of the Wyoming program. 

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Casper Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record. 



IV. Procedural Determinations 


1. Executive Order 12866 



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review). 



2. Executive Order 12778 



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Revisions to Standards for Palletization 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; notice of public meeting. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to requests from postal customers, the Postal Service has decided to hold a public meeting to facilitate
the receipt of comments regarding a proposal to implement revised Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards prohibiting
mailer use of ``courtesy'' pallets (pallets that do not meet DMM standards). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 18, 1994, the Postal Service published proposed rule changes in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 42536-42540) to amend Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the preparation of mail on pallets.
See also the notice published in the proposed rule section of the 

Federal Register

 on September 19, 1994. That notice extended the period for comment on this proposal to November 3, 1994. 



The proposed revisions are intended to establish consistent preparation standards for all classes of mail that result
in the lowest combined costs of handling palletized mail for the Postal Service and its customers as well as to facilitate
consistent service for palletized mailings. Numerous customers have indicated that implementation of the provisions
prohibiting courtesy pallets would have catastrophic implications for their businesses and have requested an opportunity
to present their views and concerns in person regarding the provisions in the proposed rule change pertaining to courtesy
pallets. 

The Postal Service generally does not hold, nor does it generally find a need for, public meetings concerning proposed
rules. Nevertheless, in this limited instance, the Postal Service has determined to grant the request for a public
meeting. Interested parties may, of course, submit written comments in accordance with the instructions in the 

Federal Register

 notice. Comments submitted at the meeting may be written or oral. Oral comments will be transcribed for future reference
and will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in room 8430
at U.S. Postal Service Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 20260-6808. Individuals wishing
to present comments are asked to limit their oral presentations to 10 minutes.

 Clean Air Act Limited Approval/Limited Disapproval and Promulgation of Emission Statement Implementation Plans
for New Hampshire 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a limited approval/limited disapproval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of New Hampshire. This revision establishes an emission statement program for stationary sources throughout
the State. New Hampshire's submittal includes amendments to Chapter Env-A 900 (Parts 901-903). This action
proposes limited approval of New Hampshire's Chapter Env-A 900, ``Owner and Operator'' for the purpose of strengthening
the New Hampshire SIP. In addition, this action proposes limited disapproval of New Hampshire's Chapter Env-A 900
(Parts 901-903) since the regulation fails to meet all requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is
being taken pursuant to section 110 of the CAA. Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on
EPA's proposal of a limited approval/limited disapproval. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport
areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA
intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for
ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation
of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NOx Supplement to the General Preamble'')). EPA has also issued a draft
guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this Notice entitled
``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also conducting
a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program. 


II. Analysis of State Submission 


A. Procedural Background 


The Act requires each state to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission
statement program will become a part. Section 110(l)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted
by a State under the CAA must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA must at the outset
determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1)
and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as
amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). 
The State of New Hampshire held a public hearing on June 18, 1992. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted
by the State on November 13, 1992 and submitted to EPA on December 21, 1992 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The SIP revision
was reviewed by EPA and deemed complete on February 19, 1993. 


B. Components of Emission Statement Program 


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and the specific source requirements detailed below. 


1. SIP Revision Submission 


EPA requires States to submit their SIP revisions within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAAA) (November 15, 1990). New Hampshire submitted its SIP revision on January 12, 1993. 


2. Reporting Requirements for State 


In addition to the program elements applying to sources, the SIP should include a provision that requires States to
provide EPA the identifying information for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for
rule effectiveness utilized by the State in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and
quarterly emission statement status reports. The minimum source identification information should include the
AIRS code, the AFS point number (ID), the AFS segment number (ID), and the Source Category Code (SCC) and descriptions
for each segment. In addition, States should supply to EPA the current rule effectiveness (RE) factors at the SCC pollutant
level, if applicable, and the RE method codes. The emission statement data submittal to AIRS should include all data
obtained from the source and the State. These source-supplied data elements include source identification information
(name, physical location, mailing address of the facility, latitude and longitude, and 4-digit Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) code(s)), operating schedule information (percentage annual throughput, days per week on
the normal operating schedule, hours per day during the normal operating schedule, and hours per year on the normal
operating schedule), process rate data (annual process rate (annual throughput) and peak ozone season daily process
rate), control equipment information (current primary and secondary control equipment identification codes and
current combined control equipment efficiency (%)), and emissions information (estimated actual VOC and NOx emissions
at the segment level (in tons per year for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season day),
estimated emissions method code, calendar year for the emissions, and emission factor (if used)). EPA recommends
that the States electronically submit emission statement data into the AIRS database no later than July 1 of each year,
commencing in 1993. The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission
statements program requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Quarterly reports
should be submitted commencing no later than July 1, 1993. New Hampshire has not committed to submitting emission
statement data to EPA by July 1 of each year. EPA will negotiate with New Hampshire to include a submittal date and requirement
for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants. 
New Hampshire has not required source identification information, operating schedule information, control equipment
information, process data information, and annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all potentially subject
source categories. New Hampshire only requires source identification information and operating schedule information
from surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c), gasoline storage and degreasing facilities under
Env-A 901.05(b), and fuel combustion and incinerator sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(1) and 901.06(c)(3). Under
Env-A 901.04(h), New Hampshire requires all facilities with add-on VOC control equipment to keep records of control
equipment information, but not to report this information. Facilities with add-on NOx control equipment are required
to record this information under Env-A 901.06(c)(6). New Hampshire only requires process data information from
surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c)(5) and combustion sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(4).
Recordkeeping, but not reporting, is required for gasoline storage sources under Env-A 901.04(e)(1) and degreasing
facilities under Env-A 901.04(g)(2). New Hampshire only requires annual and typical ozone season day emissions
from surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c)(7), and combustion sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(5).
This is also required from degreasing sources under Env-A 901.04(g)(4), however, sources are not required to report
this information, only to keep records. No emissions reporting requirements were made for VOC/gasoline storage
or for other types of sources. 


3. Sources Covered 


Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone require emission statement
data from all sources of VOC or NOx in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all classified ozone nonattainment
areas, regardless of the classification (Marginal, Moderate, etc.). Section 184(b)(2) of the Act extends the requirements
for major stationary sources in moderate ozone nonattainment areas to sources in the ozone transport region. Section
182(f) extends the requirements for major stationary sources of VOC in ozone transport regions to major sources of
NOx. The emission statement requirement covers sources in attainment areas and nonattainment areas which are not
classified within the ozone region which emit, or have the potential to emit, 100 tpy or more of NOx or 50 tpy or more of
VOC. 
New Hampshire is located in the ozone transport region. Emission statement regulations must apply State-wide, and
cover all stationary sources which emit or have the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC or 100 tpy of NOx. In addition, New
Hampshire has three classified ozone nonattainment areas and are therefore subject to the more stringent source
threshold requirement of section 182(a)(3)(B). The area which includes all of Merrimack County, part of Hillsborough
County, and part of Rockingham County, is classified Marginal. The second nonattainment area includes all of Strafford
County and part of Rockingham County, and is classified as Serious. Finally, a portion of New Hampshire is in the Boston-Lawrence-Salem
Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), which is also classified as Serious. This includes a range of
cities and towns from Nashua to Exeter in portions of Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties. For these classified
ozone nonattainment areas, the States' emission statement regulations must cover all sources which emit VOC or NOx.

For classified ozone nonattainment areas, the States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission
statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NOx or VOC emissions
in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions
are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42) or other
methods acceptable to EPA. New Hampshire does not waive the emission statement requirement for sources emitting
less than 25 tons per year of NOx or VOC emissions. New Hampshire requires certain sources that have potential emissions
of less than 25 tons per year to supply their data and information required for calendar year 1992 by April 15, 1993.
In addition, these sources are required to submit emission statements for every third calendar year, beginning with
1995, by April 15 of the following year. All NOx emitting sources that are required to submit emission statement information
under EPA's guidance are covered in New Hampshire's regulation. Under Env-A 901.07, fuel burning devices, as well
as miscellaneous sources having theoretical potential NOx emissions of at least 25 tpy, are required to submit information
on an annual basis. 
However, New Hampshire's regulation does not address all VOC sources recommended in EPA's guidance. Since New Hampshire
is located in the ozone transport region, emission statement regulations must apply State-wide and cover all sources
which emit or have the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC. In addition, New Hampshire has three classified ozone nonattainment
areas and are therefore subject to the more stringent source threshold requirement of section 182(a)(3)(B). These
classified nonattainment areas must require emission statement data from all sources of VOC in the nonattainment
areas unless New Hampshire waives, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement for classes or categories
of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide VOC emissions in nonattainment areas. In Env-A 901.05(d),
emission statements are required to be submitted for sources which are subject to the recordkeeping requirements
of Env-A 901.04 and the applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03. The applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03 cover
sources subject to EPA's existing control technique guideline (CTG) documents and other miscellaneous sources
that have the potential to emit more than 50 tpy of VOC. Env-A 901.04 covers the following sources: Any source required
to be permitted under 603.02(g) (surface coating, metal cleaning, or printing); 601.02(h) (VOC storage tanks);
603.02(i) (gasoline terminal loading racks); or any other paragraph of 603.02 which pertains to VOC emitters, with
the exception of sources exempted by Env-A 901.03(a)(4). Env-A 901.03(a)(4) excludes from recordkeeping requirements,
those sources using No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, natural gas, or electrical energy. Under New Hampshire's rules, the requirements
for emission statements do not apply to miscellaneous VOC source categories (i.e., non-CTG) unless those sources
are covered by Env-A 603.02. Only non-CTG sources that are coating or printing sources subject to 603.02(g) are covered
by New Hampshire's emission statement program. 
In addition, the applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03 only cover graphic arts printing, and non-CTG sources with
potential VOC emissions greater than 50 tpy. Therefore, if certain non-CTG sources have actual VOC emissions greater
than 25 tpy, but potential emissions less than 50 tpy, they would not be covered by New Hampshire's program. 
Furthermore, New Hampshire's emission statement rule specifically excludes sources with VOC emissions resulting
from combustion of No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, or natural gas. As a result, New Hampshire has not required all sources that
emit or have the potential to emit more than 50 tpy of VOC to submit emission statements. Additionally, if either VOC
or NOx is emitted at or above the statutory reporting level, the other pollutant must be included in the emission statement,
even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. New Hampshire did not include this requirement in its rule.
New Hampshire's rule was proposed in May 1992 and EPA provided comments in June 1992. However, this requirement was
not clearly stated in EPA's emission statement guidance until July 1992. Therefore, New Hampshire was unaware of
this requirement at the time the regulation was proposed. 


4. Reporting Requirements for Sources 


Sources covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a minimum, the data elements described
under section II.B.2 of this document. 
The emission statement submitted by the source should contain a certification that the information is accurate to
the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. EPA recommends that the State program require the
submission of the data from the sources no later than April 15 of each year. 
Env-A 901.05(d)(1) and 901.07(b)(1) require sources subject to the emission statement requirement to submit data
for the calendar year 1992 by April 15, 1993. Furthermore, these sections require that information for each subsequent
calendar year be submitted by April 15 of the following year. New Hampshire does require a certification of data accuracy
under Env-A 901.04(b) and 901.06(b), however, this certification is not required to accompany the emission statement
forms. In a June 24, 1992 comment letter, EPA commented ``the certificate of data accuracy shall state, at a minimum,
that the records required by Env-A and maintained at the facility are true and accurate. Also, the certificate of data
accuracy must be submitted with each emission statement.'' New Hampshire's rule only requires that the certification
be kept on the premises. 


5. Reporting Forms 


Although EPA has developed a proposed format for the emission statement reporting process in its guidance document,
the Act allows States to develop their own format for emission statement reporting. New Hampshire has not specified
a format in which facilities are to submit data. 


III. Proposed Action 


Because of the above deficiencies, EPA cannot grant approval of New Hampshire's rule under section 110(k)(3) and
part D. EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant
to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is
limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval. In order to strengthen the SIP, EPA
is proposing a limited approval of Chapter Env-A 900 ``Owner or Operator Obligations'' (Parts 901-903) under
sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA. 

At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of this rule because it does not fully meet section 182(a)(3)(B)
of part D of the Act. As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State will have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval
to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose one of the two sanctions
set forth in section 179(b) of the Act: either highway sanctions or new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected
its deficiencies within 6 months after imposition of the first sanction, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any
sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has met the 1990 Amendments requirements.
Note also that any final rulemaking disapproving the State's submission will trigger the requirement for EPA to impose
a Federal implementation plan within two years of disapproval as provided under section 110(c)(1) of the Act. 


IV. Request for Public Comments 


Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on EPA's proposal of a limited approval/limited disapproval.
Public comments received by October 20, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.



V. Administrative Requirements 


A. Executive Order (EO) 12866 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989. 54 FR 2214-2225. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions, 54 FR 2222, from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: 
Municipal Waste Combustors 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of public hearing.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing a new subpart Eb to regulate emissions from new municipal waste combustor (MWC) units for which
construction, modification, or reconstruction began after September 20, 1994.


Today's proposal would implement sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act). The proposed rule would apply to new
MWC units at facilities with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 megagrams per day (Mg/day; a megagram
is a metric ton, and one megagram is equal to 2,204 pounds or about 1.1 short tons) of municipal solid waste (MSW) and
would require sources to achieve emission limits reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants
that the Administrator determines is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission
reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. The proposed rule
establishes emission limits for MWC acid gases (sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) and hydrogen chloride (HCl)), MWC metals (particulate matter (PM), opacity, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury
(Hg)), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), nitrogen oxides (NO

x

), and MWC fugitive fly ash/bottom ash. The proposed rule would also establish standards for MWC operating practices
(carbon monoxide (CO), load, flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet, and operator training/certification)
and siting requirements for new MWC units. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information 


On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed new source performance standards (NSPS) for new MWC's in subpart Ea of 40 CFR
part 60. The subpart Ea NSPS were promulgated on February 11, 1991 and were developed under authority of paragraph
(b) of section 111 of the Act of 1977. The Act of 1990 requires the EPA to review these emission standards and determine
if they are fully consistent with the requirements of section 129. The EPA has reviewed the subpart Ea NSPS and has concluded
that they are not fully consistent with the requirements of section 129 of the Act of 1990. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
a new NSPS in subpart Eb that would fully comply with the requirements of section 129. Municipal waste combustors that
begin construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 20, 1994, and that meet all other applicability
criteria, would be subject to the proposed subpart Eb. Municipal waste combustors that were constructed, modified,
or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 and on or before September 20, 1994, and that meet all other applicability
criteria, would remain subject to the subpart Ea NSPS and would not be subject to the proposed subpart Eb NSPS. Those
sources subject to subpart Ea would, however, also be subject to the emission guidelines that are being proposed under
subpart Cb in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. The proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines would be applicable to sources constructed, modified, or reconstructed
on or before September 20, 1994.

I. Introduction 



This section provides an introduction to the proposed rule by: (1) Summarizing the history of the development of NSPS
for new MWC's over the past 7 years; (2) summarizing the general goals of the proposed rule that are specified by sections
111(d) and 129 of the Act of 1990; and (3) providing a brief overview of the major issues discussed in this preamble.




A. Summary of Regulatory Decisions 



During the early and mid-1980's, several studies were performed to determine whether MWC emissions should be regulated
and, if so, under what section of the Act. As set forth in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (52 FR 25399,
July 7, 1987), the EPA decided to regulate air emissions from MWC's under section 111 of the Act, and based the regulation
on best demonstrated technology (BDT), as required by section 111. On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed NSPS for
new MWC's and emission guidelines for existing MWC's (54 FR 52251 and 54 FR 52209, respectively). On November 15, 1990,
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted and added section 129 to the Act. Section 129 of the Act specifies that
revised NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the requirements of sections
111 and 129. Section 129 further specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines be developed for both large and
small MWC's and that the revised NSPS and emission guidelines must reflect a more restrictive standard of performance.
Section 129 includes a schedule for revising the 1991 NSPS. When the EPA did not comply with that schedule, the Sierra
Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York. The resulting consent decree requires the EPA Administrator to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking
not later than September 1, 1994 and a notice of promulgation not later than September 1, 1995 (Nos. CV-92-2093
and CV-93-0284). 

The NSPS and guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488 and 56 FR 5514, respectively) apply to MWC's with
unit capacities above 225 Mg/day and reflect BDT as determined by the Administrator at the time those standards were
issued. Today's notice therefore proposes to create new NSPS to be fully consistent with sections 111 and 129 of the
Act and to extend coverage of the standards to new MWC units located at MWC facilities with aggregate plant capacity
above 35 Mg/day. Additionally, under a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

, new subpart Cb emission guidelines for existing MWC plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day of MSW are being
proposed pursuant to sections 111 and 129 of the Act. 

Today's proposed NSPS is more stringent than the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991. Today's proposed NSPS would
replace the subpart Ea NSPS for those facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced
after September 20, 1994. However, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect for affected facilities
constructed, modified, or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 and on or before September 20, 1994. Those sources
subject to the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS would also be subject to the emission guidelines being proposed under
subpart Cb in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. In most cases, the proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines are more stringent than the existing subpart Ea standards.




B. New Source Performance Standards_General Goals 



The Act requires the promulgation of performance standards under section 111 for categories of new and existing stationary
sources that may contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.
Section 129 of the Act specifies that NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the
requirements of sections 111 and 129 of the Act. Section 129(a)(2) provides that the revised standards for new MWC's
reflect the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of designated air pollutants, taking into consideration the
cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy
requirements that the Administrator determines are achievable for a particular category of sources (this standard
is commonly referred to as ``maximum achievable control technology, or ``MACT''). Additionally section 129 provides
that standards for new sources may not be less stringent than the emissions control achieved in practice by the best
controlled similar unit. This is referred to as the ``MACT floor.'' The standards themselves are set forth as emission
limits and do not specify what technology must be applied. 



C. Overview of this Preamble 



This preamble will: 

(1) Summarize the proposed standards by discussing the conclusions reached with respect to each of the elements in
the decision summary; 

(2) Describe the environmental, energy, and economic impacts of the proposed standards; 

(3) Present a rationale for each of the decisions associated with this proposal; 

(4) Present a regulatory flexibility analysis; and 

(5) Discuss administrative requirements relevant to this action.

II. Summary of the Proposed Subpart Eb Standards 


This section presents a summary of the proposed NSPS, including identification of the source category and pollutants
that would be regulated under the proposal, discussion of the format of the proposed standards, and presentation
of the proposed standards and their associated performance testing, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
This section also provides a comparison of the emission standards in this proposed subpart Eb NSPS versus the 1991
subpart Ea NSPS. 


A. Source Category to be Regulated 


Today's proposed standards would apply to each MWC unit located at an MWC facility that has an aggregate plant capacity
to combust over 35 Mg/day of MSW, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September
20, 1994. Additionally, under the proposed NSPS, plants with an aggregate capacity to combust between 25 and 35 Mg/day
would be required to submit an initial report of their facility capacities and location, but would not be subject to
any other provisions of the NSPS. Municipal waste combustors that commenced construction, modification, reconstruction
on or before September 20, 1994 are not covered under today's proposed standards, but are being addressed in a separate
notice in today's 

Federal Register

. 


An MWC is defined as any setting or equipment that combusts MSW. Municipal solid waste combustion includes the burning
(or pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of setting or equipment, including combustion equipment with or without heat recovery.
This definition has been slightly modified from the February 11, 1991 NSPS and is discussed below. 

Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream of household, commercial, and/or institutional
discards. This would include materials such as paper, wood, yard wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber,
glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials. The MSW definition includes household discards
as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but does not include industrial process or manufacturing
discards. The definition of MSW also includes refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which is solid waste that is shredded (or
pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. Municipal solid waste does not, however, include wastes that
are solely segregated medical wastes. However, if segregated medical wastes are mixed with MSW, the resulting mixture
remains MSW, and the proposed standards would apply if the aggregate MWC plant capacity exceeded 35 Mg/day capacity.
Minor editing changes are proposed in the definition of MSW to clarify this point. 

Air curtain incinerators that combust MSW are MWC's. However, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes,
tree trimmings, and clean untreated lumber would be covered under a separate set of proposed opacity emission limits,
and no other part of the proposal would apply. Air curtain incinerator opacity requirements are discussed in section
VII of this preamble. 



B. Pollutants to be Regulated 



Section 129 of the Act requires the EPA to establish numerical emission limits specifically for SO

2

, HCl, PM, opacity, Cd, Pb, Hg, dioxins/furans, CO, and NO

X

. Section 129 specifies that the EPA may also 




* * * promulgate numerical emission limitations or provide for the monitoring of post-combustion
concentrations of surrogate substances, parameters, or periods of residence times in excess of stated temperatures
with respect to pollutants other than those listed [above]. * * * 




Therefore, the EPA is proposing standards for load and flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet as additional
indicators of MWC operating practices. The EPA is also proposing a standard for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions
because these emissions include Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans (see section VI of this preamble for further discussion
of the EPA's decision to regulate fugitive emissions from MWC's). 



The February 11, 1991 NSPS includes standards for all of the pollutants listed above except Cd, Pb, Hg, and fly ash/bottom
ash fugitive emissions. The proposed NSPS would establish standards for all of the pollutants listed above. The proposed
standards for the same pollutants regulated by the February 11, 1991 NSPS (i.e., SO

2

, HCl, PM, opacity, dioxins/furans, NO

X

, CO, load, and flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet) would be revised under the proposal to reflect the
requirements of section 129. 



C. Format for the Proposed Standards 



The format of the proposed standards is similar to the format of the February 11, 1991 NSPS. In most cases, the format
is in the form of emission limits (concentrations). 

The February 11, 1991 NSPS specifies emission limits for PM and opacity. Particulate matter is measured as a concentration
(milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm)) and is corrected to 7 percent oxygen (O

2

), and opacity is measured on a percentage basis. The format for the PM and opacity standards would not change in today's
proposal, but Cd, Pb, and Hg emission limits would be added. Emissions of Cd, Pb, and Hg would be calculated as a concentration
(mg/dscm) corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis. For Hg, today's proposed standards would also establish an alternative percentage reduction requirement.
A new method (Method 29) that would measure these pollutants is being proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

.

<TEXT>
 

The February 11, 1991 NSPS establishes control requirements for SO

2

 and HCl (MWC acid gases) by specifying both numerical emission limits and alternative percentage reduction requirements
for both SO

2

 and HCl. The concentration emission limits for HCl and SO

2

 are calculated as parts per million by volume (ppmv) corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis. Today's proposed standards for SO

2

 and HCl would also be based on the same format. 

The February 11, 1991 NSPS addresses a numerical emission limit for NO

X

 emissions. The concentration emission limit for NO

X

 is calculated as ppmv. Today's proposed standard for NO

X

 is based on the same format as the February 11, 1991 NSPS. 

The February 11, 1991 NSPS establishes MWC organics control by specifying an emission limit for dioxins/furans.
The format of the dioxin/furan emission limit would be revised by today's proposal. In the February 11, 1991 NSPS,
emissions of dioxins/furans are calculated as a concentration (nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (ng/dscm))
corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis, on a total mass basis (i.e., the mass of all tetra- through octa- congeners were added together). In today's
proposal, dioxin/furan emissions could be reported either in units of ng/dscm toxic equivalency (TEQ) or in units
of ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans. Reporting in TEQ units is done by first measuring the total mass of dioxin/furan
congeners and then adjusting the results for the toxicity of each dioxin/furan congener. The same test method (Method
23) is used in either case. See section II.F of this preamble for further discussion of the proposed method of reporting
dioxin/furan emissions in terms of TEQ. 

In addition to controlling stack emissions, the February 11, 1991 NSPS also establishes good combustion operating
standards for MWC's. These operating standards are part of good combustion practices (GCP) and ensure that emissions
of MWC organics (dioxins/furans) are minimized on a continuous basis. The GCP requirements are included in today's
proposal, but they are being extended to apply to MWC's at plants of 35 Mg/day aggregate capacity or larger. Additionally,
some minor revisions are being proposed. The proposed revisions would include: (1) A requirement that all shift operators
and chief facility operators obtain full operator certification, (2) ``stand in'' authority for MWC control room
operators, and (3) required training of MWC shift supervisors. These items are discussed below. 

The February 11, 1991 NSPS requires provisional certification of the chief facility operator and shift supervisors
by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) or a State certification program. Development of a site-specific
training manual to be used for training other MWC personnel is also required. Today's proposal would require that
the chief facility operator and shift supervisor obtain both provisional and then full operator certification.


Today's proposal would also allow for the optional certification of one or more control room operators. Under the
February 11, 1991 NSPS, all chief facility operators and shift supervisors shall be certified, and one of these individuals
must be onsite during all periods of MWC operation. Under today's proposal, a provisionally certified control room
operator may ``stand in'' for the chief facility operator or shift supervisor during periods in which the certified
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is offsite, in order to fulfill the requirement that a certified
individual be onsite during all periods of MWC operation. This would provide additional operating flexibility.
Today's proposal would also require that all chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators
complete the EPA or a State MWC operator training course. The EPA has developed a model training program that has been
distributed to State air pollution control agencies, the EPA Regional Offices, and MWC industry groups. The EPA believes
that operator training is an integral part of the implementation of GCP.

Today's proposed standards would establish siting requirements for all new MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities
above 35 Mg/day. These siting requirements would include three components. First, an analysis of the impact of the
facility on ambient air quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation would be required. Second, the siting requirements
would include submittal of a materials separation plan for the area served by the affected facility. Third, the MWC
owner or operator would be required to make both the siting analysis and the materials separation plan available to
the public, hold public meetings to receive comments on the siting analysis and materials separation plan, and respond
in writing to the comments received. These siting requirements were not included in the February 11, 1991 NSPS. See
section V.D of this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the proposed siting requirements. 

Today's proposed standards also establish standards for fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash handling
facilities. The proposed standards would establish visible emissions limits for emissions of ash from buildings
where ash was transferred and from external ash transfer equipment and ash handling areas at the MWC facility. This
requirement was not included in the February 11, 1991 NSPS. 



D. Proposed Standards 



Today's proposal would establish standards for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC metals (PM, opacity, Cd, Pb, and Hg), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), and NO

X

. The proposed standards also include requirements for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive handling, MWC operating practices
(CO, load, and flue gas temperature), operator training and certification, and siting for new MWC units. 

The proposed NSPS would divide the MWC population into two subcategories: The first would be for MWC units located
at small MWC plants (i.e., those with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW but equal to or less
than 225 Mg/day), and the second would be for MWC units at large plants (i.e., those with aggregate capacities to combust
more than 225 Mg/day of MSW). The aggregate capacity of all MWC units at one site constructed after September 20, 1994
would be added together to define aggregate MWC plant capacity for determining NSPS applicability. 

The proposed NSPS for each subcategory of MWC's are summarized in table 1. The proposed NSPS are also discussed briefly
below.

The proposed standards are summarized below. 


1. Municipal Waste Combustor Organics 


The proposed standards for MWC organics would require new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day for which
construction commences after September 20, 1994, but on or before September 22, 1997, to meet a dioxin/furan emission
limit of either 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total mass, at 7 percent O

2

 for the first 3 years following the date of initial startup. Thereafter, the standard would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13
ng/dscm total mass. For MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day for which construction commences after September
22, 1997, the standard at startup would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. Emissions reported in TEQ would
be calculated using the 1989 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) international toxic equivalency factors
(TEF's), using the methods described in section II.F of this preamble and section 60.58b of the proposed subpart Eb
NSPS. 


2. Municipal Waste Combustor Metals 


The proposed standards for MWC metals would require all MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet
a PM emission limit of 15 mg/dscm at 7 percent O

2

. Municipal waste combustors at both large and small MWC plants would also be required to meet an opacity limit of 10
percent based on a 6-minute averaging period. 
The proposed standards would also establish specific emission levels for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed standards would
require new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet a Cd limit of 0.010 mg/dscm, a Pb limit of 0.10
mg/dscm, and an Hg limit of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in potential Hg emissions. These proposed emission
limits are corrected to 7 percent O

2

 on a dry basis. 


3. Municipal Waste Combustor Acid Gases 


The proposed standards for MWC acid gases would require MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to meet an HCl
emission limit of either 25 ppmv or 95-percent reduction (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis). These MWC plants would also be required to achieve an SO

2

 emission limit of either 30 ppmv or 80-percent reduction (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis, on a 24-hour geometric mean basis, measured continuously). 


4. Good Combustion Practices 


Today's proposed NSPS would require all new MWC's at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to comply with specific
operating practices that reflect GCP. These operating practices include CO emission limits, combustor load levels,
and flue gas temperatures at the inlet to the PM control device. 
The GCP CO levels remain basically unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS. For modular starved-air and modular
excess-air types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 50 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn waterwall, mass burn refractory (rotary and fixed-wall),
and fluidized-bed types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary waterwall MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100
ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For RDF-stoker MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For coal/RDF mixed fuel-fired MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at
7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. These limits remain unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS except that
a limit specifically for mass burn rotary refractory units has been added for clarification. 
Municipal waste combustors would be allowed to operate up to 110 percent of the maximum capacity, as achieved during
the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Maximum capacity would be based on the steam flow rate, which would
be continuously monitored according to the ASME Power Test Code (PTC) for Steam Generating Units (PTC4.1 and PTC19.5).
This requirement is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS. The EPA requests comments on this method of measuring
load for steam-generating MWC's. Specifically, the EPA has questions regarding the requirement for calibration
of the measuring device (e.g., orifice plate) before and after each dioxin/furan compliance test. The EPA is concerned
that this calibration requirement may be overly burdensome because the main steam line that contains the orifice
plate may need to be cut in order to access the orifice plate for recalibration. Also, the EPA requests comments on whether
the ASME PTC adequately addresses the need for calibrating the signal from the flow meter.

<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, the EPA requests comments on the use of boiler feed water flow as an alternative method for continuously
monitoring load for steam-generating MWC's. 
Furthermore, the EPA is considering allowing the use of the continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate to measure maximum
capacity for both steam-generating MWC's, as well as those MWC's that do not generate steam. These types of monitors
are based on ultrasonic, thermal, or differential pressure methods, and are now being required as part of the EPA's
Acid Rain Program (40 CFR part 75). The EPA requests comments on whether continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate monitors
are adequately demonstrated and accurate methods for determining compliance with the load level requirements,
and if they should be allowed as an alternative to the use of the ASME PTC. 
Under the NSPS, MWC's would establish a site-specific maximum flue gas temperature at the final PM control device
inlet demonstrated during their most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Similar to the provisions for establishing
a maximum load level measurement, the maximum demonstrated PM control device inlet temperature is established as
the maximum 4-hour block average temperature measured during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. The
MWC must then be operated so that the temperature at the final PM control device inlet does not exceed this level by more
than 17 
 C (30 
 F) (4-hour block average basis). 


5. Operator Certification and Training 


The proposed NSPS would require full operator certification of all MWC shift supervisors and MWC chief facility operators
by the ASME or a State certification program. The proposed standards would also require that at least one of the following
persons be on duty at all times during which the MWC is combusting waste: A fully certified chief facility operator,
a fully certified shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified control room operator. A provisionally certified
control room operator would be allowed to ``stand in'' during times a fully certified chief facility operator or shift
supervisor is offsite. These requirements would become effective on the date of promulgation of the NSPS or 6 months
after startup of a new MWC, whichever is later. 
In addition, the proposed NSPS would require each owner or operator of an MWC plant with an aggregate capacity greater
than 35 Mg/day to develop and maintain a site-specific training manual and to review it with all employees associated
with the operation of the MWC (including MWC maintenance personnel, crane/load operators, and ash handlers). The
manual and training would be updated annually. This site-specific training requirement would be effective on the
date of promulgation of the NSPS or 6 months after startup of a new MWC, whichever is later. 
Section 129 of the Act of 1990 requires the EPA to develop and promote a model program for the training and certification
of MWC operators. Section 129 specifies that ``any person with control over processes affecting emissions from a
unit'' must successfully complete an acceptable training program. Consistent with section 129, today's proposed
revisions would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators to complete
the EPA or a State MWC operator training course before operating an MWC or within 6 months following promulgation of
the standards, whichever is later. The EPA has developed a model training program and has distributed it to State air
pollution control agencies, EPA regional offices, and MWC industry groups. This model training program could be
used to fulfill this requirement and prepare for the ASME certification. 


6. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions 


The proposed standards include a NO

X

 control requirement for MWC's at large plants and would require these MWC's to meet a NO

X

 emission limit of 180 ppmv (corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis, on a 24-hour daily average basis). A ``no control'' NO

X

 emission limit for MWC's at small plants is also proposed and is discussed in section VII of this preamble. 


7. Siting Requirements 


Siting requirements are being proposed for all new MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. These siting requirements
are not included in the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. The siting requirements would include the following three components:
(1) A siting analysis, (2) a materials separation plan, and (3) public meetings. The siting analysis would address
the impact of the facility, taking into account other major industrial facilities near the proposed site, on ambient
air quality, visibility, soils, vegetation, and other factors that may be relevant in determining that the benefits
of the proposed facility significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location
and construction. The materials separation plan would summarize materials separation requirements for the facility
and its service area. Following public meetings on the siting analysis and materials separation plan, the facility
would be required to prepare transcripts of the public meetings and summaries of comments and responses for the public
meetings. 


8. Fly Ash/Bottom Ash Fugitive Emissions 


Standards are proposed for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive dust emissions from ash handling and storage facilities at
all MWC's at plants above 35 Mg/day capacity. The proposed standards would establish a no visible emissions limit
for fly ash/bottom ash handling and would apply to ash handling, conditioning, loading and storage buildings, any
external ash conveyors, ash transfer points, or ash handling activities (e.g., truck loading), and any other area
at the facility that is a potential source of fly ash or bottom ash fugitive emissions. 


E. Comparison of the 1991 NSPS and Today's Proposed NSPS



The subpart Ea NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 and today's proposed subpart Eb standards both include emission
limits for dioxins/furans, PM, SO

2

, HCl, and NO

X

; however, today's proposed standards for most of these pollutants are more stringent than the NSPS promulgated on
February 11, 1991. The February 11, 1991 NSPS did not address Cd, Pb, Hg, or fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions,
but these pollutants are included in today's proposal. Also, today's proposal would apply to all MWC units at plants
with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day, whereas the February 11, 1991 NSPS only included MWC's with unit capacities
above 225 Mg/day. A comparison of the 1991 NSPS and the proposed NSPS emission limits for these pollutants is shown
in table 2.

<TEXT>
 


The MWC operating standards (GCP) contained in today's proposal are the same as those in the February 11, 1991 NSPS.
The training and certification requirements have changed somewhat. The February 11, 1991 standards require only
provisional certification of MWC chief facility operators and shift supervisors, but today's proposed standards
would require both provisional and then full certification. This change is being proposed because the full operator
certification program is now widely available. In 1991, the program was not widely available. 



Today's proposal also adds a provision to allow provisionally certified control room operators to stand in for the
MWC chief facility operators or shift supervisors in their temporary absence from the MWC. Additionally, today's
proposal would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators to complete
the EPA or a State MWC training course. This training course requirement was not included in the February 11, 1991 NSPS.





F. Performance Testing and Monitoring Requirements 





Information related to the performance testing and monitoring requirements for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC organics (dioxin/furan), PM, opacity, MWC operating practices, and NO

X

 has been published in a previous 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). These same requirements would be adopted by today's proposed NSPS and would
be extended to apply to all MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day. Because the proposed NSPS allows
compliance with a dioxin/furan limit either on a TEQ basis or on a total mass basis, procedures are being proposed for
determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. The mass of each tetra- through octa- chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin
and dibenzofuran congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method 23. Each congener mass would then be adjusted
by the corresponding toxic equivalency factor (TEF; the 1989 NATO international TEF's). Finally, the adjusted congener
masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in ng/dscm TEQ. Furthermore, today's proposal would
require both large and small MWC facilities to conduct annual opacity tests using EPA Reference Method 9. This testing
would be in addition to the continuous monitoring of opacity levels. Also, today's proposal allows small MWC facilities
to conduct less frequent testing for dioxin/furan, HCl, and PM emissions if the small facility consistently demonstrates
compliance. More specifically, if three consecutive annual compliance tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate
compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (i.e., dioxins/furans, PM, or HCl), the MWC would be allowed to
wait 3 years before retesting for the pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year shows compliance with
the emission limit for that pollutant, then the facility could again wait 3 years to test for the pollutant. If noncompliance
with the emission limit for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required to be undertaken and annual
testing would be required to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with the emission limit is established.
At a minimum, performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl would be required to be performed for each MWC unit
at small MWC plants every 3 years. All large MWC plants would continue to be required to conduct annual compliance tests.




Annual performance tests to determine compliance with the Cd, Pb, and Hg emission limits would be based on EPA Reference
Method 29. The average emission rates of three or more test runs using this methodology would be used to determine compliance.
The EPA considered the use of EPA Reference Method 101A for Hg testing; however, based on available data, the EPA has
concluded that Method 29 is a better measure of Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions than Method 101A and has therefore proposed
Method 29 for testing MWC's. 



Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate compliance with the Cd, Pb,
and Hg emission limits for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing for these three pollutants every
third year. 



The EPA Reference Method 29 is proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

. Method 29 is very similar to the method that has been used by the EPA's Office of Solid Waste to measure metals emissions
from boilers cofiring hazardous waste, commonly referred to as the EPA multimetals method. The proposed Method 29
is discussed in section IV.H of this preamble. 



Testing and monitoring requirements for NO

X

 at large MWC's are the same as those contained in the February 11, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488), and are based on use of a CEMS. 



Annual performance tests to determine compliance with the proposed fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions limits
would be based on EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous visual observation). The limits would apply at all times
and the tests would be conducted during periods of time when fly ash/bottom ash is transferred from the combustor or
from the air pollution control device to the ash loading area, and when ash is loaded for transportation or is being
transported onsite. 



The data availability requirement for CEMS (SO

2

, NO

X

, CO, and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) has been increased from the 1991 NSPS. Today's proposal would require that valid paired CEMS hourly averages (i.e.,
SO

2

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), NO

X

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), and CO and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the affected facility
is operated and combusting MSW. 


G. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 





The MWC NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 established reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC organics
(dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), operating practices (CO, load, flue gas temperature, and operator training/certification) and No

X

. These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are discussed in the February 11, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488). These same reporting and recordkeeping requirements would be adopted under the proposed NSPS,
with two exceptions. First, dioxins/furans would be recorded and reported on either a total mass basis or a TEQ basis.
Second, if small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl
every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for those years in which testing was not conducted.




Today's proposal also would add reporting and recordkeeping requirements for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed standards
would require that initial and annual compliance reports be submitted for Cd, Pb, and Hg for MWC's at plants with aggregate
capacities above 35 Mg/day. If small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct performance tests for Cd, Pb,
or Hg every third year, they would be allowed to submit a simplified annual report for those years when a full compliance
test was not required. The proposed NSPS would also require that the amount of activated carbon injected for Hg control
at small and large plants be recorded during MWC operation. 



Initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions testing would be required under today's
proposal for both small and large plants.

Additionally, today's proposal would require that the siting analysis, materials separation plan, and summary
of responses to public comments be submitted to the State. Refer to section V.D of this preamble for a discussion of
these proposed requirements.
Records of all data, including results of emission tests and compliance reports, would be maintained for 5 years following
the date of submission of the data.


III. Impacts of the Proposed Standards


The EPA projects that about 72 new MWC plants with a total MSW combustion capacity of about 17.6 million Mg/yr will begin
construction by the year 2000. Of those 72 plants, 48 are projected to be large plants and 24 are projected to be small
plants. The proposed subpart Eb NSPS would cover both the small and large plants, while the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS covers
only large plants. This section describes the impacts (i.e., air, water, solid waste, energy, control cost, and economic
impacts) of the proposed NSPS. The impacts of the proposed rule are provided in two forms. First, the incremental impacts
of the proposed NSPS over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS are presented. Second, the impacts of the proposed NSPS over a pre-1989
baseline (i.e., a baseline prior to the effective date of the subpart Ea NSPS) are presented. A summary of these impacts
is provided in table 3.

In addition, a summary of economic impacts (e.g., household, community, and business impacts) is presented that
provides projected economic burdens resulting from the combination of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart
Eb NSPS.
The cost estimates provided in this section are in 1990 dollars, and include costs for emission control and compliance
testing. The estimates do not include costs for such things as permitting and enforcement. For further information
on the impacts of the proposed NSPS, refer to the document entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for Proposed Emission
Standards and Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors'' that is included in the list of items under 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 at the beginning of this preamble.


A. Incremental Impacts of the Proposed NSPS over the 1991 NSPS


The following is a discussion of the incremental air, water and solid waste, energy, and cost impacts of the proposed
NSPS over the impacts of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.


1. Air Impacts


The air emission reductions discussed below, as well as other impacts discussed in today's proposal, are nationwide
impacts that would result from full implementation of the NSPS in the fifth year after adoption. These are incremental
impacts of the proposal over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.
Under today's proposed standards, nationwide emissions of total dioxins/furans would be reduced by about 1 kilogram
per year (kg/yr), total mass, over the reductions associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. Emissions of dioxins/furans
on a TEQ basis would reduced by about 10 grams per year (g/yr). On a nationwide basis, dioxin/furan emissions would
be reduced by about 33 percent over levels under the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.
Under the proposed NSPS, nationwide emissions of PM would be reduced by about 800 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) over the
levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. This represents a nationwide reduction of about 34 percent over the
subpart Ea levels.
Nationwide emissions of Cd and Pb would be reduced by about 1 and 17 Mg/yr, respectively, over the levels associated
with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. This represents an incremental reduction of about 53 percent for Cd and 81 percent for
Pb over subpart Ea NSPS levels.
Nationwide emissions of Hg would be reduced by about 18 Mg/yr over levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS.
This represents an incremental reduction of about 72 percent over subpart Ea NSPS levels.
Nationwide emissions of SO

2

 and HCl would be reduced by about 3,000 and 4,000 Mg/yr, respectively, over reductions associated with the 1991 subpart
Ea NSPS. Total acid gas emissions would be reduced by about 58 percent over subpart Ea NSPS levels.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Nationwide emissions of NO

X

 would be reduced by about 200 Mg/yr, or about 1 percent nationwide, over levels associated with the 1991 subpart Ea
NSPS. 


2. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 


The acid gas/PM and NO

X

 control technologies used as the basis for today's proposed NSPS are the same technologies used as a basis for the subpart
Ea NSPS. Those technologies were determined to have negligible water or solid waste impacts, as discussed in the previous


Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488). 
In the proposed NSPS, activated carbon injection is the technological basis for controlling Hg emissions. Activated
carbon injection does not produce a wastewater stream, and it would have a negligible solid waste impact. 
As with the 1991 NSPS, the EPA concludes that MWC ash disposal is adequately addressed by waste management standards
so that considerations of ash quality do not play a role in this rulemaking. 


3. Energy Impacts 


The energy impact of applying acid gas/PM controls to small plants and applying Hg controls to both small and large
MWC plants will result in a total national energy increase of about 27 gigawatt hours per year (GW-hr/yr) of electricity.
No increase in the use of natural gas is anticipated. 
Many of the small plants covered under today's proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale.
For example, a typical 100 Mg/day MWC plant would generate about 12 GW-hr/yr of electricity. Such an MWC would require
additional energy to operate pollution control equipment. The required energy would be about 0.7 GW-hr/yr of electricity,
which has a relatively small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 6 percent of energy generated). 



4. Control Cost Impacts 


The EPA estimates the incremental annual social cost of control of the proposed NSPS over the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS to
be about $43 million per year and the incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted to be about $1.95/Mg.
The incremental capital cost of control in the first 5 years of application is estimated to be $156 million over the
cost of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS. 


B. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS Over a Pre-1989 Baseline 


The following provides a discussion of the impacts of the proposed subpart Eb NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. Since
the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS has been effective for 3 years, the impacts presented below provide a useful account of the
total impact of the NSPS, based on both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart Eb standards. 


1. Air Impacts 


The air emission reductions discussed below are nationwide impacts that would result from full implementation of
the NSPS in the fifth year after adoption. These are not incremental impacts relative to the February 11, 1991 NSPS
(see section III.A for a description of incremental impacts). 
In combination, today's proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS would reduce nationwide emissions of dioxins/furans
by about 29 kg/yr, total mass. Emissions of dioxin/furans on a TEQ basis would be reduced by about 480 g/yr. This represents
an overall reduction of about 97 percent compared to baseline dioxins/furans emission levels in the absence of the
1991 and proposed NSPS. 
Under the proposed standards and the 1991 NSPS, nationwide emissions of PM would be reduced by about 6,500 Mg/yr. This
represents an overall control level of over 80 percent for PM emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence
of the 1991 and proposed NSPS. 
Nationwide emissions of Cd and Pb would be reduced by 10 and 157 Mg/yr, respectively. This represents an overall reduction
of about 94 percent for Cd emissions and about 98 percent for Pb emissions, compared to emission levels in the absence
of the 1991 and proposed NSPS. 
As a result of the 1991 and proposed NSPS, nationwide Hg emissions would be reduced by about 27 Mg/yr over baseline levels.
This represents an overall reduction of about 80 percent for Hg emissions compared to baseline levels in the absence
of the 1991 and proposed NSPS. 
Nationwide emissions of SO

2

 would be reduced by about 38,000 Mg/yr, and nationwide emissions of HCl would be reduced by about 50,000 Mg/yr. The
1991 and proposed NSPS would reduce MWC acid gas emissions by about 94 percent compared to baseline emission levels.

Nitrogen oxides emissions would be reduced by about 10,500 Mg/yr. This represents an overall nationwide 
reduction in NO

X

 emissions of about 35 percent as compared to levels in the absence of the 1991 and proposed NSPS. 


2. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 


As discussed in section III.A.2, the technologies used to comply with both the 1991 subpart Ea and proposed subpart
Eb NSPS do not produce a wastewater stream; therefore, no significant water pollution impacts are projected to occur.
Additionally, the application of these technologies would result in a negligible solid waste impact. 


3. Energy Impacts 


As a result of the proposed and 1991 standards, total national usage of energy is estimated to increase by about 290
GW-hr/yr of electricity above baseline. No increase in the usage of natural gas is anticipated. 
The majority of the MWC's covered under the proposal produce steam that is used to generate electricity for sale. Those
MWC's would require energy to operate pollution control equipment, but such energy requirements have a relatively
small impact on energy generated at the plant (about 4 to 6 percent of total energy generated).

4. Control Cost Impacts 


a. 

National Overview. 

The EPA estimates the total combined annual social cost of control of the 1991 NSPS and today's proposed standards
to be about $200 million per year, and the overall national average cost per unit of waste combusted would be about $13.50/Mg.
For perspective, typical costs incurred in 1990 by the general public for the collection, transportation, and combustion
of MSW and ash disposal ranged from $22/Mg to over $145/Mg of MSW, averaging about $90/Mg. Additionally, the EPA estimates
the capital cost of control in the first 5 years of application of the 1991 NSPS and today's proposal to be $769 million.

b. 

Control Costs for Typical MWC Plants. 

The previous section presented costs of the proposal on a national basis. This section presents examples of typical
costs that would be experienced at both a large MWC plant and a small MWC plant. These are typical costs. 
The costing data presented in this section are provided in the following formats: capital cost, annualized cost,
and cost per Mg of municipal waste combusted. The costing information is subcategorized by air pollution control
components (i.e., acid gas scrubber, activated carbon injection application, and NO

X

 control). For perspective, the estimated cost of combustion units (which includes the cost of GCP) is also displayed.
This costing information has been derived from 1989 background information documents that were used in developing
the 1991 NSPS (see 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

for more information about these documents), and is presented in 1987 dollars (the escalation factor for converting
to mid-1990 dollars is 1.111). 
From table 3A, it can be noted that the capital cost for control at a new large MWC plant (730 Mg/day capacity) would be
about $14.2 million of which $12.0 million would be for the acid gas control, 2.0 million for NO

X

 control, and less than one million for activated carbon injection. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about
$4.2 million/yr or about $17.50/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about $60/Mg
combusted to about $77/Mg combusted. Large MWC plants represent about 95 percent of MWC combustion capacity. 
For a new small MWC plant (90 Mg/day capacity), table 3A shows a capital cost for control of about $3.14 million of which
$3.1 million would be for the acid gas control system and the remaining for activated carbon injection. On an annualized
basis, the cost would be about $920,000/yr or about $31/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor
cost from about $60/Mg combusted to about $91/Mg combusted. Small MWC plants represent about 5 percent of MWC combustion
capacity. 


C. Economic Impacts 


The following provides a discussion of the total economic impacts (e.g., household, community, and business impacts)
of the proposed and 1991 NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. As discussed in sections III.A.4 and III.B.4 of 
this preamble, the proposed subpart Eb standards would have a small incremental national average cost per unit of
waste combusted ($1.95/Mg) as compared to the combined impact of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart
Eb NSPS ($13.50/Mg). Since the proposed NSPS is based on the same technologies as the 1991 NSPS, and since the 1991 NSPS
has been effective for 3 years, the impacts presented below provide a useful account of the total economic impacts
of the NSPS, based on both the 1991 and proposed NSPS. In estimating the economic impacts, the EPA assumed that all new
MWC's would have been built with no more emission control than that mandated by regulations promulgated before 1991,
specifically, 40 CFR part 60, subparts E and Db. This pre-1991 situation represents the baseline for estimating regulatory
costs; therefore, all cost estimates provided are the full costs above this baseline.

The overall incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted of $13.50/Mg (presented in section III.B.4
of this preamble) breaks down as follows: $11 for acid gas/PM and metals control; $0.40 for Hg control; $1.80 for NO

X

 control; and $0.35 for testing, reporting, and recordkeeping. The $1.80 cost for NO

X

 control is for large MWC plants only, because no small plants will incur NO

X

 control costs. 
The standard will have a wide range of impacts on the price of combustion services. To study these potential impacts,
the EPA first applied a cost accounting procedure that approximates the one that would be used by an individual publicly
owned MWC. Then, using a 1993 average tipping fee of $57/Mg of MSW combusted (1990 dollars) and assuming the full cost
of meeting acid gas, PM, Hg, and NO

X

 requirements is passed directly to MWC customers, the EPA found that the lowest and highest tipping fee increases
for the model plants used in the EPA's economic analysis would be about $11/Mg and $85/Mg, respectively. The majority
of tipping fee increases would be in the $13/Mg to $18/Mg 
range. This increase would be equivalent to about $1.00/month to $1.50/month for a typical household. 
The EPA projects that, regardless of how the regulatory costs are financed, most of the burden will find its way directly
or indirectly to households served by MWC's. Costs that are directly assessed to households are likely to be in the
form of increased collection fees and/or increased taxes. Indirect household costs are price increases charged
by businesses that similarly are faced with increases in collection fees and/or taxes. For the 1991 NSPS and the standards
being proposed today, the EPA projects an increase in the average annual household cost of waste disposal of about
$21 for communities that construct new MWC's. The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions, including
the extent to which recycling and landfilling are also used within the affected community. Approximately 54 percent
of the total average household cost is a direct cost, thus the annual direct household cost would be a little over $11.
The EPA estimates that the average annual household cost breaks down to $17 per year for communities over 250,000 in
population, $23 for communities with populations between 100,000 and 250,000, $29 for communities with populations
between 50,000 and 100,000, and $27 for communities with populations under 50,000. This range represents 0.04 to
0.09 percent of household income. The EPA expects that comparatively few communities under 100,000 will be affected
by the standards, because such communities tend to rely on landfilling. 
The adoption of new regulations increases costs for a community and at some point has the potential to affect abilities
to issue bonds. To address this issue, the EPA used demographic and financial data to project potential difficulty
that might confront communities planning to construct new MWC's with bond financing. Applying generally accepted
criteria for issuance of revenue and general obligation bonds, the EPA found that no community, large or small, should
experience difficulty with bond financing as a result of the proposed standards. 
To address the issue of cost increases, the EPA identified five private firms that plan to construct one or more MWC's
that will be subject to the standards. Of the five, four are small (i.e., have less than $6 million in annual sales).
(Firms for which annual sales data are not available are assumed to be small.) Financial data are available for only
one firm, which is a large firm. Total annual costs of the 1991 and proposed NSPS as a percentage of sales is less than
1 percent for that firm. Potential tipping fee increases, based on the full pass-through of emission control costs
(i.e., passing all control costs to consumers via the tipping fee) and an average tipping fee of $57/Mg (1990 dollars),
will average about 28 percent for MWC's owned by small firms, and about 17 percent for MWC's owned by large firms.

In its analysis of cost, economic, and environmental impacts, the EPA assumed that the 1991 NSPS and the standards
being proposed today will not cause communities to alter their plans to construct new (or to use already constructed)
MWC plants. Specifically, the EPA is assuming that its projections of how much MSW will be combusted in the year 2000,
and the types and sizes of new combustors that will be used, will not be effected by the standards being proposed today.
However, some communities, if faced with large compliance costs, may choose to delay or cancel construction, or to
downsize MWC's, or to change combustion technology. These communities probably would expand landfilling, recycling,
or source-reduction activities. If the standards do cause some communities to shift away from combustion, the result
will be a general reduction of the cost impacts reported here. However, any such shifts caused by the standards, and
the net economic and environmental effects of those shifts, are extremely difficult to project. This is in part due
to the fact that environmental regulations for landfills, as well as landfill site location problems, will be exerting
an opposite influence on communities_causing them to look with more favor on combustion alternatives. 
The EPA has been able to quantify some of the benefits of the standards. The absence of sufficient exposure-response
and valuation information precludes a comprehensive benefits analysis for many of the MWC pollutants. The EPA expects
partial benefits for reduction of PM and SO

2

_primarily benefits from reductions in morbidity and mortality_to total about $160 million annually. However,
recent evidence suggests the mortality reduction benefits of particulate matter controls may be higher than is assumed
in this analysis. 
In conclusion, based on the combined economic impacts analysis of both the 1991 and proposed NSPS, the EPA expects
that no community will be significantly impacted by the proposed and 1991 NSPS. Since the incremental impact of the
proposal over the 1991 NSPS is only one-seventh the total combined impact (based on incremental national average
cost per unit of waste combusted), the proposal is expected to have a very small impact on communities. 


IV. Rationale for Proposed Standards for MWC Emissions 


This section addresses the legal, technical, and economic basis for the proposed NSPS. The basis for regulating MWC's,
for regulating the specified pollutants, and for regulating MWC's according to the specified size categories are
discussed. The section also presents the EPA's approach in establishing the MACT floor and selecting MACT. Additionally,
the section discusses the selected format for the proposed standards, the proposed performance testing and monitoring
requirements, and the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

A. Background 


On November 15, 1990, the Act was amended. The amendments added a new section 129 to the Act, which applies to a range
of solid waste incinerators including MWC's, medical waste incinerators (MWI's), 
infectious waste incinerators, and industrial waste incinerators. 
Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA was directed to develop and promulgate MACT-based
NSPS for MWC's according to a specified schedule. At the time of enactment of the Act as amended in 1990, the EPA had already
proposed, under section 111 of the Act, NSPS based on BDT for all sizes of new MWC's. Section 129 of the Act of 1990 directed
the EPA to promulgate standards based on BDT under the deadlines imposed in the consent decree in 

State of New York et al. 

versus 

Reilly

 (No. 89-1729 D.D.C.), but limited applicability of the standards to combustors with unit capacities greater
than 225 Mg/day. As a result, the standards, which were proposed in 1989, under development for promulgation in late
1990 were revised to be applicable only to these MWC units. The final standards were signed by the Administrator on
January 11, 1991 published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488). 
Section 129 of the Act also directs the EPA to develop another NSPS for MWC's that would be based on a more stringent control
scenario, apply to smaller facilities, and cover more pollutants. Specifically, section 129 directs the EPA to promulgate
MACT-based NSPS for MWC units at MWC plants with capacities to combust less than 225 Mg/day. Section 129 also directs
the EPA to develop numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, and Hg, to incorporate siting requirements for new units,
and to develop operator training requirements. Additionally, section 129 directs the EPA to develop an opacity limit
for air curtain incinerators firing certain ``clean'' fuels. 
Today's proposal complies with all requirements of section 129 described above. This has been done by: (1) Proposing
MACT-based NSPS that cover MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day; (2) proposing numerical emission
limits for Cd, Pb, and Hg; (3) proposing siting requirements for new MWC units; (4) proposing operator training requirements;
and (5) proposing opacity limits for air curtain incinerators firing specific ``clean'' fuels. 
The proposed NSPS are, in effect, replacing the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS for MWC facilities for which construction,
modification, or reconstruction begins after September 20, 1994, because the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS are
based on BDT rather than MACT. The February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect for facilities for which construction,
modification or reconstruction began after December 20, 1989 but on or before September 20, 1994. Those existing
facilities constructed after December 20, 1989 but before this proposal would be subject to both the 1991 subpart
Ea NSPS and the subpart Cb guidelines proposed in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. This dual coverage under both the proposed subpart Cb and the 1991 subpart Ea is further discussed in the preamble
to the proposed subpart Cb in today's 

Federal Register

 notice. 


B. Selection of Source Category 


The previous MWC NSPS adopted on February 11, 1991 provided the rationale for the selection of MWC's as a source category
to be regulated (56 FR 5488). Moreover, section 129 of the Act directs the EPA to issue NSPS for this source category,
and thereby confirms the EPA's earlier decision. 
Today's proposed NSPS (subpart Eb) would apply to new MWC's, defined as those MWC's for which construction, modification,
or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994. Municipal waste combustors for which construction, modification,
or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994, would be covered by the subpart Cb emission guidelines
proposed in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. 
Also, as required by section 129 of the Act, today's proposed NSPS would establish opacity limits for certain new air
curtain incinerators, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20,
1994. Under the proposed NSPS, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, and clean untreated
lumber would be required to meet an opacity limit and no other requirements would apply. The proposed standards for
these air curtain incinerators are presented in section VII of this preamble. 


C. Modification or Reconstruction of Existing MWC's 


The subpart Ea NSPS proposal published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided a discussion of the terms and conditions associated with construction,
modification, and reconstruction for MWC's. One change is being proposed. Previously, the terms ``modification''
and ``reconstruction'' were defined under sections 60.14 and 60.15 of subpart A of part 60. Section 129 of the Act has
specified a new definition of ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' that combines and revises the previous
definitions of ``modification'' and ``reconstruction.'' Specifically, ``modified solid waste incineration
unit'' refers to: 
(1) Modifications for which the 



* * * cumulative costs of the modifications, over the life of the unit, exceed 50 per centum of the original cost of the
construction and installation of the unit (not including the cost of any land purchased in connection with such construction
or installation) updated to current costs * * *.



or (2) modifications involving

 

* * * a physical change in or change in the method of operation of the unit which increases the amount
of any air pollutant emitted by the unit for which standards have been established under [section 129] or section 111
* * *.

D. Selection of Designated Pollutants 


The previous MWC NSPS proposal published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided the rationale for the selection of ``MWC emissions'' and NO

X

 as designated pollutants under section 111(b) of the Act. Additionally, section 129 of the Act specifies that emission
limits shall be developed for PM, opacity, SO

2

, HCl, NO

X

, CO, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans. Emission limits for all but three of these pollutants (Cd, Pb, and Hg) were established
in the February 11, 1991 standards. Section 129 also requires that siting requirements be established for new MWC's
that will minimize, on a site-specific basis, potential risks to public health or the environment. Today's proposal
responds to these new 1990 Act requirements. 
Standards for fugitive MWC fly ash/bottom ash emissions are proposed today because these emissions contain PM, Cd,
Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans, which are components of the designated pollutant ``MWC emissions.'' 


E. Selection of Affected Facilities 


For the proposed NSPS, the affected facility, an MWC facility, is defined as any setting or equipment chamber or pit
used to burn MSW (including RDF) and extends to MWC fly ash/bottom ash emission points, including ash storage areas,
conveyor transfer points, and ash loading areas for hauling trucks at the MWC site. This does not extend to ash handling
outside of the MWC property boundary or at ash fill sites. 
Municipal waste combustion includes the burning (or pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of equipment, chamber, or pit, including
equipment with and without heat recovery. Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream
of household, commercial, and/or institutional discards. This would include discards such as paper, wood, yard
wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber, glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials.
The MSW definition includes household discards as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but
does not include segregated industrial process/manufacturing discards or medical waste. The MSW definition also
includes RDF, which is a type of MSW that is shredded (or pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. However,
any mixtures of medical waste with nonmedical hospital waste or with household, commercial, or institutional waste
is considered to be MSW. 
Any mixtures or industrial process/manufacturing discards with nonprocess industrial waste or with household,
commercial, or institutional waste is considered to be MSW. Minor editing has been made in the definition of MSW to
clarify this point. 
Cofired combustors are those that fire MSW with non-MSW fuel such as coal. Cofired combustors that combust a fuel feed
stream comprised, in aggregate, of equal to or less than 30 percent MSW or RDF (by weight, based on a 24-hour average)
would not be subject to the NSPS and would be required only to submit an initial notification of construction and subsequent
reports of the amount of MSW and other fuels combusted. The exclusion of cofired combustors from the NSPS is consistent
with section 129 of the 1990 Act. This exclusion is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS. 
Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW are subject to the proposal;
however, air curtain incinerators that combust only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber (these
are a subset of MSW) would be subject to an opacity standard and its associated testing, recordkeeping, and reporting,
which are included in today's proposal, but would not be subject to any other parts of today's proposal. This exclusion
does not apply to air curtain incinerators that combust other MSW materials. 
Additionally, waste-fuel power generation facilities that combust a single-item waste stream of tires, fuel derived
solely from tires, or used oil would be subject only to an initial notification of construction and would not be subject
to any other provisions in today's proposal. This exclusion is unchanged from the NSPS promulgated on February 11,
1991. 
The NSPS for MWC's proposed today would apply to MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. The lower size
threshold of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity for controlling MWC emissions under the proposed NSPS was selected
after reviewing the population distributions of MWI's and MWC's. Most incinerators at medical waste facilities
are smaller incinerators that fire segregated medical waste with general hospital discards (MSW), and these incinerators
would have the potential to be covered by today's proposal. The population distribution of MWI's is distinctly different
from the population distribution of traditional MWC plants that are the target of today's proposal. The existing
distribution of MWC's is composed of about 179 plants, with an average plant size of about 600 Mg/day combustion capacity,
with two or three MWC units per plant. Assuming continuous operation, the potential nationwide combustion capacity
of existing MWC's is about 107,000 Mg/day. The MWI distribution is quite different and includes about 7,000 combustors
with a single combustion unit per facility and an average unit size of less than 3 Mg/day combustion capacity. The total
U.S. capacity of MWI's is about 20,000 Mg/day. This population is being addressed under a separate rulemaking. These
population distributions of existing MWC's and MWI's are for existing units but are considered representative of
new unit applications. Clearly, the MWC population represents a smaller number of comparatively larger combustors,
and MWI's represent a much larger number of smaller combustors. The lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant
capacity that is included in today's proposal would exclude less than 1 percent of the total nationwide combustion
capacity of MWC's and would result in over 99 percent of total MWC capacity being covered by the standards. The same
lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day would prevent significant dual coverage under the proposal by excluding more than 99
percent of MWI units and about 97 percent of nationwide MWI capacity from today's proposed revisions. 
The proposed standards would therefore cover the great majority of MWC's, but cover only a few of the largest regional
MWI's (nine units at three sites are known to cofire medical waste with MSW and are above the 35 Mg/day total plant capacity
cutoff). The Act of 1990 requires that regulations for MWI's be developed separately. For these reasons, it is appropriate
that today's proposed standards focus on MWC's and that a separate regulation focus on MWI's. The NSPS and emission
guidelines for MWI's are scheduled to be proposed in 1995.

<TEXT>
 

Those MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities below 35 Mg/day would not be subject to the emission limits or any other
emission control requirements under today's proposal. However, MWC plants with aggregate capacities greater than
25 Mg/day and less than or equal to 35 Mg/day would be required to provide a one-time notification of construction,
which would include their location, planned startup date, the types of fuels that will be combusted, and aggregate
plant capacity and supporting information including calculations used to determine plant capacity. This one-time
report would allow the EPA or State agency to enforce the lower size cutoff for applicability to the proposed standards.
Plants with aggregate capacities of 25 Mg/day or below would not be subject to any provisions under this proposal.

The proposed standards for MWC's are subdivided into two subcategories of air emissions requirements: The first
for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust more than 35 Mg/day but less than or equal to 225
Mg/day of MSW (referred to as small MWC plants), and the second for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities
to combust greater than 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as large MWC plants). The 225 Mg/day dividing point was established
because the population of plants with aggregate capacities equal to or below 225 Mg/day contains many modular MWC's,
and there are concerns about how applicable technologies such as selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) are to
modular MWC's. 
The EPA projects that the population of new MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities above 225 Mg/day will account
for about 93 percent of new combustion capacity, whereas the population of MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities
greater than 35 Mg/day but equal to or less than 225 Mg/day will account for about 7 percent of new combustion capacity.



F. Selection of Maximum Achievable Control Technology 


The following discussion addresses the EPA's selection of MACT. The existing technologies for controlling emissions
of the designated pollutants from MWC's are first reviewed, followed by a summary of the EPA's approach for establishing
the MACT floor. Finally, the discussion presents the EPA's selection of MACT for MWC's. 


1. Summary of MWC Control Technologies 


The following discussion reviews the existing technologies for controlling emissions of acid gases, dioxins/furans,
PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

X

 from MWC's. 
a.

 Acid Gas/PM Control Technologies.

 Municipal waste combustor acid gas/PM control is a general term that refers to a group of MWC air pollution control
technology combinations. These combinations control a wide range of pollutants, such as MWC acid gases (including
SO

2

 and HCl), MWC organics (including dioxins/furans), and PM and metals (including Cd, Pb, and a number of other metals
except Hg). The two acid gas/PM controls most commonly used in the United States for new MWC's are: (1) GCP plus dry sorbent
injection (DSI) followed by a fabric filter (FF); and (2) GCP plus a spray dryer (SD) followed by an FF. Discussions
of these two acid gas/PM control systems were presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the 1991 acid
gas and PM NSPS in subpart Ea (54 FR 52251). Control of Cd, Pb, and Hg were not discussed in detail in the 1989 preamble.

Since 1991, the performance of the acid gas/PM control systems for removal of Cd, Pb, and Hg has been investigated in
more depth. Cadmium and Pb are volatile at temperatures present in combustion systems, but condense onto PM at temperatures
associated with the operation of most PM control systems. As a result, the control of Cd and Pb is generally related
to the control of PM emissions. However, because of the potential for adsorption of these metals onto fine PM that is
less readily collected than larger PM, the control efficiency for these metals may be lower than that for total PM.

Fabric filter-equipped systems (e.g., DSI/FF's and SD/FF's) generally have better Cd and Pb control because these
devices are better able to collect fine PM than electrostatic precipitator (ESP)-equipped systems. For DSI/FF and
SD/FF systems, data for controlled Cd emissions range from 0.001 to 0.010 mg/dscm. Emissions of Pb from MWC's with
these systems range up to 0.10 mg/dscm, but the majority are generally less than 0.050 mg/dscm.

<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although the above technologies are effective at removing Cd, Pb, and other metals, they do not consistently remove
Hg without integrating some other form of Hg control. A discussion of Hg control is presented below.

b. 

Mercury Control Technologies. 

The EPA estimates that typical uncontrolled Hg emission levels from MWC's in the United States range from 0.20 to 1.4
mg/dscm at 7 percent O

2

. Unlike other metals, Hg has a high vapor pressure at typical operating temperatures of air pollution control devices;
therefore, collection of Hg by the PM control device is highly variable. The EPA collected test data from more than
30 MWC's with various air pollution control device systems that indicate a wide range of Hg control. High-efficiency
PM control, lower flue gas temperatures in the air pollution control system, and a sufficient level of carbon in the
fly ash facilitate Hg control. Higher levels of carbon in the fly ash and reduced flue gas temperatures enhance Hg adsorption
onto the carbon, which can then be removed by the PM control device. To promote Hg adsorption, it is important to operate
the control systems at temperatures less than about 150 to 200 
 C. Low flue gas temperature is inherent to acid gas control.

Municipal waste combustors with high combustion efficiency will have effective carbon burnout and, therefore,
will have low fly ash carbon content. These units may achieve little or no Hg control even when equipped with acid gas/PM
control systems, and the control may be highly variable even at the same site.

Three techniques of Hg control are currently being used: Activated carbon injection, sodium sulfide (Na

2

S) injection, and wet scrubbing. Activated carbon injection and Na

2

S injection are used in conjunction with an acid gas control device. Brief discussions of these three Hg control technologies
and their capabilities are presented below.

Injection of powdered activated carbon into the flue gas prior to the acid gas/PM control device has been tested at
U.S. MWC's. The removal mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed that activated carbon is a catalyst for
the oxidation of elemental Hg to mercuric oxide and mercuric chloride, which can more readily be captured in the air
pollution control device. This technology has been applied commercially to MWC's in Europe equipped with SD/ESP's
and during test programs in Europe and Canada to MWC's with SD/FF's and DSI/FF's. The EPA also recently tested activated
carbon injection at the Stanislaus County MWC in California and the Camden County MWC in New Jersey. The Stanislaus
County MWC is equipped with an SD/FF, and the Camden County MWC is equipped with an SD/ESP. Test results show Hg reductions
greater than 85 percent when injecting activated carbon.

Another Hg control technology that has been applied to MWC's is Na

2

S injection. Sodium sulfide is a crystalline solid that dissolves in water. The resulting Na

2

S solution is sprayed into the flue gas prior to the acid gas/PM control device. The reaction of Na

2

S and Hg precipitates solid mercuric sulfide (HgS) that is collected in the PM control device.

Three MWC's in Sweden, two in Germany, and one in Canada have used Na

2

S injection to control Hg emissions. All of these facilities use DSI/FF systems for acid gas/PM control, and injection
of Na

2

S occurs prior to the DSI/FF system at flue gas temperatures of 130 to 250 
 C. In addition, Hg emission tests were conducted at the Stanislaus County MWC in California while using Na

2

S injection. Results from tests at European, Canadian, and U.S. MWC's have shown Hg removal efficiencies of 40 to 90
percent when using Na

2

S injection.

Wet scrubbing is a form of acid gas control that also controls Hg without use of an add-on Hg control system. This technology
has primarily been used on MWC's in Europe and Japan. Typically, the flue gas is first directed through an ESP to reduce
PM, followed by wet scrubbing, which involves passing the flue gas through a one- or two-stage absorber system where
the gas stream is saturated with an alkaline solution. During this process, flue gas temperatures are reduced to as
low as 55 
 C. The low absorber operating temperature promotes Hg condensation, resulting in an Hg reduction of greater
than 80 percent. The alkaline solution used in the wet scrubbing process, typically containing calcium hydroxide
(Ca(OH)

2

), reacts with the acid gas to form salts, which are generally insoluble and may be removed by sequential clarifying,
thickening, and vacuum filtering. The dewatered salts or sludges are then sent to a landfill. The disadvantages of
wet scrubbing include the quantity of water required, potential difficulties with waste handling, and undefined
performance at U.S. MWC units firing U.S. MSW streams.

Nitrogen Oxides Control Technologies.

 During combustion, NO

X

 are formed through oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen (N

2

) contained in MSW, and fixation and oxidation of atmospheric N

2

. Emissions of NO

X

 can be controlled using SNCR add-on control technology that reduces NO

X

 to N

2

 without the use of catalysts. Techniques include Thermal DeNO

X

TM

, which injects ammonia into the combustor as a reducing agent; the NO

X

OUT

TM

 process, which injects urea with chemical additives; and a two-stage urea/methanol injection process. A discussion
of SNCR NO

X

 control was presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the 1991 NSPS for new MWC's (54 FR 52251). The use
of SNCR at MWC's results in NO

X

 emission reductions of about 45 percent.

There are some concerns about the applicability of SNCR to modular MWC's. The SNCR technology has never been applied
to modular MWC's, and several factors may complicate the use of SNCR and may reduce its performance level. First, many
modular units are batch fed in cycles of about 6 to 12 minutes per charge (due to small combustor size), which may cause
frequent temperature fluctuations. When the temperature fluctuates above the required injection temperature
window, the reducing reagent is oxidized to NO

X

, and NO

X

 emissions can increase. When the temperature drops below the required range, unreacted ammonia (NH

3

) emissions can occur. In addition, the varying moisture and nonhomogeneous nature of the waste burned can also result
in temperature fluctuations in a small unit. With certain modifications, it may be possible to accommodate SNCR at
new modular units; however, the NO

X

 reduction performance of an SNCR system on a modular unit will probably be lower than that for a combustor with more
stable operating temperatures, as occurs at large MWC's.

The EPA requests comment on the applicability of SNCR and other NO

X

 control techniques to MWC's at small plants. The EPA requests that comments address the cost, technical performance,
and reliability of application of SNCR or other NO

X

 control techniques specifically to modular starved-air MWC's and modular excess-air MWC's. Based on the comments
and information received, the EPA will reconsider requiring NO

X

 control on MWC's at small plants.

The amount of NO

X

 formed varies by combustor type. Three types of MWC's, mass burn/rotary combustors, fluidized-bed combustors,
and modular/excess-air combustors, are considered ``low NO

X

'' combustors. Available data show that these types of MWC's consistently show NO

X

 levels below 150 ppmv without the use of SNCR.



2. MACT Floor and MACT Requirements of the Act



The NSPS promulgated under subpart Ea on February 11, 1991 is based on BDT. Section 129 requires that the NSPS promulgated
under subpart Ea be reviewed and revised based on MACT. Congress established a minimum floor for the standards. For
new sources, the standard may be no less stringent than ``the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best
controlled similar unit.'' This is often referred to as the ``MACT floor'' for new sources.

To establish the emission control level achieved by the best controlled similar unit, the EPA reviewed available
MWC emissions test data associated with all types of combustors and all types of emission control technologies that
are currently being used to control emissions of SO

2

, HCl, PM, Pb, Cd, Hg, dioxins/furans, and NO

X

. The EPA identified the best controlled unit and reviewed the performance of its associated control technology.
The EPA has concluded that the control technology used by the best controlled unit is applicable to all types of combustors
(with one exception, as noted below) and achieves the same level of performance on all combustor types. Thus, there
is no need to subcategorize performance to different classes of similar MWC units. The EPA determined that the best
controlled MWC (i.e., the basis for the MACT floor) would be an MWC equipped with an SD/FF and SNCR (large MWC plants
only). Based on test data from MWC's equipped with SD/FF and SNCR (large plants only) control systems, the EPA established
the MACT floor as the emission control level for each pollutant achieved in practice by the best controlled MWC unit.

The MACT floor defines the minimum level of emission control that may be considered to be MACT, regardless of cost or
other considerations. However, in requiring control beyond the MACT floor when determining MACT, the EPA must determine
the maximum emission reduction achievable for new MWC units taking into consideration the cost of achieving such
emission reduction and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. Therefore,
the level of control that represents MACT may be more stringent than the MACT floor. The following section presents
the EPA's rationale for establishing the MACT floor and MACT for MWC's.



3. MACT Floor and MACT



This section summarizes the MACT floor and presents the EPA's rationale for establishing MACT for each pollutant
for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants.

In establishing the MACT floor and MACT for each pollutant for small and large plants, the EPA used principally the
data base created for establishing the NSPS for MWC's proposed in 1989 and promulgated in 1991 under subpart Ea. For
a few pollutants in this proposal, the EPA utilized more recent test data to supplement the 1989 data base. Because
most of the test data used for this proposal are more than 4 years old, and in consideration of the fact that most MWC's
retest at least once per year, the EPA requests submittal of the most recent MWC emissions test data.

Additionally, the EPA requests comment on which MWC emissions test data would be the most appropriate basis for judging
the performance of SD/FF's in establishing the MACT floor and MACT for new MWC's. For example, should the EPA consider
test data for only the most recently-built MWC's (e.g., units that have begun operation since 1990), or should consideration
be made of all operational MWC's, independent of unit age? Also, if the EPA has multiple emission tests for a given MWC
over its operating history (which is common), should the EPA utilize the data from all of the emission tests performed
for the unit or from only the most recent emission test, in determining the performance of the unit? The EPA also requests
comment on suggestions of analytical methods to use for analysis of the data (e.g., analytical methods that could
be used to address emissions variability, including methods for analyzing variable data collected over multiple
years for one MWC and methods of adjusting the emissions data to account for variability). The appropriate treatment
of variability will be related to the format chosen for the standards (see discussion of alternative formats below).

Based on the new data submitted and on the final choice of which test data and what analytical methods to use, the EPA
may promulgate final emission limits that are more or less stringent than those proposed today.

a. 

Summary of the MACT floor. 

This proposal determines the MACT floor for new units based on performance of the best control technology. Under the
proposal, emission control level achieved in practice by an MWC equipped with the best emission control technology
(i.e., an SD/FF and SNCR (large MWC plants only)) represents the MACT floor for each pollutant (see table 4).

The MACT floor for new sources (best control) could be constructed in a number of different ways including a technology
basis (this proposal), a permit basis, or an emission data basis. For example, under the permit basis the most stringent
MWC operating permit limitation might determine the floor. Other approaches are also possible. The different approaches
would result in noticeably different MACT floor performance levels. The EPA specifically requests comment on what
approach is most appropriate and the rationale for that approach. Based on the EPA's review of comments received on
this issue, as well as reanalysis of the data submitted, the MACT floor for the promulgated NSPS may be noticeably higher
or lower than the floor included in the proposal. 

b. 

MACT for Sulfur Dioxide.

 Uncontrolled SO

2

 emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 160 ppmv. The best emission control system for controlling
SO

2

 emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with SD/FF systems indicates that an SO

2

 emission level of either 30 ppmv or an 80-percent reduction of SO

2

 emissions can be continuously achieved over a 24-hour block averaging period. Therefore, the MACT floor for SO

2

 emissions is either 30 ppmv or 80-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. The proposed MACT standard for
SO

2

 for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 30 ppmv or 80-percent reduction, whichever is
less stringent. 

c. 

MACT for Hydrogen Chloride.

 Uncontrolled HCl emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 500 ppmv. The best emission control
system for controlling HCl emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with SD/FF systems
indicates that an HCl emission level of either 25 ppmv or a 95-percent reduction in HCl emissions can be achieved. Compliance
with the HCl limit is determined by an annual stack test rather than CEMS, so there is no CEMS data averaging period associated
with this level of performance. Based on the EPA's analysis, the MACT floor for HCl emissions is either 25 ppmv or 95-percent
reduction, whichever is less stringent. The proposed MACT standard for HCl for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants
is the MACT floor level of either 25 ppmv or 95-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. 

d. 

MACT for Particulate Matter.

 Uncontrolled PM emission levels at small and large MWC plants are, on average, 1,500 and 3,700 mg/dscm, respectively.
The best emission control system for controlling PM emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of recent test data has
shown that SD/FF systems can continuously achieve a PM emission level of 15 mg/dscm, which represents greater than
99-percent reduction. Therefore, the MACT floor for PM emissions is 15 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT standard for PM
for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 15 mg/dscm.

e. 

MACT for Cadmium.

 Uncontrolled Cd emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 1.2 mg/dscm. The best emission
control system for controlling Cd emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with SD/FF
systems indicates that these systems can continuously achieve a Cd emission level of 0.010 mg/dscm, which represents
greater than 99-percent reduction. Therefore, the MACT floor for Cd emissions is 0.010 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT
standard for Cd for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 0.010 mg/dscm. 

f. 

MACT for Lead.

 Uncontrolled Pb emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 25 mg/dscm. The best emission control
system for controlling Pb emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with modern SD/FF
systems indicates that these systems can continuously achieve a Pb emission level of 0.10 mg/dscm, which represents
greater than 99-percent reduction. Therefore, the MACT floor for Pb emissions is 0.10 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT
standard for Pb for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 0.10 mg/dscm. 

g. 

MACT for Mercury.

 Uncontrolled Hg emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 0.65 mg/dscm. The MACT floor is
based on using an SD/FF. Control of Hg is highly variable, and the EPA's analysis of recent test data has indicated that
the control efficiency of SD/FF systems for Hg ranges from no control to 50-percent Hg reduction (i.e., achieving
Hg emission levels of 0.33 to 0.65 mg/dscm). Therefore, the MACT floor for Hg is 0.65 mg/dscm. 

As discussed in section IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that Hg control is based on three variables:
Lower flue gas temperatures in the air pollution control system, high-efficiency PM control (e.g., based on use of
an FF or ESP), and a sufficient level of carbon in the fly ash (i.e., based on use of activated carbon injection). Recent
testing programs at the MWC plants in Stanislaus County, California, and Camden County, New Jersey, have demonstrated
that the combination of an SD/FF or SD/ESP system, activated carbon injection, and low flue gas temperature at the
PM control device inlet can achieve high Hg control efficiency. The EPA's analysis of this test data has indicated
that MWC's equipped with this combination of control technologies could continuously achieve an Hg emission level
of either less than 0.080 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O

2

, or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Data from individual test runs show occasional spikes of high inlet Hg
emissions due to the variability in the waste feed composition. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated,
a 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable; however, activated carbon injection could achieve an 85-percent
reduction during such episodes. Based on the data from MWC's using activated carbon injection, Hg control to these
levels is achievable by properly operated systems on all types of MWC's. Since activated carbon injection is a relatively
new technology and has not yet been applied commercially, the 0.080 mg/dscm or 85-percent reduction Hg emission level
is not part of the MACT floor. The EPA estimates the cost to add carbon injection to be reasonable, at a cost effectiveness
of $1.00/Mg of MSW combusted. Therefore, the EPA is proposing MACT for Hg for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants
to be more stringent than the MACT floor, at a level of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions, whichever
is least stringent. 

The EPA has selected activated carbon injection as the basis for achieving MACT for Hg, although facilities may use
any technology capable of meeting the proposed standard. Of the three Hg control technologies discussed in section
IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that the performance of activated carbon injection is the best demonstrated
of the three Hg control technologies in the United States. 

h. 

MACT for Dioxins/Furans.

 Uncontrolled dioxin/furan emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 1,000 ng/dscm, total
mass. The best emission control system for controlling dioxin/furan emissions is an SD/FF system and GCP. The EPA's
analysis of available test data for dioxin/furan emissions from new MWC's with SD/FF systems and GCP indicates that
dioxin/furan emission levels of less than 20 ng/dscm total mass are continuously achievable. Therefore, the MACT
floor for dioxins/furans is 20 ng/dscm, which represents a 98-percent reduction.

The EPA has determined that additional dioxin/furan control is achievable with activated carbon injection, which
is the basis for MACT for Hg, as discussed above. The EPA's analysis of test data from a recent testing program at an MWC
at the Camden County, New Jersey, facility and other facilities indicates that the injection of activated carbon
into the flue gas of an SD-based scrubbing system provides additional removal of dioxins/furans (greater than 50
percent additional control over levels achieved with SD/ESP systems alone). As such, the EPA believes a dioxin/furan
level of approximately 10 ng/dscm total mass (which represents a 99-percent reduction) is achievable for MWC's using
GCP and equipped with SD/FF's and activated carbon injection. Because carbon injection is being proposed as part
of the basis for MACT for Hg, the EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants
based on carbon injection. The EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ basis and a total mass basis. Based
on the EPA's analysis of an average TEQ ratio, the 10 ng/dscm total mass emission level translates to 0.16 TEQ. However,
because there is uncertainty about the ratio, the proposed MACT floor for dioxins/furans on a TEQ basis is 0.20 ng/dscm.
Using the average TEQ ratio, 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ is equivalent to about 13 ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans. Therefore,
the EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants at a level of 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ
or 13 ng/dscm total mass. Sources may comply with either format of the limit. 

However, since the activated carbon injection technology does not have a long-term record of commercial application
in the United States and since the 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass standard is restrictive, the EPA is proposing
a 3-year optimization schedule for activated carbon injection applied at initial subpart Eb applications. All affected
facilities commencing construction after September 20, 1994, but on or before September 22, 1997 would be required
to meet a standard of 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total mass for the first 3 years following the date of initial startup.
Thereafter, the standard would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass. For all affected facilities commencing
construction after September 22, 1997, the standard at startup would be 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total mass.
Starting in 1994, MWC units with activated carbon injection technology will be initiating commercial operation.
As dioxin/furan data become available from MWC's operating with carbon injection technology, the EPA will reconsider
the appropriateness of the 3-year optimization schedule. 

i. 

MACT for Nitrogen Oxides.

 The average NO

X

 emission level for MWC's without postcombustion NO

X

 control (at both small and large MWC plants) is 225 ppmv. The best emission control system for controlling NO

X

 emissions from MWC's at large MWC plants is SNCR. The EPA's analysis of test data for existing MWC's (excluding modular
MWC's) equipped with SNCR indicates that an emission level of 180 ppmv can be continuously achieved. Therefore, the
MACT floor for NO

X

 for MWC's at large MWC plants is 180 ppmv (24-hour averaging period). 

As discussed in section IV.F.1.c of this preamble, the addition of SNCR postcombustion NO

X

 control has not been demonstrated on any modular MWC, and the performance of such a system on a modular MWC is in question.
Since the performance of an SNCR system on a modular MWC is in question, postcombustion NO

X

 control is not being considered for MWC's at small MWC plants; therefore, the MACT floor for NO

X

 for MWC's at small MWC plants is no control. 

The proposed MACT standard for NO

X

 for MWC's at large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 180 ppmv. The proposed MACT standard for NO

X

 for MWC's at small MWC plants is based on no control. Section IX of this preamble discusses the proposed ``no control''
NO

X

 standard for MWC's at small MWC plants.

G. Selection of Format for the Proposed Standards 



The February 11, 1991 NSPS described a format for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC operating practices (CO, load, and flue
gas temperature at the PM control device inlet) and NO

X

, and that same format is being adopted by today's proposed NSPS except for dioxins/furans. The selection of the format
for the standards for the above pollutants, is described in previous 

Federal Register

 notices (54 FR 52251, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). The specific formats of the proposed standards
for Cd, Pb, and Hg are discussed below. For dioxins/furans, the revised format is in units of either TEQ or total mass
dioxin/furans. 

As required by section 129(a)(4) of the Act, the proposed standards would establish numerical limitations for Cd,
Pb, and Hg. For the purpose of regulating Cd and Pb, the format selected in the proposed NSPS for the numerical emission
limitations would be numerical concentration limits (mg/dscm) at 7 percent O

2

. For the purpose of regulating Hg, the format selected would be both a numerical concentration limit (mg/dscm) and
an alternative percentage reduction requirement. The numerical Hg emission limit reflects the emission level that
can be achieved based on activated carbon injection in combination with SD/FF controls. An alternative Hg percentage
reduction requirement may be met instead of the numerical emission limit because emissions of Hg can be highly variable
and dependent on the Hg input level. Even at the same MWC, test data show occasional spikes of high Hg emissions due to
variability in the waste feed. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, the 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be
consistently achievable; however, the control devices could achieve the 85-percent reduction during such episodes.
Therefore, a combination of a concentration limit and an optional percentage reduction format best assures the maximum
achievable Hg control while accommodating potential spikes in Hg emission levels. 

As discussed above, the proposed standards for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg include two formats: (1) a percent reduction format, and (2) an emission limit (concentration) format.
The EPA requests comment on and test data supporting the appropriateness of promulgating final standards for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg which include only the emission limit format. For each pollutant, the commenter should specify an appropriate
emission limit (without an associated alternative percent reduction format) and provide rationale for the limit.
Based on the comments received, the EPA may promulgate final standards for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg in the form of emission limits that are higher or lower than the proposed emission limits. 

The EPA has proposed emission limits that reflect the performance levels achieved by MWC's equipped with properly
designed, constructed, and operated air pollution control systems. The proposed standards would apply during all
periods of MWC operation. To comply with the proposed standards, the air pollution control system would be designed
and operated such that actual emissions are less than the proposed emission limits. Where continuous monitoring
systems are available, such as for SO

2

 and NO

X

, the proposal would require their use to determine compliance on a continuous basis. For other pollutants, an annual
stack test would be required. The EPA requests comment on whether continuous monitoring methods exist for any additional
pollutants. 

The EPA also seeks comments on alternate formats of the standard that would encourage optimal control system operation
and optimal performance, thus minimizing emissions. For example, the standard could provide incentives, such as
reduced testing and reporting, for MWC's that operate well below the emission limit. One approach would be to structure
the standard such that, for an MWC with multiple units, if all units demonstrated emissions at least 30 percent less
than the limit, then only one of the units would be tested each year. The unit selected for testing would be rotated such
that each unit would be tested during its rotational cycle (e.g., once every three years, for an MWC plant with three
units). 

Another potential regulatory approach to assure optimal performance would be to supplement the current emission
limits (which must be demonstrated by annual stack tests) with more stringent emission limits calculated for each
pollutant based on long-term average emission levels. Compliance with this supplemental limit would be determined
by continuous monitoring, where applicable, or by the average of the annual emissions tests from the current year
and one or more preceding years. The current limits account for variability from one emissions test to another, whereas
the composite average emission limits would reflect the mean performance level over the life of the plant. This may
be a preferable measure of environmental performance for some of the pollutants because it is their long term or cumulative
emissions that are of most concern. Other formats of the standard that encourage optimal performance would also be
possible. Comments and suggestions are requested. Based on the information and comments received, the EPA may change
the form of the rule to include a long term emissions average, an alternative compliance testing schedule, or other
alternative format to encourage optimal performance of the air pollution control system.

Additionally, the EPA requests comment and suggestions on specific work practice requirements or equipment requirements
that would assure optimal operation of the air pollution control system and minimize emissions. Such operating practices
or equipment practices would be most beneficial for minimizing emissions of those pollutants for which annual stack
testing is the proposed compliance test method. Comments are specifically requested on work practice standards
or equipment requirements that would minimize dioxin/furan, Hg, Cd, and PM emissions. Based on the information received,
the EPA may require specific work practices or equipment to supplement the emission limits included in the final standards.




H. Performance Test Methods and Monitoring Requirements 



The NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 for MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day established performance
testing and monitoring requirements for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC operating practices (CO, load, and flue
gas temperature), and NO

X

. These testing and monitoring requirements are described in the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488).
These same testing and monitoring requirements will apply to MWC's at all size plants under today's proposed NSPS,
except that: (1) Procedures are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis; (2) continuous
monitoring of NO

X

 is not required at small plants; (3) provisions have been incorporated to allow compliance testing every third year
for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl at small plants that pass their compliance test for 3 years in a row; and (4) annual opacity
tests using EPA Reference Method 9 (in combination with continuous monitoring of opacity level) would be required
for both large and small MWC plants. Furthermore, today's proposal includes new data availability requirements
for CEMs. Today's proposal requires that valid paired CEMs hourly averages (i.e., SO

2 

and O

2 

(or CO

2

), NO

X 

and O

2 

(or CO

2

), and CO and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the MWC is operating
and combusting MSW. 

Because the proposed NSPS allows compliance with a dioxin/furan limit either on a TEQ basis or on a total mass basis,
procedures are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. For measuring dioxins/furans,
on a TEQ basis, the mass of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa- congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method
23. Then, each congener mass would be adjusted by the corresponding TEF's, which are listed in the proposed NSPS. Finally,
the adjusted congener masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in terms of nanograms per dry standard
cubic meter TEQ. 

Under the proposed standards, if three consecutive annual compliance tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate
compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (i.e., dioxins/furans, PM, or HCl), the MWC would be allowed to
wait 3 years before retesting for the pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year shows compliance with
the emission limit for the pollutant, then the facility could again wait 3 years to wait for the pollutant. If noncompliance
with the emission limit for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required to be undertaken and annual
testing would be required to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with the emission limit established.
At a minimum, performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl must be performed for each MWC at a small MWC plant every
3 years. This provision is included to minimize costs for small plants, while still retaining periodic testing to
ensure compliance. 

Testing and monitoring requirements are being proposed today to ensure control of Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions. For Cd,
Pb, and Hg, an initial performance test would be required for MWC's at small and large plants to determine compliance
with the proposed emission limits. The performance test for Cd, Pb, and Hg would be conducted in accordance with EPA
Reference Method 29. The number and location of sampling points would be determined using EPA Reference Method 1,
and flue gas analysis would be performed using EPA Reference Method 3. All performance tests would consist of a minimum
of three test runs conducted under representative full load operating conditions. The average Cd, Pb, and Hg emission
rates of three test runs or more would be used to determine compliance. 

Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate compliance with the Cd, Pb,
and Hg emission limits for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing for these three pollutants every
third year. At a minimum, performance tests for Cd, Pb, and Hg would be required to be conducted by small MWC plants every
3 years. Large plants would be required to test for Cd, Pb, and Hg annually. These annual testing requirements are consistent
with those for other pollutants, and MWC plants can reduce testing expenses by testing for multiple pollutants during
the same test period. 

Studies conducted by the EPA have shown EPA Reference Method 29 to be a more reliable method for measuring Hg from MWC's
than EPA Reference Method 101A. Recent refinements have been made to Method 101A, but the EPA has concluded that Method
29 remains a superior method. 

In a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

, EPA Reference Method 29 is being proposed for determining emissions of Hg and other metals from MWC's, MWI's, and
power plants. Method 29 consists of a particulate filter followed in series by two nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide
(HNO

3

/H

2

O

2

) impingers and two acidified potassium permangenate (KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

) impingers. The method is identical to the EPA's Office of Solid Waste multimetals method, except that Method 29 requires
filtration and analysis of the impinger solution collected in the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers. These filtration and analysis requirements are being added to the method for quality assurance purposes
to protect against the loss of Hg in the manganese oxide (MnO

) precipitate that can form in this solution. This additional step will result in similar sample preparation and analysis
requirements for EPA Reference Methods 29 and 101A.

The EPA does not believe that addition of the filtration and analysis step will change the achievable Hg emission rates
for MWC's and MWI's. Because of the significant amount of chlorine in MWC and MWI flue gas, most of the Hg in these flue
gases occurs as water-soluble ionic Hg. As a result, use of Method 29 collects most of the Hg in these flue gases on the
filter and in the HNO

impingers, with the remainder collected in the KMnO

impingers. Flue gases emitted from processes having lower chlorine levels and/or higher sulfur levels (e.g., coal-fired
power plants) have a higher fraction of their Hg emissions present as water-insoluble elemental Hg that is collected
in the KMnO

In testing conducted by the EPA at an MWC during which Method 101A KMnO

 impinger solutions were filtered and the filters analyzed (with Method 101A, all of the Hg in the flue gas is collected
by the KMnO

impingers), results showed that less than 3 percent of the total Hg collected by the sampling train was associated
with precipitated MnO

2

. Based on review of analytical procedures used with multimetal trail samples collected during several other EPA-sponsored
test programs, the EPA believes the potential loss of Hg in precipitated MnO

2

 during these tests was less than 3 percent (during these tests, the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4 

impingers were shaken prior to removal of a representative analytical sample and, thus, a portion of any precipitated
MnO

2 

was likely to have been included in the analytical sample). 

Because the analytical filter makes only a negligible difference in the Hg test results for MWC's and because it is
desirable to use a uniform Hg test method for all source categories, the EPA is proposing that the full Method 29 test
procedures (including the analytical filter analysis) be used for measuring Hg emissions from MWC's. 

Overall, the proposed guidelines would require that CEMS be used as the compliance test method for those pollutants
for which CEMS are available (i.e., SO

2

, NO

X

, CO, CO

2 

(or O

2

), opacity, MWC load level, and air pollution control device temperature). For those pollutants for which CEMS are
not available (i.e., HCl, Hg, Cd, Pb, PM, and dioxins/furans), the proposed guidelines would require that stack test
methods be used on an annual basis to determine compliance. Progress continues to be made on the development of new
and improved CEMS. The EPA requests comment on the availability of CEMS to replace stack testing for any of the pollutants
listed above. The EPA specifically requests comment on the availability, precision, accuracy, and cost of CEMS for
HCl and Hg. Based on the information received, the EPA will reconsider CEMS requirements and may increase the number
of pollutants monitored by CEMS. 



I. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 



The proposed standards would require owners and operators of all affected facilities to submit notifications of
construction or reconstruction, date of anticipated startup, and anticipated date of demonstration of the continuous
emission monitoring system (CEMS) (if applicable), as required under  60.7 of subpart A of part 60. 

The NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 include reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC acid gases, MWC
metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furan), MWC operating practices, and NO

X

. These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in the previous 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). Under today's proposed standards, these same reporting and recordkeeping
requirements would apply to MWC's at both small and large plants with the following four exceptions: (1) Dioxin/furan
emissions would be recorded and reported either in terms of dioxin/furan TEQ or as total mass of dioxins/furans; (2)
monitoring and reporting of NO

X 

emissions would not be required for small plants because NO

X 

control is not applicable; (3) if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria allowing them to conduct compliance tests
for dioxin/furans, PM, or HCl every third year, they would submit a simplified report for years when a full compliance
test was not required; and (4) both small and large MWC plants would be required to report the results of annual method
9 opacity tests. 

The reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the proposed NSPS are necessary to inform enforcement personnel
of the compliance status of new MWC's that begin operation. 

In addition, the records would provide the data and information necessary to ensure continued compliance of these
MWC's with the proposed regulation. At the same time, these requirements would not impose an unreasonable burden
on MWC owners or operators. All required records and all quarterly and annual reports must be maintained for 5 years
following the date of such records or submittal of such reports. All information contained in the records must be open
to the public. 

Recordkeeping and reporting requirements are being proposed in today's NSPS for Cd, Pb, and Hg. After the initial
performance test has been completed, the proposed standard would require the submission of annual compliance reports
for Cd, Pb, and Hg for MWC's at both small and large plants. However, if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria allowing
them to conduct compliance tests for Cd, Pb, or Hg every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for
years in which a full compliance test was not required. 

The proposed NSPS would require that certain types of records be maintained. If an activated carbon injection system
is used for Hg control, MWC plants would be required to keep records of the quantity of activated carbon used for each
8-hour period of MWC operation. These records would provide documentation that these systems continue to be operated
properly between compliance tests. The proposed NSPS would also require the submittal of initial and annual compliance
reports for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions testing for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants. 

Additionally, today's proposal would require that the siting analysis, materials separation plan, and summary
of response to public comment be submitted to the State. Refer to section V.D of this preamble for a discussion of the
proposed reporting requirements. 



V. Rationale for the Proposed Standards for Siting Requirements 



This section presents the EPA's rationale for establishing the proposed siting requirements, including a siting
analysis, a materials separation plan, and public meetings. 



A. Overview 



Under authority of section 129 of the Act, the EPA is proposing siting requirements for new MWC's. As proposed, the
siting requirements include three major components: (1) A siting analysis, (2) a materials separation plan, and
(3) public meetings with responses to public comments. These siting requirements would apply only to MWC units at
MWC facilities with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW, for which the initial application
for a construction permit under 40 CFR part 51, subpart I, or part 52 is submitted after the date of promulgation of the
final rule. These siting requirements would not apply to existing MWC's.

B. Siting Analysis 



The following discussion presents the EPA's rationale for proposing the requirement for sources to prepare a siting
analysis, including the various siting approaches considered and the proposed siting analysis. 



1. Siting Analysis Approaches Considered 



The EPA considered four approaches in the development of proposed siting analysis requirements. These approaches
are summarized below. 

The first approach would require that an environmental assessment be conducted, patterned on requirements under
the National Environmental Policy Act. This would require an examination of impacts in all media (i.e., air, water,
solid waste, energy, and land use). It would also require a description of alternatives to the proposed project including
alternative sites, technologies, or design. The elements of this approach would cover a range of health and environmental
impacts that can be considered in siting an MWC. However, many of these elements are addressed in current Federal,
State, or local permitting processes or review procedures. 

The second approach is patterned after the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Requirements for siting
hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. It consists of an exclusion list with the provision
that an MWC cannot be sited in certain locations (e.g., in a 100-year floodplain or over a high-quality groundwater
resource) unless ``it can be shown to the satisfaction of EPA'' that no adverse impact will occur. 

The third approach would be a regulatory review approach. Under this approach, the MWC owner or operator would prepare
a document listing all current Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements and permit conditions that apply
to the proposed MWC, along with a discussion of the equipment, construction practices, operating practices, and
other conditions used to comply with each requirement. This approach addresses relevant siting issues, and would
not require duplicate analyses of health or environmental impacts that are already required under other authorities
(e.g., New Source Review (NSR) air permits, National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water discharge
permits, stormwater permits, wetland permits, State solid waste permits, or local zoning permits). 

The fourth approach would establish general siting requirements patterned after requirements currently in use
under the NSR program. This approach would require an analysis of the impact of the facility, taking into account other
major industrial facilities near the proposal site, on ambient air quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation.
This approach has already been successfully implemented under the NSR program. Under this approach, facilities
may be able to use analyses conducted under the NSR program to comply with the NSPS siting requirements. This approach
would also involve public meetings, and the facility owner or operator would be required to prepare summaries and
comments to the public comments received at the public meetings. 



2. Proposed Siting Analysis 



The EPA is proposing the fourth approach, as discussed above, as the basis for the proposed siting analysis. The first
three approaches were considered to either overlap with current requirements or be overly complex. Under the proposal,
MWC owners or operators would be required to conduct an analysis of the impact of the proposed facility on ambient air
quality, visibility, soils, and vegetation. Furthermore, this analysis would be required to consider the air quality,
visibility, soils, and vegetation impacts of other major industrial facilities located near the planned MWC. Consideration
of the impacts of other local facilities would involve an analysis of both background air quality levels and emissions
from other sources in the area prior to operation of the planned MWC and total air emissions in the area after addition
of the planned MWC due to the incremental impact of the planned MWC. 

The EPA believes that requiring this type of siting analysis would allow facilities to use the same type of siting analysis
for complying with both NSR and NSPS requirements. The Agency invites comments regarding the proposed siting analysis,
including suggestions of alternative approaches.

C. Materials Separation/Materials Management Planning 



The following discussion presents the EPA's rationale for proposing the requirement for sources to prepare a materials
separation plan. 



1. Background 



As State and local governments plan for solid waste management, the EPA has encouraged them to employ the Integrated
Solid Waste Management (ISWM) approach. Through ISWM, communities achieve flexibility by looking beyond a single
solution. In tailoring systems to meet their unique needs, communities consider all four elements of ISWM: Reduction,
recycling, combustion, and landfilling, as described in EPA's document entitled ``An Agenda for Action''. In this
integrated approach, systems are designed so that some or all of the four waste management options are used as a complement
to one another to safely and efficiently manage municipal solid waste. The system is ``custom designed'' to meet local
environmental, economic, and institutional needs. A key element of integrated waste management is the hierarchy,
which favors source reduction (including reuse) to decrease the volume and toxicity and increase the useful life
of products in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste. Recycling (including composting) is the preferred
waste management option to further reduce potential risks to human health and the environment, divert waste from
landfills and combustors, conserve energy, and slow the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources. In implementing
source reduction and recycling, shifting risks from one medium to another (e.g., groundwater to air) or from one population
to another must be avoided. Landfills and combustors will be necessary for the foreseeable future to handle a significant
portion of wastes, but are lower on the hierarchy because of the potential risks to human health and the environment
and long-term management costs. This risk potential can be largely minimized through proper design and management.
Integrated waste management can and should be implemented at a local level to the extent practical, and is a useful
conceptual tool for making management decisions; however, it must be considered in the context of each community's
unique waste and demographic characteristics. Diversion of solid waste by reducing the quantity generated and by
recycling materials from the waste stream can effectively reduce the burden on MWC's and landfills. 

Waste diversion has become increasingly popular at the local level, as well as nationally and internationally, as
the tool to reduce waste going to MWC's or landfills. In 1989, the EPA challenged the nation to reduce and recycle 25
percent of MSW by 1992. The EPA called on all sectors of our society to voluntarily assume responsibility for helping
to attain this goal. Today, many states have source reduction programs, including, for example, yard waste composting,
fee-for-service programs, and industrial/commercial waste minimization programs. In fact, all but eight States
have established waste diversion goals. These goals vary, but generally call for diversion of 20 to 60 percent of the
solid waste stream and are to be attained over the next 5 years. 

With EPA encouragement, communities are increasingly using the ``variable rate fee'' approach to charge for waste
management services. This approach fosters waste reduction and recycling because the waste generators are charged
only for the amount of waste they produce that must be combusted or landfilled. Waste generators can reduce the amount
they pay for services by reducing the amount of waste they produce or by recycling more materials, thereby diverting
materials from MWC's and landfills. 

Across the nation, residents, businesses, and communities are using a variety of approaches to collect, separate,
and otherwise prepare recovery materials for recycling. These materials may be sorted into different categories
at the point of generation (e.g., residences or businesses) for separate collection, or they may be collected together
and taken to a regional or community facility for sorting and processing for recycling. 

The collection of recovered materials has grown dramatically and continues to increase. According to EPA studies,
the national recycling rate was only 9 percent in 1980 and grew to 17 percent by 1992. The EPA estimates the current national
recycling rate at about 22 percent. Certain States and communities report even higher rates. Across the nation, materials
that formerly were relegated to combustion or landfilling are being recovered for recycling. Waste reduction and
recycling are increasingly becoming key factors in the sizing, design, and siting of MWC's and landfills.

Markets for recycled materials are critical to the success of recycling, and this has been recognized both here and
abroad. In the United States, States have been creative in developing a variety of nonregulatory approaches to spur
markets. These include several measures to help start new businesses using recovered materials and to help existing
businesses convert to the use of recovered materials, such as: (1) Information and technical assistance, (2) financing
assistance, (3) direct financial assistance, (4) tax breaks (i.e., credits and exemptions), and (5) ``buy recycled''
programs to encourage the purchase of goods made from recovered materials. 
The EPA continues to be instrumental in enhancing markets for goods from recycled materials. In an effort to position
the Federal community in a leadership role, the EPA is providing guidelines to assist Federal procurement agencies
in buying increasing quantities of goods made from recovered materials. In October 1993, an Executive Order was signed
by the President of the United States directing Federal agencies to procure goods made from recovered materials,
harnessing the purchasing power of the Federal community to strengthen markets for these materials. 
There are substantial public and private sector efforts underway across the nation to foster markets for recycled
goods. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade has recently announced that by late 1994 they will add recyclable plastics
and glass to their listing of commodities. From these efforts, the demand for recovered materials will grow to complement
the increasing supply of materials diverted from the solid waste stream as more communities implement the ISWM approach.
This diversion will impact the characteristics of the remaining portion of the waste stream. 


2. Proposed Materials Separation Plan 



The design of any element of an ISWM system, whether a landfill or an MWC, must necessarily reflect the impact of the
other elements. To provide for proper sizing and other elements of the landfill or MWC design, it is important to consider
current and projected waste generation rates and the impact of source reduction and diversion on the character of
the remaining waste stream that serves as the MWC feedstock. Today's proposal is consistent with and complements
the ISWM approach by providing for an assessment of the impact of materials separation on municipal waste combustion.


Under today's proposal, prior to applying for a permit to construct a new MWC, the owner or operator of the MWC would
be required to submit a materials separation plan for public review and comment. Today's proposal would require the
materials separation plan to be applicable to the area served by the MWC. No rigid performance levels, specification
of separation system design, or designation of materials to be separated are specified in the proposal. 

The proposal allows the materials separation plan to be tailored to the service area, considered in the design of the
new MWC, and reviewed by the public prior to construction of the MWC. The materials separation plan may be optimized
for the entire service area, so that certain subareas may have materials separation requirements while other subareas
may not have materials separation requirements. This approach is fully consistent with EPA's ISWM goals for both
MWC's and landfills. 
The Agency invites comments regarding the proposed materials separation plan requirements, including suggestions
of alternative approaches. A definition of ``materials separation plan'' has been included in the definitions section
( 60.51b) of the proposed NSPS. 
The above requirements for a materials separation plan are being proposed only for new MWC's and are not being proposed
for existing MWC's. The MWC industry has made impressive progress in implementing materials separation programs
at existing MWC's, and this should be encouraged. 


D. Public Meeting and Reporting Requirements 


The proposed NSPS requires that the MWC owner or operator make the materials separation plan available to the public
in the service area where the affected facility is to be constructed. As part of making this information available
to the public, the MWC owner or operator would be required to distribute a preliminary draft materials separation
plan to all public libraries in the affected service area and to publish a notification of the public meeting in the
principal newspaper(s) serving the area where the MWC will be sited and where the waste will be collected. The MWC owner
or operator would then be required to hold a public meeting and accept comments on the preliminary draft materials
separation plan. The public meeting would be required to be held in the county where the MWC is to be constructed and
would be required to be scheduled 30 days or more after making the materials separation plan available to the public
and publishing the notification of the public meeting.

<TEXT>
 

At the public meeting, information should be provided that summarizes what materials are planned for separation,
how they will be separated, what service areas will be included in the plan, and what level of separation is expected.
The information presented at the meeting should also identify the amount of MSW that is expected to remain after the
separation plan is implemented and identify alternative disposal methods available for the waste (e.g., local MWC,
local landfill, long-distance transport to an MWC, or long-distance transport to a landfill). The following hypothetical
plan and discussion serve as an example of the types of information that would be provided at the meeting. At the public
meeting, a plan is proposed that: (1) Yard waste be collected from specific residential areas using a curbside collection
program, and (2) corrugated paper be collected from commercial facilities in specific commercial area using dumpster
pickup. The plan is expected to reduce the overall MSW stream by 20 percent, resulting in a residual MSW stream of approximately
400 Mg/day to be disposed of by either a local MWC or a local landfill. 
Although not included as a component of today's proposal, the EPA encourages the development and public presentation
of a supplementary regional waste management plan. Such plans have already been developed for many areas. Presentation
of a materials management plan at the initial materials separation public meeting would inform the public about current
regional waste management plans if such plans existed. If a regional management plan does not exist, the meeting would
provide the opportunity for local public input into the development of a regional solid waste management plan. A waste
management plan would focus on the full range of options available to manage municipal solid waste, as exemplified
in ISWM. Such a plan could include an analysis of the current waste generation situation and the range of strategies
that are currently used to deal with municipal solid waste, including the following examples: current waste generation
rates; existing waste disposal options (e.g., landfills versus MWC's); current source reduction (e.g., composting
and waste disposal fees); and materials separation and recycling programs. The materials management plan could
consider the adequacy of current strategies to handle projected waste generation. 
Finally, as in the integrated management approach called for under ISWM, the whole range of strategies available
to meet projected waste disposal needs could be fully examined and considered. This could include consideration
of the role of landfilling, the role of MWC application, the role of source reduction, and the role of materials separation
and recycling. The materials separation management plan could outline the expected cost of these alternative strategies
to the public, including the cost per Mg of municipal waste disposed (or the cost of waste disposal avoided), and their
impact in terms of waste disposal capacity or waste generation avoided. 
As mentioned above, a materials management plan is not part of the proposed siting requirements. The proposed siting
requirements include the development of only a materials separation plan. However, the materials separation plan
and regional materials management plan are closely related, and public input in their development is encouraged.

The MWC owner or operator would be required to prepare responses to the comments received at the public meeting. The
MWC owner or operator would be required to make the document summarizing responses to the public comments available
to the public in the service area where the MWC is to be located, including distribution to all public libraries in the
service area. The MWC owner or operator would then be required to submit the final draft materials separation plan
and the document summarizing responses to public comments to the State or the EPA, as applicable, prior to the facility's
application for a construction permit under NSR (40 CFR part 51, subpart I, or part 52, as applicable). The EPA concluded
that the draft materials separation plan should be submitted during the initial planning process with the application
for a construction permit to be fully consistent with the EPA's ISWM approach and to ensure that the facility is designed
to meet the materials separation goals of the region or community. Following application for a NSR construction permit,
the public would again have the opportunity to review and comment on the final draft materials separation plan at the
public meeting that would be held for public review of the siting analysis, as discussed below. The final materials
separation plan would be submitted with the initial notification of construction.

<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed NSPS also requires that, during the period of review of the materials separation plan and NSR application
for a construction permit, the MWC owner or operator make the MWC siting analysis available to the public in the service
area where the affected facility is to be constructed. As part of making this information available to the public,
the MWC owner or operator would be required to distribute the siting analysis to all public libraries in the affected
service area and to publish a notification of the public meeting in the principal newspaper(s) serving the area where
the MWC will be sited and where the waste will be collected. The MWC owner or operator would then be required to hold a
public meeting and accept comments on the siting analysis. The public meeting would be required to be held in the county
where the MWC is to be constructed and would be required to be scheduled 30 days or more after making the siting analysis
available to the public and publishing the notification of the public meeting. Because the proposed siting analysis
is based on the NSR requirements, the EPA anticipates that if a public meeting is scheduled to address the environmental
impacts analysis required by the NSR program, the same public meeting could also be used to discuss the proposed siting
analysis. Also, as discussed above, the same public meeting would address the final draft materials separation plan.


The MWC owner or operator would be required to prepare responses to the comments received at the public meeting and
to make the document summarizing responses to public comments available to the public in the service area where the
MWC is to be located, including distribution to all public libraries in the service area. The MWC owner or operator
would be required to submit the siting analysis, the final materials separation plan, and the document summarizing
responses to public comments on the siting analysis and any additional public comment on the materials separation
plan as part of the facility's initial notification of construction. 

As discussed above, the final materials separation plan is submitted with the initial notification of construction
of the MWC. Under this proposal, after the final plan is submitted, no subsequent reporting would be required. However,
the EPA is considering requiring an annual materials separation report. The EPA requests comment on the usefulness
of using a materials separation report to document the effectiveness of the plan and any changes made to it, and to help
determine if any changes are warranted. Comment is also requested on appropriate means to ensure that the adopted
materials separation plan is implemented. Based on the comments received, the final regulation may require submission
of annual reports for assessing the performance of the materials separation plan. 



VI. Rationale for the Proposed Standards for Fugitive Fly Ash/Bottom Ash Emissions 



The following discussion addresses the basis for EPA's decision to regulate fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions
from MWC facilities. The available technologies for controlling these fugitive emissions and the EPA's selection
of MACT for these emissions are presented. 



A. Background 



Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions are emissions of dust from fly ash and bottom ash handling that are not confined
(i.e., emissions that are not contained within a fully enclosed ash handling system). The fly ash/bottom ash dust
consists of PM and various associated pollutants adsorbed to the PM such as Cd, Pb, Hg, and organic compounds (e.g.,
dioxins/furans). A study of MWC ash handling and storage facilities at best controlled MWC facilities has shown that
such facilities, when improperly controlled, can be sources of these pollutants through fugitive fly ash/bottom
ash emissions. Therefore, visible emissions standards for fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions are being proposed
to ensure control equipment and operating practices are implemented to eliminate such emissions. 



B. Fugitive Emission Control Techniques 



Sources of MWC fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions include fly ash and bottom ash conveyors and conveyor transfer
points, storage facilities (including ash storage bins or piles), and ash loading facilities for trucks or containers.


Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from conveyors that are not already inside enclosed structures can be controlled
by totally enclosing the conveyors. Emissions from conveyor transfer points can be controlled by totally enclosing
the transfer point and ventilating it to a control device if the transfer point is not inside an enclosed structure.
Alternatively, adequate moisture in the fly ash and bottom ash can be maintained to control fugitive emissions from
conveyors or transfer points. 

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash storage facilities at an MWC plant can be controlled by totally
enclosing the ash storage operations and by ensuring that the fly ash and bottom ash have an adequate moisture content
to prevent dust generation. Chemical stabilizers and binders may also be used in addition to or in place of moisture
to prevent dust emissions from MWC ash for nearly all the activities described in this section.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from loading ash into trucks or containers can be controlled by ensuring an
adequate moisture content of the ash, either by adding extra moisture (water) or by combining and mixing fly ash with
bottom ash that has passed through a water-filled quench tank. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash
loading facility may also be controlled by enclosing the ash loading facility, fitting the truck bays with doors that
can be closed, and discharging the vent air to a control device. 

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from moving trucks used for hauling ash can be controlled by ensuring that the
ash is moist and that the truck or container is properly sealed and covered during transit. Truck tires can be washed
prior to leaving the ash handling facility to prevent ash from being tracked onto roadways where it can later become
airborne as fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. Additional emissions control can be achieved by reducing ash
spills during loading and by recovering any spilled ash through sweeping, vacuuming, or washing before the spilled
ash can be tracked out of the facility. 

Data collected at several MWC's indicate that when the control methods described above are applied in a consistent
and conscientious manner, fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions can be controlled so that no visible emissions are
observed from the ash storage facilities, ash transfer points, ash loading to trucks or containers, and trucks hauling
MWC ash. 



C. Proposed Fugitive Emissions Standards 



A standard of no visible fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash handling and storage facilities and transfer
points is being proposed and is consistent with the determination that the controls described above represent MACT.
Section 129 of the Act requires that standards for new sources cannot be less stringent than the control achieved in
practice by the best controlled similar source. The controls described above are in place at the ash handling and storage
facilities at many MWC's and are the most stringent available controls for new MWC's. 

Therefore, fugitive emission standards are consistent with MACT and are being proposed. Fugitive fly ash/bottom
ash emissions from any MWC ash storage facility or any ash transfer point at an MWC plant with aggregate capacity to
combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW would have to be controlled so that no visible emissions shall be detected. 

The fly ash/bottom ash visible emission standard will be determined using EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous
visual observation). Compliance with the visible emissions standards would be determined by an annual performance
test. Reports of initial and annual performance tests would be required. 

Any technology may be used to meet these standards. The fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions standards would apply
to ash handling facilities within the property boundary of the MWC, but would not apply to offsite transport of ash.




VII. Proposed Standards for Air Curtain Incinerators 



Air curtain incinerators operate by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across the top of an open chamber or pit.
The air curtain reduces emissions during operation by promoting better combustion. Incinerators of this type are
built either above or below ground and typically have refractory walls and a floor. Section 129 of the Act exempts air
curtain incinerators firing MSW from the definition of ``municipal waste combustion unit'' provided that the air
curtain incinerator burns only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber, and that it complies with
an opacity limit that would be established by the EPA. As clarified under the proposed NSPS, ``untreated lumber''
means that the lumber has not been painted, pigment-stained, or ``pressure treated.'' 

Today's proposed NSPS includes opacity limits specifically for air curtain incinerators that would combust greater
than 35 Mg/day of yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber. The proposed opacity limits are 10-percent
opacity (6-minute average), except that a level of up to 35 percent (6-minute average) would be allowed during the
first 30 minutes of operation of the unit. The proposed opacity limits are based on levels achieved by well-designed
and operated air curtain incinerators. Compliance with the proposed air curtain incinerator opacity limits would
be demonstrated by conducting an annual compliance test in accordance with EPA Reference Method 9. 

Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35 Mg/day that burn MSW other than yard wastes, tree trimmings,
or clean untreated lumber are covered by the NSPS for MWC's. Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35
Mg/day that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber would be subject to the proposed opacity
standard and its associated testing, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements, but would not be subject to any
other parts of the proposed NSPS. 



VIII. Comparison of the Proposal and European Emission Limits for MWC's 



Europe is more densely populated than the United States and the combustion of MSW became increasing common after World
War II. Because European countries have more experience combusting MSW, it is interesting to compare the emission
control requirements for MWC's located in the Member States of the European Union (EU) to those for MWC's in the United
States. In addition to comparing emission requirements, the EPA also compared the prevalence of waste combustion
in the United States and the EU.

In general, MSW combustion is more common in the EU than in the United States. There are 12 members of the EU: Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal.
The percentage of waste combusted in many of the EU countries is over 30 percent, with Denmark, Luxembourg, and the
Netherlands, combusting 60, 60, and 40 percent of their waste, respectively. As a national average for the United
States, 16 percent of the waste generated is combusted. In the Eastern United States, where the majority of MWC's are
located, the rate of waste combustion is higher, averaging 25 to 30 percent. In the New England region, the rate of waste
combustion approaches 60 percent. Therefore, although the United States as a whole has a much lower rate of waste combustion
than does the EU, certain regions of the United States have combustion rates similar to those in the EU.

Factors such as population density, percentage of urbanization, land availability, and topography/geology influence
the method of waste disposal for a country or a region. In the EU, the majority of the countries have population densities
that range from 200 to 600 people per square mile and urban population percentages of 60 to 90 percent. The United States,
in comparison, has a much lower average population density of approximately 70 people per square mile, and the percentage
of the population living in urban areas is approximately 75 percent. In the Eastern United States, the population
density and percentage of urban population are higher than national levels, at around 200 people per square mile with
over 80 percent of the population living in urban areas, which is comparable to most of Europe. As noted above, other
factors contribute to the use of MWC technology. For example, in Florida, the geology is such that in some cases landfilling
waste is not a desirable option. Similarly, the mountainous regions in parts of Europe restrict the use of landfilling,
and the increased use of MWC's is common.

Regarding regulatory development in the EU, the EU sets uniform environmental guidelines, and individual EU countries
may adopt those guidelines or more stringent requirements. This is similar to the role the EPA plays with the individual
States. Table 5 presents: (1) The proposed EPA NSPS for new MWC plants with capacities above 35 and 225 Mg/day and (2)
the EU guidelines that apply to new MWC plants with capacities greater than 72 Mg/day.

As shown in table 5, the EU guidelines cover many of the same pollutants as the EPA NSPS proposed in today's notice. There
are differences between the EPA standards and the EU guidelines with regard to regulatory flexibility for demonstrating
compliance, as well as the test methods used to measure emissions. Factors like these should be considered when comparing
emission requirements. The EPA and EU both have set levels for PM, HC1, SO

2

, and CO. For these pollutants, the allowable emission levels proposed by the EPA are more restrictive than the EU guidelines.
No EU guidelines exist for NO

X

 or dioxins/furans, and the EU metals emission guidelines are for combined metals (e.g., Hg+Cd). As shown in table
5, the EPA NSPS for both large and small plants for Hg and Cd, if combined, are lower than the EU Hg+Cd guideline. 


Some of the EU countries have adopted limits that are more stringent than the general EU guidelines. For example, The
Netherlands has recently adopted standards for new and existing MWC's that are considered to be some of the most stringent
in the world. For example, the Dutch Hg limit of 0.065 mg/dscm for new MWC's (corrected to 7 percent O

2

) is lower than both the EU guideline and the EPA's proposed Hg standards. The Dutch dioxin/furan limit for new MWC's
is 0.13 ng/dscm TEQ. This limit is lower than the EPA's proposed standard of 0.20 ng/dscm TEQ or 13 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans.
The EU has no dioxin/furan limit. 


It is difficult to directly compare the Dutch standards to the EPA standards or to the performance of U.S. MWC's because
the test methods used in The Netherlands to measure emissions are different from those used in the United States. Several
new MWC plants are currently being constructed in The Netherlands and are expected to demonstrate compliance in 1995.



As with some of the EU countries, some of the individual States are establishing more stringent emissions standards
than those in today's proposed standards. Brief descriptions of the regulations under consideration in Florida,
Minnesota, and New Jersey are presented below. 


The State of Florida has promulgated a regulation that would set an Hg emission limit of 0.070 mg/dscm (corrected to
7 percent O

2

), or an 80-percent Hg reduction, for facilities that install Hg control equipment (e.g., activated carbon injection)
and that are equipped with acid gas control equipment. This limit must be met by July 1, 1995, and compliance must be
demonstrated annually using EPA Reference Method 101A. For facilities equipped with acid gas control equipment
that choose to control Hg exclusively through the use of an Hg waste separation program, Hg emissions would be limited
to 0.14 mg/dscm after July 1, 1995 and to 0.070 mg/dscm after July 1, 1997. Compliance must be demonstrated semiannually
using Reference Method 101A. Facilities not currently equipped with acid gas controls will be required to meet the
proposed Hg emission limits when the facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the acid gas limits included
in the EPA's proposal. Florida's rulemaking procedures to develop SO

2

 and HC1 emission limits will be initiated by December 1, 1994, unless the Federal regulations (today's action) have
been proposed by that date. 


The State of Minnesota has also promulgated Hg requirements for MWC's. For mass burn MWC's with acid gas control, the
quarterly Hg emission limit (one three-test run average) is 0.10 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O

2

). However, the annual average Hg emissions limit (average of the four most recent quarterly tests) is 0.060 mg/dscm.
Measurements must be made using EPA Reference Method 29. The Minnesota requirement also allows MWC's to demonstrate
compliance with the quarterly and annual limits by achieving an alternative 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions.



Similar to the Florida regulations, the Minnesota regulations provide less stringent standards for MWC's without
acid gas control until the time that acid gas control is required. 


The State of New Jersey will be proposing an Hg standard for MWC's of 0.028 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O

2

), which would be effective as of January 1, 2000, and an interim standard of 0.065 mg/dscm or an 80-percent reduction,
which would be effective as of December 31, 1995. The 0.028 mg/dscm limit is based on reducing the uncontrolled Hg emission
level (assumed to be 0.70 mg/dscm) by 80 percent through reduction of Hg in the waste burned, and another 80-percent
reduction from Hg in the flue gas. These limits are annual averages based on quarterly 3-run testing (i.e., a total
of 12 runs), using EPA Reference Method 29. 




IX. Miscellaneous 




This section addresses the two following issues: (1) The selection of a ``no control'' limit for NO

X

 for MWC's at small MWC plants, and (2) the July 14, 1992 remand of the issue of lead-acid vehicle battery combustion,
and (3) a general request for comment on the proposal. 


Regarding the first issue, section 129 of the Act specifies that standards for MWC's must include emission limits
for PM, opacity, SO

2

, HC1, NO

X

, CO, Pb, Cd, Hg, and dioxins/furans. This means that emission limits for these pollutants must be specified even if
the MACT selected for a subcategory of facilities does not control that particular pollutant. In particular, under
today's proposal, the MACT floor and MACT for NO

X

 control at small MWC plants is based on no control (see section IV.F.1.c for additional discussion). Therefore, a
``no control'' emission limit is proposed for NO

X

 emissions from small MWC plants. The proposed ``no control'' limit for NO

X

 for small MWC plants is 500 ppmv. This proposed limit is not intended to result in emissions control, and the proposal
does not include any testing, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements. The EPA expects that the ``no control''
limit will not be exceeded.


The 500 ppmv limit represents an emission level higher than any of the test data and allows an adequate margin to accommodate
the variability in NO

X

 emission levels. The EPA requests public comments on whether it is appropriate to include such a ``no control'' emission
limit in the final NSPS or whether such a limit is not necessary. 


Regarding the second issue, on December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed NSPS and emission guidelines for new and existing
MWC's under section 111 of the Act. The proposed NSPS and emission guidelines included a prohibition on the combustion
of lead-acid vehicle batteries in MWC's. On February 11, 1991, the EPA promulgated standards and guidelines for new
and existing MWC's that did not prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries. The decision not to prohibit
the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals by the NRDC, the State of
New York, and the State of Florida. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded
that the EPA had not adequately explained its decision not to require a lead acid battery separation as part of the 1991
NSPS and emission guidelines, when it had included such a requirement in its proposed rule (

State of New York 

v. 

Reilly

, 969 F.2d 1147, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). The EPA is not addressing the lead acid battery issue in this notice, but will
publish a separate notice in the 

Federal Register

 in the near future.

Regarding the third issue, the MWC regulations are complex, and the EPA expects to receive numerous comments on this
proposal. The EPA has specifically requested comments on items fundamental to the proposal, including but not limited
to the MACT floor, MACT performance levels, and materials separation plans. 




X. Administrative Requirements 




This section addresses the following administrative requirements: public hearing, docket, procedural requirements
of the Act, Office of Management and Budget review, and Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance. 




A. Public Hearing 




A public hearing will be held 15 days following proposal. The public hearing will discuss the proposed standards in
accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations at the public hearing should
contact the EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a
written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be mailed to the
Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble. 


A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during
normal working hours at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center in Washington, DC (see 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble). 




B. Docket 




The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered in the development
of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify
and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the record
in case of judicial review, except for interagency review material (section 307(d)(7)(A)) of the Act. The docket
number for this rulemaking is A-90-45. Docket No. A-89-08 also includes background information
for this rulemaking that supported the proposal and promulgation of the subpart Ea NSPS. 




C. Clean Air Act Procedural Requirements 




The following procedural requirements of the Act are addressed: administrative listing, periodic review, external
participation, and economic impact assessment. 




1. Administrator Listing_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act 




As prescribed by section 111 of the Act, establishment of standards of performance for MWC's is based on the Administrator's
determination (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987) that these sources contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably
be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directs the Administrator
to promulgate revised NSPS for new MWC's. 




2. Periodic Review_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act 




Sections 111 and 129 of the Act require that the regulation be reviewed not later than 5 years following the initial
promulgation. At that time and at 5-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review the regulation and
revise it if necessary. This review will include an assessment of such factors as the need for integration with other
programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology,
and reporting requirements. 




3. External Participation 




In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate
advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comments
on all aspects of the proposal, including economic and technological issues. 




4. Economic Impact Assessment 




Section 317A of the Act requires the EPA to prepare an economic impact assessment for any NSPS promulgated under section
111(b) of the Act. An economic impact assessment was prepared for the proposed standards. In the manner described
in sections III, IV, V, and VI of this preamble regarding the impacts of and rationale for the proposed standards, the
EPA considered all aspects of the economic impact assessment in proposing the standards. The economic impact assessment
is included in the list of key technical documents at the beginning of today's notice under 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

. 




D. Office of Management and Budget Reviews 




1. Paperwork Reduction Act 




The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1506.03) and a copy may be obtained
from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington,
DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260-2740. 


This collection of information is estimated to have an average annual reporting burden of about 0.81 person years
per recordkeeper (MWC facility). Very small MWC plants with capacities between 25 and 35 Mg/day will have a smaller
burden. These plants would only be required to submit reports of notification of construction, anticipated startup
date, and actual startup date. Small MWC plants with capacities between 35 and 225 Mg/day would incur the greatest
burden as a result of today's proposed standards. The reporting and recordkeeping burden for these plants would include
initial and annual testing and reporting of emissions of PM, Pb, Cd, Hg, dioxins/furans, and HC1; SO

2

 and CO CEMS demonstration and reporting; preparation of a site selection analysis report, and other requirements.



Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will address any
comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. 




2. Executive Order 12866 Review 




Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'', and therefore, subject to the OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order
defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: 


(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities; 


(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA considers the proposed NSPS not to be a ``significant'' rule
because the annual effect on the economy is expected not to exceed $43 million over the cost of the existing subpart
Ea NSPS. However, the EPA considers this proposed NSPS to be ``significant'' because of its relationship to the emission
guidelines for MWC's that are being proposed under a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. The proposed emission guidelines would cost about $450 million/year. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for
review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public docket for this
rulemaking. 



3. Executive Order 12875 



Under Executive Order 12875, the EPA is required to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal
governments, and keep these affected parties informed about the content and effect of the proposed standards. The
following discussion provides a brief summary of the content, need for, and cost of the proposal, as well as the actions
that the EPA has taken to communicate and consult with the affected parties. 

a.

 Summary of the Proposed Standards.

 The proposed NSPS would establish emission limitations for new MWC units located at MWC plants with plant capacities
to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW. The proposed standards do not specify which type of air pollution control
equipment must be used at MWC's to meet the proposed emission limitations. The EPA expects, however, that, as a result
of the proposal, most large MWC plants (plants with greater than 225 Mg/day capacity) would use scrubbing systems
(SD/FF) for dioxins/furans, metals, and acid gas control and SNCR for NO

X

 control. Small MWC plants (plants with 35 to 225 Mg/day capacity) would be expected to install scrubbing systems (SD/FF),
but SNCR technology would not be necessary. Refer to section II of this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the
proposed standards. 

b.

 Need for the Proposed Standards.

 Under the Act Amendments of 1990, section 129 includes a schedule that requires the EPA to adopt the standards for large
and small MWC plants by the end of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The EPA did not comply with that schedule and is now under
court order to propose the standards by September 1, 1994 and promulgate the standards by September 1, 1995. As required
by section 129, the proposed standards would establish emission limits for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals
(Cd, Pb, Hg, PM, and opacity), MWC acid gases (HCl and SO

2

), and NO

X

. See section I of this preamble for further discussion of the regulatory history and general goals of the proposed
standards. 

c.

 Cost of the Proposal.

 The national cost of the proposed NSPS would be about $43 million per year. The subpart Ea NSPS promulgated in 1991 already
requires the installation of acid gas/PM control systems; therefore, the cost of installing acid gas/PM control
systems is not included in the $43 million per year national cost of the proposal (see section III.B of this preamble
for a discussion of national costs based on a pre-1989 baseline.) However, for perspective, the cost of the entire
air pollution control system (including acid gas/PM control systems) is provided here. For an individual combustor
subject to the proposed standards, the cost of the air pollution control system will vary depending on the plant size.
The average annualized cost of control required by the proposed standards for a typical large MWC plant would be about
$3.8 million per year. The average annualized cost of control of the proposed standards for a typical small MWC plant
would be about $0.84 million per year. Tipping fees at combustors currently average about $57/Mg of MSW combusted.
As a result of the air pollution control required by the proposal, the tipping fees for new MWC plants would typically
increase by $13 to $18/Mg, with the lower cost being for large MWC plants and the higher cost being for small MWC plants.
Regarding the impact of the proposed standards directly or indirectly on households, the EPA projects an increase
in the household cost of waste disposal of about $17 to $29 per year or about $2 per month for communities that have MWC's.
Refer to section III of this preamble for a more complete summary of the cost and economic impacts of the proposed NSPS,
on both national and plant-specific bases. 

d.

 Communication with Affected Parties.

 As previously mentioned, Executive Order 12875 requires the EPA to consult with representatives of affected State,
local, and tribal governments, and prior to promulgation of final standards, summarize concerns of the governmental
entities and respond to their comments. The EPA has already initiated consultations with numerous governmental
entities including, but not limited to, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National
Association of Counties, the Municipal Waste Management Association, and the Solid Waste Association of North America.
These groups have been informed of the content of the proposal and the estimated impacts. In drafting the proposal,
the EPA has considered the concerns expressed by these groups, and discussions with these groups will continue following
proposal. Following proposal, the EPA will mail a copy of this proposal to all owners/operators of MWC's and their
associated local governmental official. The EPA awaits their comments on the proposal and will respond to their comments.

E. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires Federal agencies to give special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small entities, which
are small businesses, small organizations, and small governments. The major purpose of the RFA is to keep paperwork
and regulatory requirements from getting out of proportion to the scale of the entities being regulated, without
compromising the objectives of, in this case, the Act. 

If a regulation is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the EPA may
give special consideration to those small entities when analyzing regulatory alternatives and drafting the regulation.
In the case at hand, the EPA considers that a regulation that is likely to affect 20 percent or more of small entities
with MWC's is a regulation that will affect a substantial number of small entities. 

Definitions of small entities are flexible. For analysis of the regulations being proposed today, the EPA considers
a small business in this industry to be one with gross annual revenue less than $6 million, and a small government to
be one that serves a population less than 50,000. (A typical city of 50,000 generates about 90 Mg/day of MSW.) Most small
governments dispose of their MSW by landfilling and, therefore, will not be affected by regulation of MWC emissions.
In regard to small organizations such as independent not-for-profit enterprises, the EPA finds that they have no
more than a very minor involvement with MWC's, and for that reason the EPA has not found it necessary to study potential
direct impacts on small organizations. 

Many MWC's exist that range in size up to 35 Mg/day. The EPA estimates that MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity except for
MWI's, which are being regulated in a separate action, contribute a negligible fraction of total MWC emissions. Many
MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity, and a few larger ones, are owned or operated by small entities. The EPA estimates
that considerably fewer than 20 percent of small-entity MWC's would be affected by the standards being proposed today
were those MWC's to be constructed in the future. The EPA projects that the relative proportion of MWC's that are small-entity
MWC's combusting less than 35 Mg/day will remain the same in the future as it is today. 

Thus, the number of affected small entities is not expected to be substantial, and a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required. Nevertheless, the EPA has conducted an extensive analysis of potential regulatory impacts on households,
small governments, and small businesses. The analysis is summarized above in the discussion of regulatory cost and
economic impacts. The full analysis is included in the economic impact assessment in the docket and is listed at the
beginning of today's notice under

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 


On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed standards for MWC's that applied to all sizes of MWC's. The proposal had no lower
size cutoff. Small businesses, small governments, and groups representing small-entity interests commented extensively
on the need to lighten the potential regulatory burden on small entities. Most commenters suggested a small size cutoff
considerably smaller than the one now being proposed. The most frequently suggested levels were 5 to 11 Mg/day, 18
Mg/day, 23 Mg/day, and 45 Mg/day. The EPA has used these suggestions and the information submitted by these commenters,
as well as information from other sources, to fulfill the intent of the RFA. The EPA has incorporated into the regulation
being proposed today several features that will mitigate, and in most cases eliminate, any potential, adverse economic
impacts on small entities. These features are as follows: 

(1) The regulation will apply only to MWC's with a plant capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. This cutoff eliminates
from the purview of the regulation the overwhelming majority of projected new, very small MWC's (There will be a one-time
requirement for MWC plants in the 25 to 35 Mg/day range to report for verification the capacities and locations of the
plants, but this paperwork will impose no economic burden); 

(2) The regulation is ``tiered'' so that the stringency (and therefore potential economic burden) of the emission
standards increases as the size of the MWC plant increases. Plants with capacities less than or equal to 25 Mg/day are
not covered under the proposed NSPS. Plants with capacities of 25 to 35 Mg/day would have only the one-time reporting
requirement of capacity and location. Plants with capacities of 35 to 225 Mg/day are not required to control NO

x

. Only plants with capacities larger than 225 Mg/day_plants not often associated with small entities_are subject
to a full complement of rigorous standards; and 

(3) The regulation consists predominantly of emission standards, as opposed to design, equipment, work practice,
or operational standards. Emission standards give MWC owners and operators the freedom to select the most economical
means of compliance with the standards.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that this proposed regulation, if promulgated, will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the number of small entities
affected is not substantial.

Emission Guidelines: Municipal Waste Combustors 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed guidelines and notice of public hearing.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing new subpart Cb ``emission guidelines'' to be used by States in developing State regulations to
control emissions from existing municipal waste combustors (MWC's). Today's proposed guidelines would apply to
MWC's for which construction, modification, or reconstruction began on or before September 20, 1994.



Today's proposal would implement sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act). The proposed guidelines would apply
to existing MWC units at facilities with capacities to combust greater than 35 megagrams per day (Mg/day; a megagram
is a metric ton, and one megagram is equal to 2,204 pounds or about 1.1 short tons) of municipal solid waste (MSW) and
would require sources to achieve emission levels reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants
that the Administrator determines is achievable, taking into consideration the costs, non-air-quality health
and environmental impacts, and energy impacts. The proposed guidelines would establish emission limits for MWC
acid gases (sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) and hydrogen chloride (HCl)), MWC metals (particulate matter (PM), opacity, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury
(Hg)), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), nitrogen oxides (NO

X

), and MWC fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. The proposed guidelines would also establish requirements for
MWC operating practices (carbon monoxide (CO), load, and flue gas temperature), and operator training and certification.

On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed emission guidelines for existing MWC's in subpart Ca of 40 CFR part 60. The subpart
Ca emission guidelines were promulgated on February 11, 1991 and were developed under authority of section 111 of
the Act of 1977. The Act of 1990 requires the EPA to review and revise, as necessary, the subpart Ca guidelines. The EPA
has reviewed the subpart Ca emission guidelines and has concluded that they are not adequate to comply with the requirements
of section 129 of the Act of 1990. In a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

, the EPA is proposing to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991. Today's
proposed subpart Cb guidelines would fully comply with the requirements of section 129 of the Act of 1990. 
The 

Federal Register

 notices for the proposed emission guidelines, withdrawal of the subpart Ca emission guidelines, and a proposed EPA
test method that is associated with the proposed guidelines, and the economic impacts analysis associated with the
proposed emission guidelines are listed below and are available on the EPA's Technology Transfer Network (TTN) electronic
bulletin board. Also listed below and available on the EPA's TTN is a FACT SHEET, which succinctly summarizes the proposal
and is suggested reading for persons requiring a limited overview of the proposal. The TTN contains 18 electronic
bulletin boards, and the items listed below are included in the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) bulletin board and

I. Introduction 



This section provides an introduction to the proposed rule by: (1) Summarizing the history of the development of emission
guidelines for existing MWC's over the past 7 years; (2) summarizing the general goals of the proposed rule that are
specified by sections 111(d) and 129 of the Act of 1990; and (3) providing a brief overview of the major issues discussed
in this preamble. 



A. Summary of Regulatory History 



Today's proposal is a result of a series of regulatory decisions that were initiated in 1987. During the early and mid-1980's,
studies were performed to determine whether MWC emissions should be regulated and, if so, under what section of the
Act. As set forth in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987), the EPA decided to regulate
air emissions from MWC's under section 111 of the Act as it existed prior to the 1990 Amendments. Section 111 of the Act
required that the regulations be based on best demonstrated technology (BDT). On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed
new source performance standards (NSPS) for new MWC's and emission guidelines for existing MWC's (54 FR 52251 and
54 FR 52209, respectively). On November 15, 1990, the Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted and added section 129 to the
Act. Section 129 of the Act specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance
with the requirements of sections 111 and 129. Section 129 further specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines
be developed for both large and small MWC's and that the NSPS and emission guidelines must reflect certain standards
of performance. Section 129 includes a schedule for revising the 1991 emission guidelines. When the EPA did not comply
with that schedule, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a complaint with the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The resulting consent decree requires the EPA Administrator
to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking not later than September 1, 1994 and a notice of promulgation not later than
September 1, 1995 (Nos. CV-92-2093 and CV-93-0284). 

The NSPS and guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488 and 56 FR 5514, respectively) apply to MWC's with
unit capacities above 225 Mg/day and reflect BDT as determined by the Administrator at the time those guidelines were
issued. Today's notice therefore proposes to create new emission guidelines to be fully consistent with sections
111 and 129 of the Act and to extend coverage of the guidelines to existing MWC units located at MWC facilities with aggregate
plant capacity above 35 Mg/day. In a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

, the EPA is proposing to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991. 

Under a separate regulatory action in today's 

Federal Register

, a new subpart Eb NSPS for new MWC plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day of MSW that are constructed after
September 20, 1994 is being proposed pursuant to sections 111(b) and 129 of the Act. Even though a new subpart Eb NSPS
is being proposed, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect. Municipal waste combustors constructed,
modified, or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 but on or before September 20, 1994 would be subject to both subpart
Ea (NSPS) requirements and today's proposed subpart Cb (guideline) requirements. In most cases, the control technologies
being used to meet the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS emission limits would be able to comply with the proposed subpart Cb guidelines,
except that additional controls would be required to reduce Hg emissions, dioxin/furan emissions, and fugitive
fly ash/bottom ash emissions.

The Act requires the promulgation of performance standards under section 111 for categories of new and existing stationary
sources that may contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.
Section 129 of the Act specifies that NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the
requirements of sections 111 and 129. Section 129(a)(2) provides that emission guidelines for existing MWC's reflect
the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of designated air pollutants, taking into consideration the cost of
achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements
that Administrator determines is achievable for a particular category of sources (this standard is commonly referred
to as ``maximum achievable control technology, or ``MACT''). Additionally, section 129 provides that the emissions
limitations in the guidelines for existing MWC's may not be less stringent than the average emissions limitation
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the category. This is referred to as the ``MACT floor.'' 

According to sections 111(d) and 129(b), States must submit to the Administrator, within 1 year of the EPA's promulgation
of the guidelines, a plan that accomplishes the following: (1) Establishes for existing sources emission standards
for designated pollutants; and (2) provides for implementation and enforcement of the emission standards. Section
129(b) provides that a State plan for existing MWC's be at least as protective as the emission guidelines. 

As specified in section 129 of the Act, States are required to submit to the Administrator a plan implementing the emission
guidelines within 1 year after the promulgation of the guidelines. This proposal further requires that a State plan
shall provide that each unit subject to the guidelines shall be in compliance with all requirements of the State plan
within 3 years following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required,
or within 3 years following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required. Section 60.24(e)(1)
of subpart B of part 60 requires that any compliance schedule extending more than 1 year from adoption of a State plan
shall include legally enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each designated facility. The
proposed emission guidelines include this requirement. This proposed compliance schedule is more comprehensive
than the compliance schedule and timetable specified in the subpart Ca emission guidelines promulgated on February
11, 1991 (56 FR 5514). The Act specifies that the procedure for State submission of a plan shall be similar to the procedure
for submission of State implementation plans under section 110. Section 129 specifies that the EPA, in reviewing
State plans for any variation from the emission guidelines, must ensure that State plans and their resulting MWC control
requirements are at least as protective as the EPA guidelines, including incorporation of the compliance scheduling
requirements established by the guidelines. The Act also provides that the EPA shall prescribe a plan according to
procedures similar to those in section 110(c) if a State fails to submit a ``satisfactory plan.'' 

Moreover, States that believe additional control is desirable may require more extensive controls, which might
have the effect of closing otherwise marginal facilities or banning a particular category of sources outright.

C. Overview of This Preamble 



This preamble will: 

(1) Summarize the proposed guidelines by discussing the conclusions reached with respect to each of the elements
in the decision summary; 

(2) describe the environmental, energy, and economic impacts of these proposed guidelines; 

(3) present a rationale for each of the decisions associated with this proposal; 

(4) present a regulatory flexibility analysis; and 

(5) discuss administrative requirements relevant to this action. 



II. Summary of the Proposed Subpart Cb MWC Emission Guidelines 


This section presents a summary of the proposed emission guidelines, including identification of the source category
and pollutants that would be regulated under the proposal, discussion of the format of the proposed guidelines, and
presentation of the proposed guidelines and their associated performance testing, monitoring, recordkeeping,
and reporting requirements. This section also provides a comparison of the emission guidelines in this proposed
subpart Cb versus the 1991 emission guidelines (subpart Ca). 



A. Source Category To Be Regulated 



Today's proposed emission guidelines would require States to develop emission regulations limiting air emissions
from each existing MWC unit located at an MWC facility that has an aggregate existing plant capacity to combust over
35 Mg/day of MSW, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994.
The proposed guidelines would apply to more than 99 percent of all existing MWC capacity. Additionally, plants with
an aggregate capacity to combust between 25 and 35 Mg/day would be required to submit an initial report of their location
and facility capacities, but would not be subject to any provisions of the guidelines. 


The aggregate design capacity of all existing MWC's at an MWC plant would be considered in determining: (1) Whether
a plant is subject to the guidelines; and (2) what control levels are applicable. The capacity of new MWC's (i.e., those
that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 20, 1994) that are located at the
MWC plant would not be considered in determining applicability of the emission guidelines to existing MWC's, but
would be considered in determining the applicability of the subpart Eb NSPS. Only MWC units constructed, modified,
or reconstructed on or before September 20, 1994 would be used for determining the applicability of subpart Cb guidelines.
Modification of an existing MWC to comply with the emission guidelines would not bring an existing MWC under the NSPS
for new MWC's.

An MWC is defined as any setting or equipment that combusts MSW. Municipal waste combustion includes the burning (or
pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of setting or equipment, including combustion equipment with and without heat recovery.
This definition has been slightly modified from the February 11, 1991 guidelines and is discussed below. 

Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream of household, commercial, and/or institutional
discards. This would include discards such as paper, wood, yard wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber,
glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials. The MSW definition includes household discards
as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but does not include industrial process or manufacturing
discards. The MSW definition also includes refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which is made from MSW that is shredded (or
pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. Municipal solid waste does not, however, include wastes that
are solely segregated medical wastes. However, if segregated medical wastes are mixed with MSW, the resulting mixture
is considered to be MSW, and the proposed guidelines would apply if the aggregate plant capacity exceeded 35 Mg/day.
Minor editing is proposed in the definition of MSW to clarify this point. 

Air curtain incinerators that combust MSW are MWC's. However, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes,
tree trimmings, and clean untreated lumber would be covered under a separate set of proposed opacity emission levels,
and no other part of the proposal would apply. Air curtain incinerator opacity requirements are discussed in section
VI of this preamble. 



B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 



Section 129 of the Act requires the EPA to establish numerical emission limits specifically for SO

2

, HCl, PM, opacity, Cd, Pb, Hg, dioxins/furans, CO, and NO

X

. Section 129 specifies that the EPA may also:

 


* * * promulgate numerical emission limitations or provide for the monitoring of post-combustion
concentrations of surrogate substances, parameters, or periods of residence times in excess of stated temperatures
with respect to pollutants other than those listed [above] * * *. 




Therefore, the EPA is proposing guidelines for load and flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet as additional
indicators of MWC operating practices. The EPA is also proposing a guideline emission level for fly ash/bottom ash
fugitive emissions because these emissions include Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans (see section V of this preamble
for further discussion of the EPA's decision to regulate fugitive emissions from MWC's). 



The February 11, 1991 guidelines include emission limitations for all of the pollutants listed above except Cd, Pb,
Hg, NO

X

, and fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions. The proposed guidelines would establish guidelines for all of the pollutants
listed above. The proposed guidelines for the same pollutants regulated by the February 11, 1991 guidelines (i.e.,
SO

2

, HCl, PM, opacity, dioxins/furans, CO, load, and flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet) have been revised
to reflect the requirements of section 129. 



C. Format for the Proposed Guidelines 



The format of the proposed emission guidelines is similar to the format of the February 11, 1991 guidelines. In most
cases, the format is in the form of an emission level (concentration). 


The format of the dioxin/furan guideline would be revised in today's proposal. In the 1991 guidelines, dioxin/furan
emissions were reported as a concentration (nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (ng/dscm), corrected to 7 percent
oxygen (O

2

), dry basis) on a total mass basis (i.e., the mass of all tetra- through octa-congeners were added together). In today's
proposal, dioxin/furan emissions could be reported in units of either ng/dscm total mass or ng/dscm toxic equivalency
(TEQ). Reporting in TEQ units is done by first measuring the total mass of dioxin/furan congeners and then adjusting
the results to account for the varying toxicity of each congener. The same test method (Method 23) is used in either
case. See section II.F of this preamble for further discussion of the proposed method of reporting dioxin/furan emissions
in terms of TEQ.

The February 11, 1991 guidelines specify guideline emission levels for PM and opacity. Particulate matter is measured
as a concentration (milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm)) and is corrected to 7 percent O

2

, and opacity is measured on a percentage basis. The format for the PM and opacity guidelines would not change, but Cd,
Pb, and Hg emission guideline limits would be added. Emissions of Cd, Pb, and Hg would be calculated as a concentration
(mg/dscm) corrected to 7 percent O

2

. For Hg, the proposed emission guidelines would also establish an alternative percentage reduction requirement.
A new method (Method 29) that would measure these pollutants is being proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

.
The February 11, 1991 guidelines establish control requirements for SO

2

 and HCl (MWC acid gases) by specifying both numerical emission levels, calculated as parts per million by volume (ppmv)
corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis, and percentage reduction requirements for both SO

2

 and HCl. Today's proposed guidelines would also be based on the same format.
Today's proposal would also establish a guideline emission level (ppmv) for NO

X

 emissions. The NO

X

 guideline emission level would apply to MWC units at MWC plants with capacities to combust greater than 225 Mg/day.
In addition to controlling stack emissions, the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines establish combustion operating
guidelines for MWC's. These operating guidelines are part of good combustion practices (GCP) and ensure that emissions
of MWC organics (dioxins/furans) are minimized on a continuous basis. The GCP requirements are included in today's
proposal, but they are being extended to apply to MWC's at plants of 35 Mg/day aggregate capacity or larger. Additionally,
some minor revisions are being proposed. The proposed revisions would include: (1) A requirement that all shift supervisors
and chief facility operators obtain full (as opposed to provisional) operator certification; (2) ``stand in'' authority
for MWC control room operators; and (3) required training of MWC shift supervisors. These items are discussed below.
The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines require provisional certification of the chief facility operator and
shift supervisors by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) or a State certification program. Development
of a site-specific training manual to be used for training other MWC personnel is also required. Today's proposal
would require that the chief facility operator and shift supervisor obtain both provisional and then full operator
certification.
Today's proposal would allow for the optional certification of one or more control room operators. Under the February
11, 1991 guidelines, all chief facility operators and shift supervisors must be certified, and one of these individuals
must be onsite during all periods of MWC operation. Under today's proposal, a provisionally certified control room
operator may ``stand in'' for the chief facility operator or shift supervisor during periods in which the certified
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is offsite, in order to fulfill the requirement that a certified
individual be on site during all periods of MWC operation. This would provide additional operating flexibility.
Today's proposal would also require that all chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators
complete the MWC training program developed by the EPA or a State program. The EPA has developed a model training program
that has been distributed to State air pollution control agencies, EPA Regional Offices, and MWC industry groups.
The EPA believes that operator training is an integral part of the implementation of GCP.
Today's proposed guidelines also establish guidelines for fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash handling
facilities. These guidelines would establish a no visible emissions level, and would apply to all buildings, external
ash transfer equipment, and ash handling areas at the MWC facility.


D. Proposed Emission Guidelines


Today's proposal would establish emission guidelines for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM, opacity,
Cd, Pb, and Hg), MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), and NO

X

. The guidelines also propose requirements for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive handling, MWC operating practices (CO,
load, and flue gas temperature), and operator training and certification.
The proposed guidelines would divide the MWC population into two subcategories: The first would be for MWC units located
at small MWC plants (i.e., those with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW but equal to or less
than 225 Mg/day), and the second would be for MWC units at large plants (i.e., those with aggregate capacities to combust
more than 225 Mg/day of MSW). The aggregate capacity of all existing MWC units at one site would be added together to
define aggregate MWC plant capacity for the purposes of the emission guidelines. The proposed emission guidelines
for each subcategory and subclass of MWC's are summarized in table 1.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed guideline limits are summarized below. 



1. Municipal Waste Combustor Organics 



The proposed guidelines would require existing MWC's at large MWC plants to meet a dioxin/furan emission level of
0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans, corrected to 7 percent O

2

. Existing MWC's located at small MWC plants would be required to meet a dioxin/furan level of 1.0 ng/dscm TEQ or 60 ng/dscm
total dioxins/furans, corrected to 7 percent O

2

. The TEQ emission levels would be calculated using the 1989 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) international
toxic equivalency factors (TEF's), using the methods described in section II.F of this preamble and section 60.58b
of subpart Eb of today's proposed NSPS. 



2. Municipal Waste Combustor Metals 



The proposed emission guidelines would require MWC's at large plants to control PM to a level of 27 mg/dscm corrected
to 7 percent O

2

. The emission guideline PM level proposed for MWC's at small plants is 69 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O

2

. Municipal waste combustors at both small and large existing MWC plants would be required to meet an opacity level
of 10 percent using a 6-minute averaging period. 

The proposed emission guidelines would also establish specific emission levels for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed guidelines
would require existing MWC's at large plants to meet a Cd emission level of 0.040 mg/dscm, a Pb emission level of 0.50
mg/dscm, and an Hg emission level of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. 

For existing MWC's at small plants, the emission guidelines would be 0.10 mg/dscm for Cd, 1.6 mg/dscm for Pb, and 0.080
mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. 



3. Municipal Waste Combustor Acid Gases 



The proposed emission guidelines for acid gases would require all existing MWC's located at large plants to control
SO

2

 emissions to a level of either 35 ppmv or 75-percent reduction (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour geometric mean basis and HCl emissions to a level of either 35 ppmv or 95-percent reduction
(at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis). All existing MWC's located at small plants would be required to meet an SO

2

 emission level of either 80 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour geometric mean basis and an HCl emission level of either 250 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (at
7 percent O

2

, dry basis). 



4. Good Combustion Practices 



Today's proposed emission guidelines would require all existing MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day
to comply with specified operating practices that reflect GCP. These operating practices include CO levels, combustor
load levels, and flue gas temperatures and are specified below.

The GCP levels remain unchanged from the February 11, 1991 guidelines. For modular starved-air and modular excess-air
types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 50 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn waterwall, mass burn fixed-wall refractory, and fluidized-bed
types of MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary refractory MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 100
ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For mass burn rotary waterwall MWC's, the CO emission limit would be 250
ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For RDF-stoker MWC's, the CO limit would be 200 ppmv (at 7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 24-hour block average basis. For coal/RDF mixed fuel-fired MWC's, the CO limit would be 150 ppmv (at
7 percent O

2

, dry basis) on a 4-hour block average basis. 

Municipal waste combustors would be allowed to operate up to 110 percent of the maximum capacity, as achieved during
the most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Maximum capacity would be based on the steam flow rate, which would
be continuously monitored according to the ASME Power Test Code (PTC) for Steam Generating Units (PTC4.1 and PTC19.5).
This requirement is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines. The EPA requests comments on this method
of measuring load for steam-generating MWC's. Specifically, the EPA has questions regarding the requirement for
calibration of the measuring device (e.g., orifice plate) before and after each dioxin/furan compliance test. The
EPA is concerned that this calibration requirement may be overly burdensome because the main steam line that contains
the orifice plate may need to be cut in order to access the orifice plate for recalibration. Also, the EPA requests comments
on whether the ASME PTC adequately addresses the need for calibrating the signal from the flow meter. 

Additionally, the EPA requests comments on the use of boiler feed water flow as an alternative method for continuously
monitoring load for steam-generating MWC's. 

Furthermore, the EPA is considering allowing the use of the continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate to measure maximum
capacity for both steam-generating MWC's, as well as those MWC's that do not generate steam. These types of monitors
are based on ultrasonic, thermal, or differential pressure methods, and are now being required as part of the EPA's
Acid Rain Program (40 CFR part 75). The EPA requests comments on whether continuous flue gas volumetric flow rate monitors
are adequately demonstrated and accurate methods for determining compliance with the load level requirements,
and if they should be allowed as an alternative to the use of the ASME PTC. 

Under the guidelines, MWC's would establish a site-specific maximum flue gas temperature at the final PM control
device inlet demonstrated during their most recent dioxin/furan compliance test. Similar to the provisions for
establishing a maximum load level measurement, the maximum demonstrated PM control device inlet temperature is
established as the maximum 4-hour block average temperature measured during the most recent dioxin/furan compliance
test. The MWC must then be operated so that the temperature at the final PM control device inlet does not exceed this
level by more than 17 
 C (30 
 F) (4-hour block average basis). 



5. Operator Certification and Training 



The proposed emission guidelines would require full certification of all MWC shift supervisors and MWC chief facility
operators by the ASME or a State program. The proposed guidelines would also require that at least one of the following
persons be on duty at the MWC at all times during which the MWC is combusting waste: A fully certified MWC chief facility
operator, a fully certified shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified control room operator. A provisionally
certified control room operator would be allowed to ``stand in'' during times that a fully certified chief facility
operator or shift supervisor is offsite. 

In addition, the proposed emission guidelines would require each owner or operator of an MWC with an aggregate capacity
greater than 35 Mg/day to develop and maintain a site-specific training manual and to review it with all employees
associated with the operation of the MWC (including MWC maintenance personnel, crane/load operators, and ash handlers).
The manual and training would be updated annually. 

Section 129 of the Act of 1990 requires the EPA to develop and promote a model State program for the training and certification
of MWC operators. Section 129 specifies that ``any person with control over processes affecting emissions from a
unit'' must successfully complete an acceptable training program. Consistent with section 129, today's proposed
emission guidelines would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators
at MWC plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to complete the MWC operator training course developed by the EPA or a
State program. The EPA has developed a model training program and has distributed it to State air pollution control
agencies, EPA regional offices, and MWC industry groups. This model training program could be used to fulfill this
requirement and prepare for the ASME certification. 



6. Nitrogen Oxides Emissions 



The proposed emission guidelines would require MWC's at large plants, except refractory MWC's, to control NO

X

 emissions to a level of 180 ppmv (corrected to 7 percent O

2

, dry basis, on a 24-hour daily average basis). A ``no control'' NO

X

 emission guideline level for MWC's at small plants and refractory MWC's at large plants is proposed and discussed
in section VIII of this preamble.

7. Fly Ash or Bottom Ash Fugitive Emissions 


The proposed guidelines for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive dust emissions would establish a guideline of no visible
emissions for fly ash or bottom ash emissions from an MWC facility. 
The visible emissions guidelines would apply to buildings and external ash handling or transfer activities (e.g.,
loading), and any other area at the designated facility that is a potential source of fly ash or bottom ash fugitive
emissions. 


E. Comparison of the 1991 Guidelines and Today's Proposal 


The subpart Ca emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 and today's proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines
both contain guideline emission levels for dioxins/furans, PM, SO

2

, and HCl at large MWC's; however, today's proposed guidelines for most of these pollutants are more stringent than
the guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991. The February 11, 1991 guidelines did not address Cd, Pb, Hg, NO

X

, or fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions, but each of these is included in today's proposal. Also, today's proposal
covers all MWC units at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day, whereas the February 11, 1991 guidelines
only covered MWC units with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day. A comparison of the 1991 guidelines and proposed guideline
emission levels is provided in table 2.

The MWC operating guidelines (GCP) included in today's proposal are the same as those in the February 11, 1991 guidelines.
The training and certification requirements have changed somewhat. The February 11, 1991 guidelines required only
provisional certification of MWC chief facility operators and shift supervisors, but today's proposed guidelines
would require both provisional and then full certification. This change is being proposed because the full operator
certification program is now widely available. In 1991, the program was not widely available. 

Today's proposal also adds a provision to allow provisionally certified MWC control room operators to stand in for
the MWC chief facility operators or shift supervisors in their temporary absence from the MWC. Additionally, today's
proposal would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators to complete
the EPA or a State MWC training course. This training course requirement was not included in the February 11, 1991 guidelines.




F. Performance Testing and Monitoring Requirements 



Information related to the performance testing and monitoring requirements for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), PM, and MWC operating practices was published in the February 11 and 13,
1991 

Federal Register

 notices (56 FR 5514 and 56 FR 5758). These same requirements would be adopted by today's proposed guidelines and would
be extended to apply to all MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day. Because the proposed guidelines
allow compliance with either a dioxin/furan limit in terms of TEQ or a dioxin/furan limit on a total mass basis, procedures
are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. The mass of each tetra- through octa- chlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method 23. Each congener mass would
then be adjusted by the corresponding toxic equivalency factor (TEF; the 1989 NATO international TEF's). Finally,
the adjusted congener masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in ng/dscm TEQ. Furthermore, today's
proposal would require both large and small MWC facilities to conduct annual opacity tests using EPA Reference Method
9. This testing would be in addition to the continuous monitoring of opacity levels. Also, today's proposal allows
small MWC facilities to conduct less frequent testing for dioxin/furan, HCl, and PM emissions if the small facility
consistently demonstrates compliance. More specifically, under today's proposed emission guidelines, if three
consecutive annual compliance tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate compliance with the emission guideline
for a pollutant (i.e., PM, HCl, or dioxins/furans), the MWC would be allowed to wait 3 years before retesting for the
pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year shows compliance with the emission guideline for that pollutant,
then the facility could again wait 3 years to test for the pollutant. If noncompliance with the emission guideline
for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required to be undertaken and annual testing would be required
to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with the emission guideline is established. At a minimum,
performance tests for dioxins/furans, HCl, and PM would be required to be performed for each MWC at a small MWC plant
every 3 years. This provision is included to minimize costs for small MWC plants, while still retaining periodic testing
to ensure compliance. All large MWC plants would continue to be required to conduct annual compliance tests.

Annual performance tests to determine compliance with the Cd, Pb, and Hg emission guidelines would be based on EPA
Reference Method 29. The average emission rates of three or more test runs using this methodology would be used to determine
compliance. The EPA considered the use of EPA Reference Method 101A for Hg testing; however, based on available data,
the EPA has concluded that Method 29 is a better measure of Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions than Method 101A and has therefore
proposed Method 29 for testing MWC's. Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate
compliance with the Cd, Pb, and Hg emission guidelines for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing
for these three pollutants every third year. 

The EPA Reference Method 29 is proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

. Method 29 is very similar to the method that has been used by the EPA's Office of Solid Waste to measure metal emissions
from boilers cofiring hazardous waste, commonly referred to as the EPA multimetals method. The proposed Method 29
is discussed in section IV.H of this preamble.

The proposed emission guidelines for NO

X

 would require continuous monitoring of NO

X

 emissions for MWC's at large plants, except refractory units for which a ``no control'' emission guideline is proposed.
Compliance with the NO

X

 emission guideline level for nonrefractory MWC's at large plants would be determined by calculating the arithmetic
average of the hourly emission rates, as measured by the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), for a 24-hour
period that the MWC operates, using EPA Reference Method 19. Quality assurance would be maintained in accordance
with appendix F of 40 CFR part 60. 

Annual performance tests to determine compliance with proposed fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions guidelines
would be based on EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous visual observation). The limits would apply at all times,
and tests would be conducted during periods of time when fly ash/bottom ash is transferred from the combustor or from
the air pollution control device to the ash loading area, and when ash is loaded for transportation or is being transported
onsite. 

The data availability requirement for CEMS (SO

2

, NO

X

, CO, and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) has been changed from the 1991 NSPS.

<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00078 </DOCNO>

Today's proposal would require that valid paired CEMS hourly averages (i.e., SO

2 

and O

2 

(or CO

2

), NO

X 

 and O

2 

(or CO

2

), and CO and O

2 

(or CO

2

)) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the designated
facility is operated and combusting MSW. 


G. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Compliance Schedule Guidelines 


The MWC emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 for MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day established
reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC acid
gases (SO

2

 and HCl), and operating practices (CO, load, flue gas temperature, and operator training/certification). These
reporting and recordkeeping requirements are discussed in the February 11, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5514). These same reporting and recordkeeping requirements would be adopted under the proposed guidelines,
except that dioxin/furan emissions would be recorded and reported on either a total mass basis or a TEQ basis. Furthermore,
if small MWC's meet the criteria in today's proposal allowing them to conduct performance tests for dioxins/furans,
HCl, and PM every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for years in which a full compliance test
was not required. 
Today's proposal also would add reporting and recordkeeping requirements for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

X

. The proposed emission guidelines would require that initial and annual compliance reports be submitted for Cd,
Pb, and Hg for MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. If small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct
performance tests for Cd, Pb, or Hg every third year, they would be allowed to submit a simplified annual report for
years when a full compliance test was not required. The proposed guidelines would also require that the amount of activated
carbon injected for Hg control at small and large plants be recorded during MWC operation. 
The NSPS for MWC's promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488) establishes reporting and recordkeeping requirements
for NO

X 

for new MWC's; however, no NO

X

 requirements were established for existing MWC's. These NSPS reporting and recordkeeping requirements would now
apply to MWC's only at large plants under today's proposed emission guidelines. Submittal of initial and quarterly
reports for all CEMS data and accuracy determinations for NO

X

 emissions would be required. Quality assurance would be required in accordance with appendix F in 40 CFR part 60. 
Initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions testing would be required under today's
proposal for both small and large plants. 
The proposed emission guidelines include revised compliance scheduling requirements. The proposed guidelines
require State plans to require both small and large MWC plants to meet one of the following two compliance schedules:
(1) Full compliance with the State plan within 1 year after approval of the State plan, or (2) full compliance with the
State plan within 3 years following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification
is required, or within 3 years following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required, provided
the State plan includes measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress toward compliance with the State
plan (see section IV.I of this preamble for further discussion of this requirement). 
The proposed emission guidelines also include an accelerated compliance schedule for compliance with the proposed
dioxin/furan and Hg emission limits for certain MWC's. Under the accelerated schedule, MWC units for which construction
commenced after June 26, 1987 and that are located at large MWC plants would be required to be in compliance with the
proposed dioxin/furan and Hg emission guidelines within 1 year following issuance of a revised construction or operation
permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 1 year following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification
is not required (these units are already equipped with acid gas/PM control systems). The rationale for requiring
this accelerated schedule is provided in section IV.I of this preamble. 
Additionally, the proposal requires compliance with both the operator training and certification requirements
by 1 year after the date of promulgation of the emission guidelines. 
Records of all data, including results of emission tests and compliance reports would be maintained for 5 years following
the date of submission of the data. 


III. Impacts of the Proposed Emission Guidelines 


This section describes the impacts (i.e., air, water, solid waste, energy, control cost, and economic impacts) of
the proposed emission guidelines for small and large MWC facilities. The impacts are summarized in table 3. Table
3 presents: (1) The impact of these proposed subpart Cb guidelines over a pre-1989 baseline (i.e., baseline prior
to the effective date of the subpart Ca guidelines); and (2) the incremental impact of these proposed subpart Cb guidelines
over the subpart Ca guidelines. The following discussion focuses only on the impacts of today's proposal based on
a pre-1989 baseline, since the emission guidelines promulgated in 1991 have not been implemented. For further information
on the impacts of the proposed emission guidelines, refer to the document entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for
Proposed Emission Standards and Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors'' that is included in the list of items
under 

Supplementary Information 

at the beginning of this preamble.

A. Air Impacts 


The air emission reductions discussed below, as well as all other impacts discussed in today's proposal, are nationwide
impacts that would result from full implementation of the guidelines and are relative to the current baseline MWC
population, considering in-place air pollution control devices. These are not incremental impacts relative to
the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines. The total impacts are presented because the February 11, 1991 guidelines
have not been implemented and are being significantly altered by today's proposal. 
Under today's proposed emission guidelines, nationwide emissions of total dioxins/furans would be reduced by about
157 kilograms per year (kg/yr) compared with emissions in the absence of nationwide guidelines. Emissions of dioxins/furans
on a TEQ basis would be reduced by about 2,620 grams per year (g/yr). This represents a nationwide reduction of about
99 percent compared to baseline levels in the absence of the guidelines. Remaining nationwide dioxin/furan emissions
would be about 42 g/yr TEQ. 
Nationwide emissions of PM would be decreased by about 3,100 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) compared with levels in the
absence of emission guidelines. This represents a reduction of just under 50 percent compared to baseline levels
in the absence of nationwide guidelines. In combination with baseline control, this would represent greater than
99-percent PM control. Emissions of Cd would be reduced by about 6 Mg/yr, Pb would be reduced by about 91 Mg/yr, and Hg
would be reduced by about 48 Mg/yr. These emission reductions represent decreases of about 70 to 80 percent for each
of these three metals. In combination with baseline control, this would represent greater than 99-percent control
for Cd and Pb and greater than 80-percent control for Hg. 
Nationwide emissions of SO

2

 and HCl would be decreased by 43,000 Mg/yr and 56,000 Mg/yr, respectively, relative to current baseline levels. This
represents about 87-percent control of acid gases compared to baseline levels in the absence of emission guidelines.
In combination with baseline control, this would represent about 95-percent control of these acid gases. 
The proposed emission guidelines would reduce nationwide emissions of NO

X

 by 19,000 Mg/yr, representing an overall nationwide emission reduction of over 30 percent compared to baseline levels
that would be emitted without the proposed guidelines. 


B. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 


Water and solid waste impacts that would result from today's proposal were determined not to be significant. No water
pollution impacts are projected because the control technologies considered would not produce a wastewater stream.

The EPA believes that MWC ash disposal is adequately addressed by current waste management standards, so that considerations
of ash quality need not play a role in this rulemaking. 


C. Energy Impacts 


The energy impacts of applying add-on pollutant emission controls required as part of today's proposal would not
result in significant energy impacts. Today's proposal for MWC acid gases, MWC organics, MWC metals, and NO

X

 would affect an estimated 179 MWC plants and would result in energy requirements of 400 to 500 gigawatt-hours per year
(GW-hr/yr) of electricity to operate the air pollution control devices, and about 780 terajoules per year (TJ/yr)
of natural gas to maintain combustor operating conditions that reflect GCP. 
Most of the MWC's that would be affected by the proposed guidelines generate electricity for sale. For example, a large
mass burn/waterwall MWC plant would generate about 500 GW-hr/yr of electricity. The energy to operate its air pollution
control equipment would represent only about 4 percent of generation. Additionally, natural gas that is fired for
GCP requirements represents less than 0.2 percent of the annual heat input to MWC's. Considering that a large percentage
of new power plant capacity to be constructed in the next 10 years will fire natural gas, the firing of small amounts
of natural gas for GCP (while generating electricity) actually reallocates natural gas use rather than just increasing
consumption.


D. Cost and Economic Impacts 
1. National Overview 


The EPA projects that about 33 million Mg of MSW will be combusted in the year 2000 in existing MWC plants subject to the
guidelines being proposed today. The EPA estimates that there would be 179 existing MWC plants in operation that would
be subject to the subpart Cb guidelines: 60 in the 35- to 225-Mg/day capacity range and 119 in the larger than 225-Mg/day
capacity range. The typical plant has two or three MWC units. 
The cost estimates given below are in 1990 dollars and are for emission control and compliance testing. The estimates
do not include costs for such things as permitting and enforcement. To estimate the costs of the guidelines being proposed
today, the EPA has taken into account all existing control equipment. Cost estimates are incremental over costs associated
with the control equipment in current use and include retrofit premiums. Cost estimates are total costs for the revised
MWC guidelines and are not incremental to the February 11, 1991 guidelines. 
The nationwide annual cost of the guidelines including testing, reporting, and recordkeeping for acid gas, PM, Hg,
and NO

X

 control would be about $445 million. The national average annual cost of the guidelines per unit of MSW combusted would
be about $14/Mg. 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The above costs for the guidelines are overall national costs spread over the entire existing MWC population. However,
about one half of the affected waste flow from existing MWC's larger than 225 Mg/day already is combusted in facilities
equipped with spray dryer/electrostatic precipitator (SD/ESP) or spray dryer/fabric filter (SD/FF) systems,
and these MWC's would incur only a minor compliance cost (about $3/Mg) as a result of the proposed guidelines. The average
annual cost of acid gas, PM, and Hg control per unit of MSW combusted at large plants that do not already have SD/ESP or
SD/FF systems would be about $20/Mg. 
The average annual cost per unit of MSW combusted at small plants using dry sorbent injection/electrostatic precipitator
(DSI/ESP) systems and Hg control would be about $36/Mg. 
The guidelines will have a wide range of impacts on the price of combustion services. To study these potential impacts,
the EPA first applied a cost accounting procedure that approximates the one that would be used by an individual publicly
owned MWC. Then, using a 1993 average tipping fee of $57/Mg of MSW combusted (1990 dollars) of waste combusted and assuming
the full cost of meeting acid gas, PM, Hg, and NO

X

 requirements is passed directly to MWC customers, the EPA found that the lowest and highest tipping fee increases
for the model plants used in the EPA's economic analysis would be $9 and $56, respectively, per megagram of MSW combusted.
The majority of tipping fee increases would be in the $17 to $28/Mg range. (These estimates apply only to MWC's at small
plants that do not already have DSI/ESP, SD/ESP, or SD/FF systems or large plants that do not currently have SD/ESP
or SD/FF systems.)
The EPA projects that, regardless of how the regulatory costs are financed, most of the burden will find its way directly
or indirectly to households served by MWC's. Costs that are directly assessed to households are likely to be in the
form of increased collection fees and/or increased taxes. Indirect household costs are price increases charged
by businesses that similarly are faced with increases in collection fees and/or taxes. For the guidelines being proposed
today, the EPA projects an increase in the average annual household cost of waste disposal of about $25 for communities
that have MWC's. The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions, including the extent to which recycling
and landfilling are also used within the affected community. Approximately 62 percent of the total average household
cost is a direct cost, thus the annual direct household cost would be approximately $15. The EPA estimates that the
average annual household cost breaks down to $26 per year for communities over 250,000 in population; $24 for communities
with populations between 100,000 and 250,000; $24 for communities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000;
and $22 for communities with populations under 50,000. This range represents less than 1 percent of household income.
The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions. 
The EPA identified 39 private firms each of which owns one or more MWC's. Detailed financial data are published for
only 17 of the firms projected to incur costs, none of which is small (under $6 million in annual sales). (Firms for which
annual sales data are not available are assumed to be small.) The total annual cost of the guidelines as a percentage
of sales averages less than 1 percent and ranges from less than 1 percent to about 80 percent for these 17 firms. Potential
tipping fee increases, based on an assumed full cost pass-through (i.e., passing all control costs to consumers via
the tipping fee) and an average tipping fee of $57/Mg, are about 18 percent for MWC's owned by small firms and about 14
percent for MWC's owned by large firms. 
Some of the benefits of the emission guidelines have been quantified. The absence of sufficient exposure-response
and valuation information precludes a comprehensive benefits analysis for many of the MWC pollutants. The EPA expects
partial benefits for reduction of PM and SO

2

, including benefits from reductions in morbidity and mortality, to total about $106 million annually. The total
benefits would be higher if benefits from reductions of other pollutants were valuated. In addition, recent evidence
suggests the mortality reduction benefits of particulate mater controls may be higher than is assumed in this analysis.



2. Control Costs for Typical MWC Plants 


The previous section presented costs of the proposal on a national basis. This section presents examples of typical
retrofit costs that would be experienced at both a large MWC plant and a small MWC plant. These are typical costs. Lower
costs will be experienced at MWC plants that have already installed the air pollution control components required
by the proposal. Higher costs will be experienced for MWC plants with more difficult retrofit applications. 
The costing data presented in this section are provided in the following formats: capital cost, annualized cost,
and cost per Mg of municipal waste combusted. The costing information is subcategorized by air pollution control
components (i.e., GCP upgrade, acid gas scrubber, activated carbon injection application, and NO

X

 control). For perspective, the estimated cost of combustion units is also displayed. Since the actual MWC unit cost
for an existing combustion unit is sensitive to past funding practices, the EPA could not provide this cost. Instead,
the EPA has provided the cost of combustion units for a new MWC plant for reference. This costing information has been
derived from 1989 background information documents that were used in developing the 1991 NSPS and emission guidelines
(see 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 for more information about these documents), and is presented in 1987 dollars (the escalation factor for converting
to mid-1990 dollars is 1.111). 
From table 3A, it can be noted that the capital cost for retrofit at a large existing MWC plant (980 Mg/day capacity)
would be about $16.8 million of which 

$13.6 million would be for the acid gas control, 2.9 million for NO

X

 control, and less than one million for activated carbon injection and GCP. On an annualized basis, the cost would be
about $5.1 million/yr or about $16/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about
$60/Mg combusted (based on the baseline combustor cost for a new large MWC plant presented in table 3B) to about $76/Mg
combusted. Large MWC plants represent about 94 percent of the existing MWC combustion capacity.

For a small existing MWC plant (135 Mg/day capacity), table 3A shows a capital cost for retrofit of about $2.6 million
of which $2.5 million would be for the acid gas control system and the remaining for activated carbon injection and
GCP. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about $770,000/yr or about $17/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase
baseline combustor cost from about $61/Mg combusted (based on the baseline combustor cost for a new small MWC plant
presented in table 3B) to about $78/Mg combusted. Small MWC plants represent about 6 percent of the existing MWC combustion
capacity. 

IV. Rationale for the Proposed Guidelines for MWC Emissions 


This section addresses the legal, technical, and economic basis for the proposed emission guidelines. The basis
for regulating MWC's, for regulating the specified pollutants, and for regulating MWC's according to the specified
size categories are discussed. The section also presents the EPA's approach in establishing the MACT floor and selecting
MACT. Additionally, the section discusses the selected format of the proposed guidelines, the proposed performance
testing and monitoring requirements, and the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 


A. Background 


On November 15, 1990, the Act was amended. The Act of 1990 includes a new section 129 that applies to a range of solid waste
incinerators including MWC's, medical waste incinerators (MWI's), infectious waste incinerators, and industrial
waste incinerators. 
Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA was directed to promulgate MACT-based guidelines
for MWC's. However, section 129 also includes a clause directing the EPA to issue emission guidelines based on BDT
under the terms imposed in the consent decree issued from 

State of New York et al.

 v. 

Reilly

 (No. 89-1729 D.D.C.), but limiting applicability of those emission guidelines to MWC's with unit capacities
greater than 225 Mg/day. Emission guidelines that were signed by the Administrator on January 11, 1991 and published
in the 

Federal Register

 on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514) complied with this component of the section 129 requirements. 
Regarding the MACT-based guidelines, section 129 directs the EPA to promulgate MACT-based guidelines for MWC units
located at plants with capacities greater than 225 Mg/day and at plants with capacities less than 225 Mg/day. The MACT-based
guidelines are to include numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

X

, and are to address operator training requirements. 
Today's proposal complies with all requirements of section 129 described above. This has been done by: (1) Proposing
MACT-based guidelines that cover MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day; (2) proposing numerical emission
limits for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

X

; (3) proposing operator training requirements; and (4) proposing opacity limits for air curtain incinerators firing
specific ``clean'' fuels. 
The subpart Eb NSPS that is proposed in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

 would apply to new facilities constructed after September 20, 1994. However, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS
will remain in effect. Therefore, those existing facilities subject to the February 11, 1991 NSPS that were constructed
on or prior to September 20, 1994 would be subject to both the subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines.

B. Selection of Source Category 


The MWC guidelines adopted on February 11, 1991 provided the rationale for the selection of MWC's as a source category
to be regulated (56 FR 5514). Moreover, section 129 of the Act directs the EPA to issue guidelines for this source category,
and thereby confirms the EPA's earlier decision.
Today's proposed emission guidelines (subpart Cb) would apply to existing MWC's, defined as those MWC's for which
construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994. Municipal waste combustors
for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994 would be covered by
the subpart Eb NSPS proposed in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. 
Also, as required by section 129 of the Act, today's proposed guidelines would establish opacity limits for certain
existing air curtain incinerators, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before
September 20, 1994. Under the proposed guidelines, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings,
and clean untreated lumber would be required to meet an opacity limit, and no other requirements would apply. The proposed
guidelines for these air curtain incinerators are presented in section VI of this preamble. 


C. Modification or Reconstruction of Existing MWC's 


The subpart Ea NSPS proposal published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided a discussion of the terms and conditions associated with construction,
modification, and reconstruction for MWC's. One change is being proposed. Previously, the terms ``modification''
and ``reconstruction'' were defined under sections 60.14 and 60.15 of subpart A of part 60. Section 129 of the Act has
specified a new definition of ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' that combines and revises the previous
definitions of ``modification'' and ``reconstruction.'' Specifically, ``modified solid waste incineration
unit'' refers to: (1) Modifications for which the



* * * cumulative costs of the modifications, over the life of the unit, exceed 50 per centum of the original
cost of the construction and installation of the unit (not including the cost of any land purchased in connection with
such construction or installation) updated to current costs. * * *



or (2) modifications involving



* * * a physical change in or change in the method of operation of the unit which increases the amount
of any air pollutant emitted by the unit for which standards have been established under [section 129] or section 111
* * *.


D. Selection of Designated Pollutants 


A complete discussion of the rationale for selecting ``MWC emissions'' as the designated pollutants under sections
111(b) and 111(d) of the Act is provided in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the 1991 emission guidelines
(54 FR 52209). Additionally, section 129 of the Act specifies that emission guidelines be developed for PM, opacity,
SO

2

, HCl, NO

X

, CO, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans. Emission guidelines for all but four of these pollutants (Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

X

) were established in the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines (56 FR 5514). Section 129 specifies that emission
limits be set for each of the metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg). 
Emission guidelines for fugitive MWC fly ash/bottom ash emissions are proposed today because these emissions also
contain PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans. 


E. Selection of Designated Facilities 


For the proposed emission guidelines, the designated facility, an MWC unit, is defined as any setting or equipment
chamber or pit used to burn MSW (including RDF) and extends to and includes MWC fly ash/bottom ash emission points,
including ash storage areas, conveyor transfer points, and ash loading areas for hauling trucks at the MWC site. This
does not extend to ash handling outside of the MWC property boundary or at ash fill sites.
Municipal waste combustion includes the burning (or pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of equipment, chamber, or pit including
equipment with and without heat recovery. Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream
of household, commercial, and/or institutional discards. This would include discards such as paper, wood, yard
wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber, glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials.
The MSW definition includes household discards as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but
does not include industrial process or manufacturing discards. The MSW definition also includes RDF, which is a type
of MSW that is shredded (or pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. Municipal solid waste does not include
wastes that are solely segregated medical wastes. However, any mixtures of medical waste with nonmedical hospital
waste or with household, commercial, or institutional waste is considered to be MSW. Minor editing has been done to
the definition of MSW to clarify this point. 
Cofired combustors are those that fire MSW with non-MSW fuel such as coal. Cofired combustors that combust a fuel feed
stream comprised, in aggregate, of equal to or less than 30 percent MSW or RDF (by weight, based on a 24-hour average),
would not be subject to the emission guidelines and would be required only to submit reports of the amount of MSW and
other fuels combusted. The exclusion of cofired combustors from the guidelines is consistent with the Act of 1990.
This exclusion is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 guidelines. 
Waste-fuel power generation facilities that combust a single-item waste stream of tires, fuel derived solely from
tires, or used oil would be subject only to an initial report and to no other provisions in today's proposal or to the
emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514). This exclusion is unchanged from the
February 11, 1991 guidelines. 
Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW are subject to the proposal;
however, air curtain incinerators that combust only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber (these
are a subset of MSW) would be subject to an opacity standard and its associated testing, recordkeeping, and reporting
included in today's proposal, but would not be subject to other parts of today's proposal. This exclusion does not
apply to air curtain incinerators that combust other MSW materials.

Today's proposed guidelines for MWC's would apply to MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. The lower
size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity for controlling MWC emissions under the proposed emission guidelines
was selected after reviewing the population distributions of MWI's and MWC's. Most incinerators at medical waste
facilities are smaller incinerators that fire segregated medical waste with general hospital discards (MSW), and
these incinerators would have the potential to be covered by today's proposal. The population distribution of MWI's
is distinctly different from the population distribution of traditional MWC plants that are the target of today's
proposal. The existing distribution of MWC's is composed of about 372 units (about 179 plants), with an average plant
size of about 600 Mg/day combustion capacity, with two or three MWC units at each plant. The potential nationwide combustion
capacity of existing MWC's is about 107,000 Mg/day, assuming continuous operation. The MWI distribution is quite
different and includes about 7,000 combustors with a single combustion unit per facility and an average unit size
of less than 3 Mg/day combustion capacity. The total U.S. capacity of MWI's is about 20,000 Mg/day. This population
is being addressed under a separate rulemaking. Clearly, the MWC population represents a smaller number of comparatively
larger units, and MWI's represent a much larger number of smaller units. The lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate
plant capacity that is included in today's proposed emission guidelines would exclude less than 1 percent of the total
nationwide combustion capacity of MWC's and would result in over 99 percent of total MWC capacity being covered by
this proposal. The same lower size cutoff would prevent significant dual coverage under this proposal by excluding
more than 99 percent of MWI units and about 97 percent of nationwide MWI capacity from today's proposed revisions.


As mentioned above, the proposed emission guidelines with a 35 Mg/day cutoff would cover the great majority of MWC's,
and may also cover a few of the largest MWI's (nine units at three sites are known to cofire medical waste with MSW and
are above the 35 Mg/day of MSW total plant capacity cutoff). Section 129 of the Act requires that regulations for MWI's
be developed in a separate rulemaking. For these reasons, it is appropriate that today's proposed guidelines focus
on MWC's and that a separate regulation focus on MWI's. The NSPS and guidelines for MWI's are scheduled to be proposed
in 1995. 

Municipal waste combustor plants with aggregate capacities below 35 Mg/day would not be subject to the emission limits
under today's proposed emission guidelines. However, those facilities with aggregate plant capacities between
25 and 35 Mg/day would be required to report (one time) their location, startup date, and aggregate plant capacity.
They would also be required to provide supporting information, including calculations used to determine plant capacity.
This one-time report would allow the EPA or State agency to enforce the lower size cutoff for applicability to the proposed
guidelines. Plants with aggregate capacities of 25 Mg/day or below would not be subject to any provisions under this
proposal. 

The proposed emission guidelines for MWC's are subdivided into two subcategories of air emissions requirements:
The first for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust more than 35 Mg/day but less than or equal
to 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as small MWC plants), and the second for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate
capacities to combust greater than 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as large MWC plants). The 225 Mg/day dividing point
was established because this size break represents a transition point between field-erected waterwall MWC's and
modular MWC's. 

In the subcategory of existing plants with capacities greater than 225 Mg/day, there are about 119 MWC plants with
235 MWC units. In the subcategory of existing plants with capacities greater than 35 Mg/day but equal to or less than
225 Mg/day, there are about 60 plants with 137 units. The large plant subcategory accounts for about 94 percent of the
total combustion capacity whereas the smaller subcategory accounts for about 5 percent of total capacity. 



F. Selection of Maximum Achievable Control Technology 



The following discussion addresses the EPA's selection of MACT. The existing technologies for controlling emissions
of the designated pollutants from MWC's are reviewed, followed by a summary of the EPA's approach for establishing
the MACT floor. Finally, the discussion presents the EPA's selection of MACT for MWC's at small and large MWC plants.




1. Summary of MWC Control Technologies 



The following discussion reviews the existing technologies for controlling emissions of acid gases, dioxins/furans,
PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO

x

 from MWC's. 

a. 

Acid Gas/PM Control Technologies.

 Municipal waste combustor acid gas/PM control is a general term that refers to a group of MWC air pollution control
technology combinations. These combinations control a wide range of pollutants, such as acid gases (including SO

2

 and HCl), organics (including dioxins/furans), and PM and metals (including Cd, Pb, and a number of other metals except
Hg). The three acid gas/PM controls most commonly used in the United States for existing MWC's are: (1) GCP plus DSI
followed by an ESP; (2) GCP plus an SD followed by an ESP; and (3) GCP plus an SD followed by an FF. Discussions of each of
these control systems were presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the acid gas and PM emission guidelines
in subpart Ca (54 FR 52209). Control of Cd, Pb, and Hg were not discussed in detail in the 1989 preamble. 

Since 1991, the performance of the acid gas/PM control systems for removal of Cd, Pb, and Hg has been investigated in
more depth. Cadmium and Pb are both volatile at temperatures present in combustion systems, but condense onto PM in
the flue gas at temperatures associated with the operation of most PM control systems. As a result, the control of Cd
and Pb is generally related to the control of PM emissions. Much of the PM in the flue gas from an MWC is fine PM; from 20
to 70 percent of the PM in the flue gas from an MWC has an aerodynamic diameter of less than 1 micrometer (1 micron). Because
of the potential for adsorption of Cd and Pb onto fine PM that is less readily collected by control devices than larger
PM, the control of fine PM is especially important in controlling these metals.

<TEXT>
 

Both FF-equipped systems (i.e., DSI/FF's and SD/FF's) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP)-equipped systems
(e.g., ESP's, DSI/ESP's, and SD/ESP's) can achieve efficient control of PM, and the efficiency of total PM and fine
PM control achieved by these systems depends on their design. However, FF-equipped systems are generally more effective
in capturing fine PM than ESP-equipped systems. Therefore, the control of Cd and Pb achieved by FF-equipped systems
is typically better than that of ESP-equipped systems. 

For DSI/FF and SD/FF systems, data for controlled Cd emissions range from 0.001 to 0.0100 mg/dscm. Emissions of Pb
from MWC's with these systems are less than 0.10 mg/dscm. For SD/ESP systems, the data for Cd and Pb emissions are variable,
showing emission levels from 0.005 to 0.040 mg/dscm for Cd, and levels of less than 0.10 to 0.50 mg/dscm for Pb. For DSI/ESP
and ESP-only systems, there is no indication of a difference in the level of Cd and Pb control between these control
systems. For both of these systems, Cd emission levels range up to 0.10 mg/dscm, and Pb emission levels range up to 1.6
mg/dscm. 

Although the above combinations of acid gas/PM controls are effective at removing Cd, Pb, and other metals, they do
not consistently remove Hg without integrating some other form of Hg control. A discussion of Hg control is presented
below. 

b. 

Mercury Control Technologies.

 The EPA estimates that typical uncontrolled Hg levels for MWC's in the United States range from 0.20 to 1.4 mg/dscm
at 7 percent O

2

. Unlike other metals, Hg has a high vapor pressure at typical operating temperatures of air pollution control devices.
As a result, collection of Hg by the PM control device is highly variable. The EPA collected test data from more than
30 MWC's with various air pollution controls that indicate a wide range of Hg control. High-efficiency PM control,
lower flue gas temperatures in the air pollution control system, and a sufficient level of carbon in the fly ash facilitate
Hg control. Higher levels of carbon in the fly ash and reduced flue gas temperatures enhance Hg adsorption onto the
carbon, which is removed by the PM control device. To promote Hg adsorption, it is important to operate the control
systems at temperatures less than about 150 to 200 
 C. Low flue gas temperature is inherent to acid gas control. 

Municipal waste combustors having high combustion efficiency will have effective carbon burnout and, therefore,
will have low fly ash carbon content. These units may achieve little or no Hg control even when equipped with acid gas/PM
control systems, and the control may be highly variable even at the same site. 

Three techniques for Hg control are currently being used at MWC's: Activated carbon injection, sodium sulfide (Na

2

S) injection, and wet scrubbing. Activated carbon injection and Na

2

S injection are used in conjunction with an existing acid gas control device. Brief discussions of these three Hg control
technologies and their capabilities are presented below. 

Injection of powdered activated carbon into the flue gas prior to the acid gas/PM control device has been tested at
U.S. MWC's. The removal mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed that activated carbon is a catalyst for
the oxidation of elemental Hg to mercuric oxide and mercuric chloride, which can more readily be captured in the air
pollution control device. This technology has been applied commercially to MWC's in Europe equipped with SD/ESP's
and during test programs in Europe and Canada to MWC's with SD/FF's and DSI/FF's. The EPA also tested activated carbon
injection at the Stanislaus County MWC in California and the Camden County MWC in New Jersey. The Stanislaus County
MWC is equipped with an SD/FF, and the Camden County MWC is equipped with an SD/ESP. Test results show Hg reductions
greater than 85 percent when injecting activated carbon. 

A second Hg control technology is Na

2

S injection. Sodium sulfide is a crystalline solid that dissolves in water. The resulting Na

2

S solution is sprayed into the flue gas prior to the acid gas/PM control device. The reaction of Na

2

S and Hg precipitates solid mercuric sulfide (HgS) that is collected in the PM control device. 

Three MWC's in Sweden, two in Germany, and one in Canada have used Na

2

S injection to control Hg emissions. All of these facilities use DSI/FF systems for acid gas/PM control, and injection
of Na

2

S occurs prior to the DSI/FF system at flue gas temperatures of 130 to 250 
 C. In addition, Hg emission tests were conducted at the Stanislaus County MWC in California while using Na

2

S injection. Results from tests at European, Canadian, and U.S. MWC's have shown Hg removal efficiencies of 40 to 90
percent when using Na

2

S injection. 

Wet scrubbing is a form of acid gas control that also controls Hg without use of an add-on Hg control system. It has been
used primarily in Europe and Japan. Typically, the flue gas is first directed through an ESP to reduce PM, followed
by wet scrubbing, which involves passing the flue gas through a one- or two-stage absorber system where the gas stream
is saturated with an alkaline solution. During this process, flue gas temperatures are reduced to as low as 55 
 C. The low absorber operating temperature promotes Hg condensation, resulting in an Hg reduction of 80 percent
or better. The alkaline solution used in the wet scrubbing process, typically containing calcium hydroxide, reacts
with the acid gas to form salts, which are generally insoluble and may be removed by sequential clarifying, thickening,
and vacuum filtering. The dewatered salts or sludges are then sent to a landfill. The disadvantages of wet scrubbing
include the quantity of water required, potential difficulties with waste handling, and undefined performance
at MWC units firing domestic (U.S.) MSW streams.

Nitrogen Oxides Control Technologies

. During the combustion process, NO

X

 are formed through two mechanisms: (1) Oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen (N

2

) contained in MSW to NO

X

; and (2) fixation and oxidation of atmospheric N

2

. In MWC's, the conversion of fuel-bound N

2

 accounts for most (75 to 80 percent) of the NO

X

 production. 
Controlling NO

X

 emissions from MWC's can be accomplished through: (1) Combustion modifications to reduce NO

X

 formation; (2) postcombustion control, which reduces NO

X

 in the flue gas to elemental N

2

; or (3) use of ``low-NO

X

'' combustors to reduce NO

X

 formation. Combustion modifications include staged combustion, low excess air, and flue gas recirculation. Combustion
modification retrofit at existing MWC's has had limited application and its retrofit potential must be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. 
Postcombustion NO

X

 control using selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) is more flexible and has been more commonly used for MWC NO

X

 control. The SNCR control technology reduces NO

X

 to N

2

 without the use of catalysts. Techniques include Thermal DeNO

X



TM

, which injects ammonia into the combustor as a reducing agent; the NO

X

OUT

TM

 process, which injects urea with chemical additives; and a two-stage urea/methanol injection process. A discussion
of SNCR NO

X

 control was presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble (54 FR 52251) for the 1991 NSPS for new MWC's. The use
of SNCR at existing MWC's results in NO

X

 emission reductions of about 45 percent. 
However, for existing mass burn/refractory MWC's, SNCR retrofit problems exist. Mass burn/refractory MWC's are
generally older and operate with greater fluctuations in combustor flue gas temperature profiles than is typical
for other types of MWC's. The fluctuating temperature profiles create SNCR applicability and performance problems.
The SNCR control has not been used nor is expected to be used at mass burn/refractory MWC's or other specialized combustors.

The SNCR technology has also never been applied to a modular combustor, and the performance of such a system on a modular
combustor is questionable. Performance questions arise because of the potential for temperature fluctuations
resulting from batch-feed operations along with the inability of the refractory-lined furnace to dampen temperature
spikes. The EPA requests comment on the applicability of SNCR and other NO

X

 control techniques to MWC's at small plants. The EPA requests that comments address the cost, technical performance,
and reliability of application of SNCR or other NO

X

 control techniques specifically to modular starved-air MWC's and modular excess-air MWC's. Based on the comments
and information received, the EPA will reconsider requiring NO

X

 control on MWC's at small plants. 
Three types of MWC's, mass burn/rotary combustors, fluidized-bed combustors, and modular/excess-air combustors,
are considered ``low NO

X

'' combustors. Available data show that these types of MWC's consistently show NO

X

 levels below 150 ppmv without the use of SNCR. 


2. MACT Floor and MACT Requirements of the Act 


Section 129 of the Act, as amended in 1990, directs the EPA to review and revise the February 11, 1991 guidelines to reflect
MACT. Section 129 also establishes a minimum ``floor'' for the guidelines, in terms of their stringency; specifically:



 * * * emission standards for existing units * * * shall not be less stringent
than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of units in the category * * *.




The intent of this MACT floor is to ensure that the guidelines reflect the performance of the best emission control
technologies currently operating at existing MWC units. A large portion of the existing MWC population is represented
by relatively new and relatively well-controlled MWC units (the average age of an MWC unit is less than 10 years). This
results in a large percentage of existing MWC units being operated with the best emission control technologies. This
subset constitutes about 45 percent of existing MWC units at large MWC plants, and, based on EPA's current information,
these units are all well maintained and operated. Based on the examination and analysis of the emission data available
from these units, the EPA has not found a basis for separating the top 12 percent of these units from the remaining units
in the subset of those units that are well-equipped, maintained, and operated. Consequently, to determine the MACT
floor, the EPA utilized emission limitations included in Federal/State permits. 
Emission limitations for existing MWC units at large plants were determined by examining the air quality permits
for those units obtained from the EPA Regional Offices and by examining responses to section 114 information requests,
which included a section regarding permitted emission limits. Emission limitations for MWC units at small plants
were determined only by examining the responses to section 114 information requests. 
The emission limitations for each pollutant were then converted to common units so that they could be compared. The
emission limitations for each pollutant were ranked separately for the small and large categories of MWC plants.
From those rankings, the average of the top 12 percent of emission limitations (i.e., the average of the most stringent
limitations) for each pollutant in the small and large plant categories were calculated to determine the MACT floors.

The MACT floor defines the minimum level of emission control that may be considered in defining MACT, regardless of
cost or other considerations. In considering control alternatives beyond the MACT floor, the EPA must consider the
cost of achieving such emission reductions and any nonair quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements.
Therefore, the level of control that represents MACT may be more stringent than the MACT floor.

In the proposed regulations, subcategorization of existing MWC units was limited only to size (units at large and
small MWC plants). Since the MACT floors may be sensitive to subcategorization, it is possible that further or alternative
means of subcategorization may affect the determination of the MACT floor (i.e., the minimum level of control requirements
under section 129). The Act provides that ``the Administrator may distinguish among classes, types (including mass-burn,
refuse-derived fuel, modular, and other types of units), and sizes of units within a category'' in establishing MACT
standards. In examining various ways of subcategorization, the EPA found that subcategorization uniformly across
all emission standards could result in more stringent standards for one pollutant and somewhat less stringent standards
for other pollutants. For example, subcategorization by MWC technology generally results in a less stringent MACT
floor for NO

X

 and a more stringent floor for PM. Depending upon the approach used for subcategorization, the NO

X

 MACT floor for some units could be considerably higher than the 215 ppmv floor in the proposed rule. For example, the
NO

X

 MACT floor for mass burn/waterwall units could be 230 ppmv, and the NO

X

 MACT floor for refuse-derived fuel units could be 275 ppmv. 
The EPA is soliciting comments on whether subcategorization (beyond size) should be used in the final rule and on the
basis that one would support for such further subcategorization (e.g., the inapplicability of SNCR for mass burn/refractory
combustors, and the inherently ``low-NO

X

'' emission characteristics of mass burn/rotary combustors, fluidized bed combustors, and modular/excess-air
combustors.) In addition, the EPA is seeking comment on the appropriateness of using different subcategorization
approaches for different pollutants. For example, in setting standards under section 111 of the Act for industrial
boilers, the EPA established different emission standards based on different fuel type inputs. 
The following section presents the EPA's rationale for establishing the MACT floor and MACT for MWC's. 


3. MACT Floor and MACT for Large MWC Plants 


This section summarizes the MACT floor and presents the EPA's rationale for establishing MACT for each pollutant
for MWC's at large MWC facilities. 
a. 

Summary of MACT Floor for Large MWC Plants

. This proposal determines the MACT floor for existing MWC's based on permit limits. The population of MWC's at large
plants consists of about 235 combustor units. Therefore, the top 29 combustor units with the most stringent permit
limitations would represent the top 12 percent of emission limitations for determining the MACT floor. An average
of the top 29 permit limits was calculated to determine the floor for each pollutant. The MACT floor emission levels
for each pollutant for large MWC plants is shown in table 4.

The top 12 percent MACT floor for the emission guidelines could be constructed in a number of different ways including
a permit basis (this proposal), a technology basis, or an emissions data basis. Under a technology basis, MWC's would
be ranked by their control technology to determine the technology used by the average or median of the top 12 percent
of the MWC population, and the floor would be based on the performance of that technology. Under an emission data basis,
data on the best top 12 percent of available test runs would be averaged to calculate the floor. Other approaches are
also possible. The different approaches would result in noticeably different MACT floor performance levels. The
EPA specifically requests comments on what approach is most appropriate and the rationale for that approach. Based
on the EPA's review of comments received on this issue, as well as reanalysis of any data submitted, the MACT floor for
the promulgated guidelines may be noticeably higher or lower than the floor included in the proposal. 
b. 

Discussion of the Selection of MACT for Large MWC Plants. 

After establishing the MACT floor for each pollutant based on permit limits, the EPA considered the cost, health and
environmental impacts, and energy requirements of selecting MACT for each pollutant at a control level more stringent
than the MACT floor. In selecting MACT for each pollutant for large plants, the EPA used principally the data base created
for establishing the emission guidelines for MWC's proposed in 1989 and promulgated in 1991 under subpart Ca. For
a few pollutants in this proposal, the EPA utilized more recent test data to supplement the 1989 data base. Because
most of the test data used for this proposal are more than 4 years old, and in consideration of the fact that most MWC's
retest at least once per year, the EPA requests submittal of the most recent MWC emissions test data. 
The EPA requests comment on which MWC emissions test data would be the most appropriate to use for establishing MACT
for existing MWC's. For example, if the EPA has multiple emission tests for a given MWC over its operating history (which
is common), should the EPA utilize the data from all of the emission tests performed for the unit or from only the most
recent emission test, in determining the performance of the unit? Additionally, the EPA requests comment on suggestions
of analytical methods to use for analyzing the data (e.g., analytical methods that could be used to address emissions
variability, including methods for analyzing variable test data for one MWC collected over multiple years and methods
of adjusting the best 12 percent of the emissions data to account for variability). The appropriate treatment of variability
will be related to the format chosen for the standards (see discussion of alternative formats below). 
Based on the new data submitted and on the final choice of which test data and what analysis methods to use, the EPA may
promulgate final emission guidelines that are more or less stringent than those proposed today. The following sections
IV.F.3.c through IV.F.3.j present the EPA's rationale for selecting MACT for each pollutant for MWC's at large MWC
facilities. 
c. 

MACT for Sulfur Dioxide for Large MWC Plants. 

Uncontrolled levels of SO

2

 for MWC's are typically about 160 ppmv. The MACT floor for SO

2

 at large plants is 35 ppmv. Therefore, acid gas control would be needed to achieve the MACT floor level of control. Both
SD/ESP's and SD/FF's can meet the MACT floor level of control. Tests of many SD/FF's have demonstrated SO

2

 control to levels below 35 ppmv. 
Although SD/FF systems can generally achieve slightly better SO

2

 control than SD/ESP systems, the cost of requiring existing SD/ESP systems to retrofit an SD/FF to meet SO

2

 control levels more stringent than the MACT floor would be prohibitively expensive and is considered unreasonable.
For example, at a typical 1,400 Mg/day MWC plant already equipped with an SD/ESP, the capital cost to remove the ESP
and retrofit a new FF (as part of an SD/FF system) would be about $14 million. This cost would be in addition to paying
the remaining debt for the relatively new ESP (about $5 million including interest payments) and would result in a
relatively small increase in control device efficiency. The incremental cost of control for requiring a retrofit
from an SD/ESP to an SD/FF would be greater than $10,000/Mg of acid gas reduction and would increase SO

2

 removal efficiency by only about 6 percent. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that the MACT guideline level for SO

2

 remain at the MACT floor level of 35 ppmv. Additionally, the EPA is proposing an alternative SO

2

 guideline level of 75-percent reduction to address SO

2

 emissions variability. Therefore, the proposed MACT floor guideline level for SO

2

 is either 35 ppmv or 75-percent reduction (24-hour averaging period), whichever is less stringent. 
d. 

MACT for Hydrogen Chloride for Large MWC Plants. 

Acid gas control would also be needed for large MWC's to reduce HCl emissions from uncontrolled levels of about 500
ppmv to the HCl MACT floor level of 35 ppmv. The same types of acid gas control systems needed to achieve the MACT control
level for SO

2

 will also meet the MACT floor levels of HCl. While it is expected that SD/FF systems could achieve slightly lower HCl
levels than SD/ESP systems, it has not been demonstrated that existing SD/FF or SD/ESP systems can consistently meet
HCl levels below the MACT floor. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that the MACT guideline level for HCl remain at the
MACT floor level of 35 ppmv. Additionally, the EPA is proposing an alternative HCl guideline level of 95-percent reduction
to address HCl emissions variability. Therefore, the proposed MACT floor guideline level for HCl is either 35 ppmv
or 95-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent.

e. 

MACT for Particulate Matter for Large MWC Plants. 

On average, uncontrolled levels of PM from MWC's are about 3,700 mg/dscm. The MACT floor for PM at large MWC plants is
27 mg/dscm. The MACT floor will require greater than a 99-percent reduction in PM emissions. The EPA's analysis of
data from existing MWC's showed that both SD/FF and SD/ESP systems can meet MACT floor PM levels. Although the newest
SD/FF systems can meet levels of less than 15 mg/dscm, SD/ESP systems and many existing SD/FF systems cannot achieve
such levels. Therefore, the proposed MACT for PM at large MWC's is the MACT floor level of 27 mg/dscm. 
f. 

MACT for Cadmium for Large MWC Plants. 

Average uncontrolled levels of Cd are about 1.2 mg/dscm from MWC's. The MACT floor for Cd for large MWC plants is 0.25
mg/dscm. Therefore, the MACT floor will require about 80-percent Cd reduction. As with Pb, Cd control is associated
with PM control. The EPA's analysis of Cd control showed that SD/FF systems can generally achieve Cd levels of less
than 0.010 mg/dscm and that SD/ESP systems can achieve less than 0.040 mg/dscm. The Cd removal efficiency achievable
with an SD/FF is only about 1.2 percent better than an SD/ESP (99.5-percent reduction versus 98.3-percent reduction,
respectively). Again, the high cost of retrofit to an SD/FF is considered unreasonable for such a small incremental
reduction in emissions. Because a level of 0.040 mg/dscm is achievable with both SD/ESP and SD/FF systems, and these
technologies would already be needed to meet MACT for acid gas control, the proposed MACT for Cd is more stringent than
the MACT floor, at a level of 0.040 mg/dscm. 
g. 

MACT for Lead for Large MWC Plants. 

Uncontrolled Pb emissions from MWC's are about 25 mg/dscm, and the MACT floor for large MWC's is 0.53 mg/dscm. A reduction
of about 98 percent would be needed to achieve the MACT floor. The SD/ESP or SD/FF systems needed to meet MACT for acid
gases will also meet the MACT floor for Pb. The EPA's analysis of Pb control showed that SD/FF systems can meet Pb levels
of 0.20 mg/dscm, and SD/ESP systems can meet Pb levels of 0.50 mg/dscm. The Pb removal efficiency achievable with an
SD/FF is only about 0.8 percent better than an SD/ESP (reductions of about 99.8 versus 99.0 percent, respectively).
As explained above, the cost of replacing an SD/ESP with an SD/FF would be unreasonable considering the small difference
in control efficiency. Because both SD/FF and SD/ESP systems can achieve Pb levels of 0.50 mg/dscm, the proposed MACT
for Pb is more stringent than the MACT floor, at a level of 0.50 mg/dscm. 
h. 

MACT for Mercury for Large MWC Plants. 

Uncontrolled levels of Hg from MWC's are about 0.65 mg/dscm on average. The MACT floor for Hg for large plants is 0.36
mg/dscm. The MACT floor, therefore, will require about 40-percent reduction in Hg emissions. As described in section
IV.F.1.b of this preamble, Hg control can be achieved by using activated carbon injection in combination with an acid
gas/PM control system (and the associated low flue gas temperatures). Recent tests at the MWC's at Camden County,
New Jersey (SD/ESP), and Stanislaus County, California (SD/FF), demonstrate that both SD/ESP and SD/FF systems
with activated carbon injection can achieve an 85-percent emission reduction in Hg emissions or an Hg emission level
of 0.080 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O

2

. Data from individual test runs show occasional spikes of high inlet Hg emissions due to the variability in the waste
feed composition. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, a 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently
achievable; however, activated carbon injection could achieve an 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Based
on the data from MWC's using activated carbon injection, Hg control to these levels is achievable by properly operated
systems on all types of MWC's. 
Although the MACT floor requires Hg control, the control levels achievable using SD/ESP or SD/FF systems and activated
carbon injection are more stringent than the MACT floor. The incremental cost of reducing Hg emissions from the MACT
floor level of 0.36 mg/dscm to the demonstrated level of 0.080 is less than about $1.00/Mg of MSW combusted. This incremental
cost is considered reasonable given the toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of Hg. Therefore, the proposed MACT
guidelines for Hg are 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction, whichever is least stringent. 
The EPA has selected activated carbon injection as the basis for achieving MACT for Hg, although facilities may use
any technology capable of meeting the proposed guideline. Of the three Hg control technologies discussed in section
IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that activated carbon injection is the most widely tested of the
three Hg control technologies in the United States. 
i. 

MACT for Dioxins/Furans for Large MWC Plants. 

The average level of dioxins/furans from an uncontrolled MWC is about 1,000 ng/dscm total mass. The MACT floor for
total dioxins/furans of 100 ng/dscm would require about a 90-percent reduction. 
Dioxins/furans are controlled by GCP and acid gas/PM control. Good combustion practices alone can achieve total
dioxin/furan levels of about 500 ng/dscm. In combination with GCP, SD/FF systems can achieve total dioxin/furan
levels less than 30 ng/dscm, and SD/ESP systems can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of less than 60 ng/dscm. Therefore,
the MACT floor (i.e., 100 ng/dscm) can be achieved with either SD/ESP or SD/FF systems, and these systems would already
be the basis for meeting MACT for acid gas and PM emissions. 
As discussed above, the MACT for Hg would be based on activated carbon injection. Recent tests at the Camden County,
New Jersey, MWC showed that the injection of activated carbon into the flue gas of an SD/ESP system provides further
removal of dioxins/furans (greater than 50-percent reduction over levels achieved by the SD/ESP systems). The greater
than 50-percent reduction of the 60 ng/dscm level achieved by an SD/ESP would equate to total dioxin/furan emission
levels below 30 ng/dscm (0.5 ng/dscm dioxin/furan TEQ) for SD/ESP systems with activated carbon injection. 
As noted, SD/ESP or SD/FF systems with activated carbon injection would already be needed to achieve MACT for acid
gas, PM, and Hg. Because both of these control systems in combination with activated carbon injection can achieve
a dioxin/furan emission level of 30 ng/dscm or less, and because of the high cost for retrofitting an SD/FF, the proposed
guideline for dioxin/furan at large MWC's is based on GCP and SD/ESP systems plus activated carbon injection. The
EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ and a total mass basis. The 30 ng/dscm of total dioxins/furans
is equivalent to 0.50 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ; therefore, the proposed guideline level for large MWC plants is
30 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans or 0.50 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ. Comments are requested on whether lower dioxin/furan
guideline levels, which would require SD/FF's, should be incorporated into the final guidelines. 
j. 

MACT for Nitrogen Oxides for Large MWC Plants. 

The average level of NO

X

 emissions from MWC's without postcombustion NO

X

 control is about 225 ppmv. The MACT floor, however, is 215 ppmv. Therefore, postcombustion NO

X

 controls will be needed by most existing MWC's at large plants to meet the MACT floor.

Selective noncatalytic reduction is currently used by 16 existing MWC units at large plants. Tests conducted by the
EPA at the Stanislaus County, California, MWC showed that existing SNCR systems achieve NO

X

 levels of 180 ppmv on a 24-hour average basis. 
Because postcombustion NO

X

 control is required by the MACT floor, and there is only a small incremental cost to operate an SNCR system to achieve
180 ppmv versus the MACT floor level of 215 ppmv, the proposed guideline level for NO

X

 for large plants (excluding mass burn/refractory MWC's) is 180 ppmv. 
As discussed in section IV.F.1.c of this preamble, SNCR may not be effective on mass burn/refractory MWC's. Therefore,
postcombustion NO

X

 control is not being considered for this type of MWC. The MACT guideline for NO

X

 for mass burn/refractory MWC's at large MWC plants is based on no control. Section VIII of this preamble discusses
``no control'' emission limits for NO

X

. 
The EPA recognizes that costs associated with the proposed NO

X

 control requirements for large existing MWC plants are not insignificant. Under the proposal, about 73 percent of
current MWC capacity would be expected to retrofit NO

X

 control. On a national basis, the retrofit of NO

X

 controls to existing MWC plants would cost about $56 million/yr and would represent about 13 percent of the $445 million
annual cost of the entire proposal.
As discussed above, the MACT floor for large MWC plants is 215 ppmv and would require less than 20-percent NO

X

 control (reduction). This could be achieved by application of SNCR technology at a low performance level or, perhaps,
by using combustion modification (e.g., excess air) or materials management. The proposal, however, goes beyond
MACT floor requirements and would establish MACT at 180 ppmv or about 30- to 40-percent NO

X

 reduction based on the full application of SNCR at an MWC with average baseline emissions of 225 ppmv. 
The EPA requests comment on the alternative of establishing NO

X

 standards at the level of the MACT floor (215 ppmv) based on the above approach. The EPA also requests comment and data
supporting the achievability of a MACT floor level (24-hour arithmetic average, corrected to 7 percent O

2

) without the use of an SNCR system. Additionally, the EPA requests data and information on alternative NO

X

 control technologies including but not limited to the application of combustion modification techniques to existing
MWC's or of other management measures (perhaps separation of yard waste) to comply with either the proposed level
or a floor level at a lower cost than an SNCR system. 


4. MACT Floor and MACT for Small MWC Plants 


This section summarizes the MACT floor and presents the EPA's rationale for establishing MACT for each pollutant
for MWC's at small MWC facilities.
a. 

Summary of MACT Floor for Small MWC Plants. 

The proposal determines the MACT floor for existing MWC's based on permit limits. The population of MWC units at small
MWC plants consists of about 137 combustor units. Only 88 of the 137 units are facilities that have federally enforceable
permit limitations. Therefore, for determining the MACT floor, the emission limitations achieved by the top 11 units
in the small MWC plant category represent the top 12 percent of units with federally enforced permit limitations.
Many of the smallest MWC's with unit capabilities below 45 Mg/day (i.e., those MWC's not subject to the 1971 subpart
E NSPS) do not have federally enforceable permit limitations. For some pollutants, less than 11 permits were identified
for the category of small MWC plants (i.e., many small plants with permits have emission limits for only some of the
pollutants covered by the proposed guidelines.) In such cases, typical uncontrolled emission levels for that pollutant
were used for determining the average of the top 12 percent of emission limitations. Table 5 provides a summary of the
MACT floor emission levels for each pollutant for small MWC plants.

As discussed in Section IV.F.3.a. for large plants, the MACT floor could be constructed in a number of different ways
including a permit basis (this proposal), a technology basis, or an emission data basis. Comments are requested on
what approach is most appropriate and the rationalization for the approach. Based on the EPA's review of the comments
received and reanalysis of the data, the MACT floor for the promulgated guidelines may be noticeably higher or lower
than the floor included in the proposal. 

b. 

Discussion of the Selection of MACT for Small MWC Plants. 

After establishing the MACT floor for each pollutant based on permit limits, the EPA considered the cost, health and
environmental impacts, and energy requirements of selecting MACT for each pollutant at a control level more stringent
than the MACT floor. As discussed above for large MWC plants in section IV.F.3.b, in selecting MACT for each pollutant
for small plants, the EPA used principally the data base created for establishing the emission guidelines for MWC's
proposed in 1989 and promulgated in 1991 under subpart Ca. As discussed, the EPA specifically requests submittal
of the most recent MWC emissions test data. Additionally, as discussed, the EPA requests comment on which MWC emissions
test data would be the most appropriate to use for establishing MACT for existing MWC's (e.g., if the EPA has multiple
emission tests for a given MWC over its operating history, should the EPA utilize the data from all of the emission tests
performed for the unit or from only the most recent emission test) and comment on suggestions of analytical methods
to use for analyzing the data (e.g., analytical methods that could be used to address emissions variability, including
methods for analyzing variable test data for one MWC collected over multiple years and methods of adjusting the best
12 percent of the emissions data to account for variability). The appropriate treatment of variability will be related
to the format chosen for the standards (see discussion of alternative formats below).

Based on the new data submitted and on the final choice of which test data to utilize, the EPA may promulgate final emission
guidelines that are more or less stringent than those proposed today. The following sections IV.F.4.c through IV.F.4.j
present the EPA's rationale for selecting MACT for each pollutant for MWC's at small MWC facilities. 

c. 

MACT for Sulfur Dioxide for Small MWC Plants. 

Uncontrolled SO

2

 emissions from MWC's are typically about 160 ppmv, and the MACT floor for SO

2

 for small MWC plants is 120 ppmv. Therefore, MACT will require SO

2

 reduction of about 35 percent compared to uncontrolled levels. Dry sorbent injection/ESP systems can achieve greater
than 50-percent reductions in SO

2

, and can satisfy the MACT floor requirements. Retrofitting a new SD/FF system would achieve greater acid gas control
and small additional reductions in other MWC pollutants, but the associated costs of such retrofits at small MWC's
would be prohibitively high (greater than $10,000/Mg of acid gas reduction). 

Although the MACT floor requires SO

2

 control to only 120 ppmv, the incremental cost of operating a DSI/ESP system to achieve 80 ppmv (about a 50-percent
reduction) versus 120 ppmv is small and results in improved cost effectiveness. Therefore, the MACT guideline proposed
for SO

2

 is more stringent than the MACT floor and is proposed at a level of either 80 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (24-hour averaging
period), whichever is less stringent. 

The EPA recognizes that costs associated with the proposed acid gas control retrofit requirements for small MWC plants
are not insignificant. Small MWC plants represent about 10 percent of the national MWC capacity to be retrofitted
with acid gas control systems, and their associated cost burden would be about 15 percent of the national cost of the
proposal. On a national basis, the retrofit of acid gas controls to small MWC plants would cost about $60 million annually
and the retrofit of acid gas controls to large MWC plants would be about $340 million annually. 

As discussed above, the MACT floor for small MWC plants is 120 ppmv and would require about 35-percent SO

2

 control (reduction). This could be achieved by application of a DSI/ESP scrubbing system. The proposal, however,
goes beyond the MACT floor requirements and would establish MACT at 80 ppmv or 50-percent SO

2

 reduction based on the application of a DSI/ESP at its full optimal capability. Even at optimal conditions, acid gas
scrubbing on MWC units at small plants has a higher control cost ($/Mg acid gas removed) than for MWC units at large plants.
In fact, acid gas control costs for small plants ($/Mg acid gas removed) are more than twice those for large plants.


In the final regulations, the EPA is considering the alternative of establishing acid gas control requirements for
small MWC plants at the level required by the MACT floor (120 ppmv or 35-percent reduction). The EPA requests comment
and data supporting the achievability of a 120 ppmv MACT floor level (24-hour geometric average, corrected to 7 percent
O

2

) without the use of a scrubbing system. Additionally, the EPA requests data and information on alternative acid gas
control technologies that could be applied to MWC units at small plants to comply with a 120 ppmv floor level at a lower
cost than a DSI/ESP system. 

Because some MWC units at small existing MWC plants are operated at a low annual capacity factor and because the cost
effectiveness of acid gas control is sensitive to annual capacity factor, the EPA requests comment on the appropriateness
of subcategorizing MWC units at small plants by annual capacity factor before determining the MACT floor. The reanalysis
after subcategorizing by annual capacity factor may conclude that MACT for low capacity MWC units is less restrictive
than MACT for high capacity MWC units at small existing plants.

If the final guidelines establish different control requirements for low capacity MWC units than high capacity MWC
units, the guidelines would include operational restrictions for low capacity units. That is, each low capacity
MWC unit located at a small MWC plant would be required to have a federally enforceable operating permit that limits
the annual capacity factor of the unit to a specified capacity level, and records would have to be maintained to document
the amount of waste fired in the unit on an annual basis. The annual capacity factor would be calculated on a unit basis
and not on a plant basis. This would assure that obsolete and inoperable MWC units at an MWC site (i.e., with a 0-percent
annual capacity factor) are not averaged together with replacement high capacity units to calculate the annual capacity
factor, with the possible effect of circumvention of emission control requirements for high capacity factor units.
Additionally, if a decision was made to switch a unit from a low capacity operational designation to a high capacity
designation, the unit would have to be retrofitted with emission control equipment to comply with the emission guideline
requirements for high capacity MWC's. 

d. 

MACT for Hydrogen Chloride for Small MWC Plants. 

The MACT floor for HCl for small MWC plants is 660 ppmv, which is above the typical uncontrolled level of about 500 ppmv.
The MACT floor for HCl would not require acid gas control, but MACT for SO

2

 would already require acid gas control based on DSI/ESP systems. Dry sorbent injection/ESP systems used for SO

2

 control can achieve greater than 50-percent reductions in HCl emissions. As discussed above, the cost to retrofit
an SD/ESP or SD/FF system on a small MWC plant would be unreasonably expensive. 

Because a DSI/ESP system operating in a manner that achieves the MACT for SO

2

 would also achieve a 50-percent reduction in HCl, the proposed MACT guideline for HCl at small MWC plants is either
250 ppmv or 50-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent. 

The EPA recognizes that costs associated with the proposed acid gas control retrofit requirements for small MWC plants
are not insignificant. The same acid gas control system used to control SO

2

 emissions controls HCl emissions, and similar issues exist. As discussed under the MACT SO

2

 section, small MWC plants represent about 10 percent of the national MWC capacity to be retrofitted with acid gas control
systems, and the associated cost burden for this acid gas retrofit would be about 15 percent of the national cost of
the proposal. On a national basis, the retrofit of SO

2

/HCl acid gas control systems to small MWC plants would cost about $60 million/yr and the retrofit of acid gas controls
to large MWC plants would be about $340 million/yr. 

As discussed above, the HCl MACT floor for small MWC plants is 660 ppmv and would not require any HCl control. The proposal,
however, goes beyond the MACT floor requirement and would establish MACT at 250 ppmv or 50-percent HCl reduction based
on the DSI/ESP acid gas control system installed for SO

2

 control. The EPA is soliciting comments on the alternative of establishing HCl control requirements for small MWC
plants at the level required by the MACT floor (i.e., 660 ppmv, which requires no control). The EPA requests comment
and data supporting the achievability of a 660 ppmv MACT floor level (24-hour geometric average, corrected to 7 percent
O

2

) without the use of a scrubbing system. 

e. 

MACT for Particulate Matter for Small MWC Plants. 

Average uncontrolled PM emissions from MWC's are about 1,500 mg/dscm. The MACT floor for PM is 85 mg/dscm, which would
require about a 95-percent reduction in PM over uncontrolled levels. 

The MACT floor for PM can be achieved with the same DSI/ESP system needed to meet MACT for the other pollutants. A DSI/ESP
system can achieve PM emissions of less than 69 mg/dscm. The cost to operate a DSI/ESP system to achieve 69 mg/dscm versus
the MACT floor level of 85 mg/dscm is negligible. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for PM for small MWC plants
is below the MACT floor at a level of 69 mg/dscm. 

f. 

MACT for Cadmium for Small MWC Plants. 

Typical uncontrolled levels of Cd from MWC's are about 1.2 mg/dscm. The MACT floor is also 1.1 mg/dscm, thus the MACT
floor requires less than 10-percent Cd control. However, the DSI/ESP systems that would already be needed to achieve
the MACT floor for SO

2

 can achieve Cd levels of 0.10 mg/dscm. The proposed Cd MACT guideline, therefore, is 0.10 mg/dscm based on DSI/ESP
control. 

g. 

MACT for Lead for Small MWC Plants. 

The average uncontrolled emission level of Pb from MWC's is about 25 mg/dscm, and the MACT floor for Pb for small plants
is 15 mg/dscm. The MACT floor requires a 40-percent reduction in Pb. The DSI/ESP systems needed to meet MACT for acid
gases can achieve Pb levels of 1.6 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT for Pb is based on DSI/ESP control, and the proposed MACT
guideline Pb level is 1.6 mg/dscm.

h.

 MACT for Mercury for Small MWC Plants.

 The MACT floor for Hg for small MWC plants is 1.2 mg/dscm, which is above typical uncontrolled Hg emission levels for
MWC's. Therefore, no Hg control is needed to meet the MACT floor. 

Because acid gas/PM control systems (DSI/ESP) will be needed at small plants to meet other MACT requirements, activated
carbon injection could be added to the acid gas/PM control system to achieve Hg control. The incremental cost to add
activated carbon injection to control Hg at small MWC plants already equipped with acid gas/PM control is about $1.40/Mg
of MSW combusted. The EPA believes that this cost is reasonable given the concerns over the bioaccumulation of Hg in
the environment. 

In addition to the EPA's test programs to study Hg removal using SD-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon
injection, the EPA has also conducted Hg performance tests of DSI-based scrubbing systems with activated carbon
injection at small MWI's (Borgess, Michigan, MWI). The use of activated carbon injection with either SD-based scrubbing
systems or DSI-based scrubbing systems has demonstrated greater than 85-percent Hg control. 

In combination, DSI/ESP systems with activated carbon injection can achieve Hg emission levels of 0.080 mg/dscm
or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline for Hg for small MWC plants is 0.080
mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction, whichever is less stringent.

i. 

MACT for Dioxins/Furans for Small MWC Plants.

 The MACT floor for total dioxins/furans is 1,700 ng/dscm, which is above typical uncontrolled levels of about 1,000
ng/dscm. Although the MACT floor for dioxins/furans would be based on no control, DSI/ESP is already needed to meet
MACT for other pollutants, and GCP are needed to meet MWC operational and CO requirements. The combination of GCP and
DSI/ESP can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of less than 125 ng/dscm.

As discussed above, MACT for Hg for small plants would be based on using activated carbon injection. Activated carbon
injection provides additional removal of dioxins/furans beyond that achieved by the acid gas/PM control system,
as discussed in the rationale for MACT for dioxins/furans for large plants. Recent tests at small MWI's using DSI systems
with activated carbon injection have also shown that additional dioxin/furan removal is achieved with activated
carbon injection (greater than a 50-percent reduction over levels achieved by the acid gas/PM control system). Based
on the use of activated carbon injection with GCP and DSI/ESP systems, a level of 60 ng/dscm would be achievable. The
EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ basis and a total mass basis. Based on EPA's analysis, a total
dioxin/furan level of 60 ng/dscm is equivalent to 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ. Therefore, the proposed MACT guideline
for MWC's at small plants is 1.0 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total mass dioxins/furans.

 MACT for Nitrogen Oxides for Small MWC Plants.

 Uncontrolled NO

X

 emissions from MWC's are about 225 ppmv on average. The MACT floor is no control. The addition of SNCR postcombustion
NO

X

 control has not been demonstrated on any modular starved-air MWC's, and the performance of such a system on a modular
starved-air MWC is in question. Since NO

X

 control is not required by the MACT floor and SNCR has not been demonstrated on modular starved-air MWC's, postcombustion
NO

X

 control is not being proposed for small MWC's. The MACT guideline for NO

X

 for MWC's at small MWC plants is based on no control. Section VIII of this preamble discusses ``no control'' emission
limits for NO

X

.



G.

 Selection of Format for the Proposed Guidelines



The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines described a format for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), and MWC operating practices (CO, load, and
flue gas temperature), and that same format is being adopted by today's proposed guidelines, except for dioxins/furans.
The selection of the format for the emission guidelines for the above pollutants is described in previous 

Federal Register

 notices (54 FR 52209, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5514, February 11, 1991). For dioxins/furans, the proposed guidelines
establish dioxin/furan guideline emission levels on both a total mass dioxins/furans basis and a TEQ basis. The format
for the proposed emission guidelines for NO

X

 is the same as the format of the 1991 NSPS (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991) and today's proposed subpart Eb NSPS. The selection
of the format for the 1991 NO

X

 standard is in previous 

Federal Register

 notices (54 FR 52251, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). The same format will apply under the emission
guidelines for NO

X

 proposed today for MWC's at large plants. The specific formats of the proposed emission guidelines for Cd, Pb, and
Hg are discussed below. 

As required by section 129(a)(4) of the Act, the proposed emission guidelines would establish numerical emission
limitations for Cd, Pb, and Hg. For the purpose of regulating Cd and Pb, the format selected in the proposed emission
guidelines for the numerical emission limitations would be a numerical concentration limit (mg/dscm) corrected
to 7 percent O

2

. For the purpose of regulating Hg, the format selected in the proposed emissions guidelines would be both a numerical
concentration limit (mg/dscm) and an alternative percentage reduction requirement. The numerical Hg emission
limit reflects the emission level that can be achieved based on activated carbon injection in combination with acid
gas/PM control. An alternative percentage reduction requirement may be met instead of the numerical emission level
because emissions of Hg can be highly variable and dependent on the Hg input level. Even at the same MWC, test data show
occasional spikes of high Hg emissions due to variability in the waste feed. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily
elevated, the 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable. However, the control devices could achieve
an 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Therefore, a combination of a concentration level and an optional
percentage reduction format best assures the maximum achievable Hg control while accommodating potential spikes
in Hg emission levels.

As discussed above, the proposed emission guidelines for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg include two formats: (1) A percent reduction format, and (2) an emission limit (concentration) format.
The EPA requests comment on and test data supporting the appropriateness of promulgating final guidelines for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg which include only the emission limit format. For each pollutant, the commenter should specify an appropriate
emission limit (without an associated alternative percent reduction format) and provide rationale for the limit.
Based on the comments received, the EPA may promulgate final emission guidelines for SO

2

, HCl, and Hg in the form of emission limits that are higher or lower than the proposed emission limits.

The EPA has proposed emission guidelines that reflect the performance levels achieved by MWC's equipped with properly
designed, constructed, and operated air pollution control systems. The proposed emission guideline levels would
apply during all periods of MWC operation. To comply with the proposed guideline levels, the air pollution control
system would be designed and operated such that actual emissions are less than the proposed guideline levels. Where
continuous monitoring systems are available, such as for SO

2

 and NO

X

, the proposal would require their use to determine compliance on a continuous basis. For other pollutants, an annual
stack test would be required. The EPA requests comment on whether continuous monitoring methods exist for any additional
pollutants. 

The EPA also seeks comments on alternate formats of the guidelines that would encourage optimal control system operation
and optimal performance, thus minimizing emissions. For example, the guidelines could provide incentives, such
as reduced testing and reporting, for MWC's that operate well below the guideline emission levels. One approach would
be to structure the guideline such that, for an MWC with three units, if all units demonstrated emissions at least 30
percent less than the limit, then only one of the units would be tested each year. The unit selected for testing would
be rotated such that each unit would be tested once every three years.

<TEXT>
 

Another potential regulatory approach to assure optimal performance would be to supplement the current emission
guidelines (which must be demonstrated by annual stack tests) with more stringent emission guidelines calculated
for each pollutant based on long-term average emission levels. Compliance with this supplemental emission level
would be determined by continuous monitoring, where applicable, or by the average of the annual tests from the current
year and one or more preceding years. The current guideline emission levels account for variability from one emissions
test to another, whereas the composite average emission levels would reflect the mean performance level. This may
be a preferable measure of environmental performance for some of the pollutants because it is their long term or cumulative
emissions that are of most concern. Other formats of the guidelines that encourage optimal performance would also
be possible. Comments and suggestions are requested. Based on the information and comments received, the EPA may
change the form of the rule 
to include a long term emissions average, and alternative compliance testing schedule, or other alternative format
to encourage optimal performance of the air pollution control system. 
Additionally, the EPA requests comment and suggestions on specific work practice requirements or equipment requirements
that would assure optimal operation of the air pollution control system and minimize emissions. Such operating practices
or equipment practices would be most beneficial for minimizing emissions of those pollutants for which annual stack
testing is the proposed compliance test method. Comments are specifically requested on work practices or equipment
requirements that would minimize dioxin/furan, Hg, Cd, and PM emissions. Based on the information received, the
EPA may require specific work practices or equipment to supplement the emission limits included in the final guidelines.



H. Performance Test Methods and Monitoring Requirements 


The emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514) for MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day
established performance testing and monitoring requirements for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), and MWC operating practices (CO, load, and
flue gas temperature). These same requirements would be adopted under today's proposed emission guidelines, except
that: (1) Procedures are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis; (2) testing schedule
provisions have been incorporated for annual compliance testing for PM (opacity not included), HCl, and dioxins/furans
at small MWC plants; and (3) annual opacity tests using EPA Reference Method 9 (in combination with continuous monitoring
of opacity levels) would be required for both large and small MWC plants. Furthermore, today's proposal includes
new data availability requirements for CEMS. Today's proposal requires that valid paired CEMS hourly averages (i.e.,
SO

2

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), NO

X

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), and CO and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the MWC is operating
and combusting MSW.

Because the proposed NSPS allows compliance with a dioxin/furan limit either on a TEQ basis or on a total mass basis,
procedures are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. For measuring dioxins/furans
on a TEQ basis, the mass of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa- congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method
23. Each congener mass would then be adjusted by the corresponding TEF's, which are listed in the proposed NSPS. Finally,
the adjusted congener masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in terms of nanograms per dry standard
cubic meter TEQ. 
As required by the 1991 subpart Ca emission guidelines, following the initial performance test for PM, HCl, and dioxins/furans,
subsequent annual performance tests would be required for all MWC's to demonstrate compliance with the PM, HCl, and
dioxin/furan emission limits. Under today's proposed emission guidelines, if three consecutive annual compliance
tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (i.e., PM, HCl, or dioxins/furans),
the MWC would be allowed to wait 3 years before retesting for the pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year
shows compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant, then the facility could again wait 3 years to test for
the pollutant. If noncompliance with the emission limit for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required
to be undertaken and annual testing would be required to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with
the emission limit is established. At a minimum, performance tests for dioxins/furans, HCl, and PM would be required
to be performed for each MWC at a small MWC plant every 3 years. This provision is included to minimize costs for small
MWC plants, while still retaining periodic testing to ensure compliance. 
Testing and monitoring requirements are being proposed in today's emission guidelines for NO

X

, Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions. The 1991 NSPS for MWC's includes performance testing and monitoring requirements for NO

X

. These testing and monitoring requirements are described in the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488).
These same testing and monitoring requirements would apply to MWC's only at large plants under today's proposed emission
guidelines. 
For Cd, Pb, and Hg, annual performance tests would be required for MWC's subject to the proposed emission guidelines.
The performance test for all three metals would be conducted in accordance with EPA Reference Method 29. The EPA Reference
Method 1 would be used for determining the number and location of sampling points. The EPA Reference Method 3 would
be used for flue gas analysis. All performance tests would consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under representative
operating conditions (i.e., at full load). The average Cd, Pb, and Hg emission rates of the three runs or more would
be used to determine compliance. 
Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate compliance with the Cd, Pb,
and Hg emission limits for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing for these three pollutants every
third year. At a minimum, performance tests for Cd, Pb, and Hg would be required to be performed by small MWC plants every
3 years. Large plants must test for each of these pollutants annually. These annual testing requirements are consistent
with those for other pollutants, and MWC plants can reduce testing expenses by testing for multiple pollutants during
the same test period. 
Studies conducted by the EPA have shown EPA Reference Method 29 to be a more reliable method for measuring Hg from MWC's
than EPA Reference Method 101A. Recent refinements have been made to Method 101A, but the EPA has concluded that Method
29 is a superior method. 
In a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

, EPA Reference Method 29 is being proposed for determining emissions of Hg and other metals from MWC's, MWI's, and
power plants. Method 29 consists of a particulate filter followed in series by two nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide
(HNO

3

/H



2O

2

) impingers and two acidified potassium permangenate (KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

) impingers. The method is identical to the EPA's Office of Solid Waste multimetals method, except that Method 29 requires
filtration and analysis of the impinger solution collected in the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers. These filtration and analysis requirements are being added to the method for quality assurance purposes
to protect against the loss of Hg in the manganese oxide (MnO

2

) precipitate that can form in this solution. This additional step will result in similar sample preparation and analysis
requirements for EPA Reference Methods 29 and 101A. 
The EPA does not believe that addition of this filtration and analysis step will change the achievable Hg emission
rates for MWC's and MWI's. Because of the significant amount of chlorine in MWC and MWI flue gas, most of the Hg in these
flue gases occurs as water-soluble ionic Hg. As a result, use of Method 29 collects most of the Hg in these flue gases
on the filter and in the HNO

3

/H

2

O

2

 impingers, with the remainder collected in the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers. Flue gases emitted from processes having lower chlorine levels and/or higher sulfur levels (e.g., coal-fired
power plants) have a higher fraction of their Hg emissions present as water-insoluble elemental Hg that is collected
in the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers. 
In testing conducted by the EPA at an MWC during which Method 101A KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impinger solutions were filtered and the filters analyzed (with Method 101A, all of the Hg in the flue gas is collected
by the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers), results showed that less than 3 percent of the total Hg collected by the sampling train was associated
with precipitated MnO

2

.

Based on review of analytical procedures used with multimetal train samples collected during several other EPA-sponsored
test programs, the EPA believes the potential loss of Hg in precipitated MnO

2

 during these tests was less than 3 percent (during these tests, the KMnO

4

/H

2

SO

4

 impingers were shaken prior to removal of a representative analytical sample and, thus, a portion of any precipitated
MnO

2

 was likely to have been included in the analytical sample). 


Because the analytical filter only makes a negligible difference in the Hg test results for MWC's and because it is
desirable to use a uniform Hg test method for all source categories, the EPA is proposing that the full Method 29 test
procedures (including the analytical filter analysis) be used for measuring Hg emissions from MWC's. 

Overall, the proposed guidelines would require that CEMS be used as the compliance test method for those pollutants
for which CEMS are available (i.e., SO

2

, NO

X

, CO, CO

2

 (or O

2

), opacity, MWC load level, and air pollution control device temperature). For those pollutants for which CEMS are
not available (i.e., HCl, Hg, Cd, Pb, PM, and dioxins/furans), the proposed guidelines would require that stack test
methods be used on an annual basis to determine compliance. Progress continues to be made on the development of new
and improved CEMS. The EPA requests comment on the availability of CEMS to replace stack testing for any of the pollutants
listed above. The EPA specifically requests comment on the availability, precision, accuracy, and cost of CEMS for
HCl and Hg. Based on the information received, the EPA will reconsider CEMS requirements and may increase the number
of pollutants monitored by CEMS. 


I. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Compliance Schedule Requirements 


The proposed emission guidelines would require owners and operators of all designated facilities to submit notifications
of the anticipated date of startup and initial performance test and performance evaluation of the CEMS (where applicable).

The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines for MWC's established reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC
acid gases, MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM and opacity), and MWC operating practices. These reporting
and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in the previous 

Federal Register

 notice promulgating the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines (56 FR 5514). These same reporting and recordkeeping
requirements would be adopted under today's proposed guidelines with the following exceptions: (1) Dioxin/furan
emissions would be recorded and reported either in terms of dioxin/furan TEQ or as total mass of dioxins/furans; (2)
if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria allowing them to conduct compliance tests for PM, HCl, or dioxins/furans
every third year (see section IV.H of this preamble), they would submit a simplified annual report for years where
testing for those pollutants was not required; and (3) both small and large MWC plants would be required to report the
results of annual EPA Reference Method 9 opacity tests. 
Recordkeeping and reporting requirements are being proposed in today's emission guidelines for NO

X

, Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements for NO

X

 are described in the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488). Under today's proposed emission guidelines,
these reporting and recordkeeping requirements would apply only to MWC's at large plants. 
After an initial performance test has been completed, the proposed emission guidelines would additionally require
the submission of annual compliance reports for Cd, Pb, and Hg. However, if MWC's at small plants have met the criteria
allowing them to conduct compliance tests for Cd, Pb, or Hg every third year (see section IV.H of this preamble), they
would submit a simplified annual report for years where testing for those pollutants was not required. 
The proposed emission guidelines would require that certain types of records be maintained. If an activated carbon
injection system is used for Hg control, MWC plants would be required to keep records of the quantity of activated carbon
used for each 8-hour period of MWC operation. These records would provide documentation that these systems continue
to be operated properly between compliance tests. Initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash fugitive
emissions testing would be required for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants. 
The proposed guidelines would also require that records be kept regarding the training and certification status
of individuals involved in the operation of the MWC. The proposed guidelines would specify that all training and certification
requirements be met within 1 year after the date of promulgation of the guidelines. 
The proposed emission guidelines include revised compliance scheduling requirements. The proposed guidelines
require State plans to require both small and large MWC plants to meet one of the following two compliance schedules:
(1) Full compliance with the State plan by no later than 1 year after the approval of the State plan; or (2) full compliance
with the State plan by no later than 3 years following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit
modification is required, or within 3 years following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required,
provided the State plan includes measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress toward compliance with
the State plan. Suggested items for specification in the State plan would be as follows: 
(1) Date for obtaining the services of an architectural and engineering firm; 
(2) Date for obtaining design drawings of the pollution control device(s); 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Date of for submittal of permit modifications, if necessary; 
(4) Date for ordering the pollution control device(s); 
(5) Date for delivery of the major components of the air pollution control device(s); 
(6) Date of initial site preparation for installing the pollution control device(s); 
(7) Date for commencing installation of the pollution control device(s); 
(8) Date of initial startup of the air pollution control device(s); and 
(9) Date for the initial compliance test(s) of the air pollution control device(s). 


The date associated with each of these incremental steps in a compliance schedule would be established on a site-specific
basis, by the State air pollution control agency. Furthermore, submittal of the State plan would be required to include
performance test results for dioxin/furan emissions for those MWC units with a compliance schedule longer than 1
year from the date of approval of the State plan. These tests results would be required to have been measured no earlier
than 1990 and would be considered by a State in developing a facility's compliance schedule. 


In the event no plan for implementing the emission guidelines is adopted, all MWC units covered by the guidelines would
be required to be in compliance with the guidelines no later than the date 5 years after the date of promulgation of these
guidelines. 
Because of recent concern about dioxin/furan and Hg emissions, the proposed emission guidelines require State plans
to include an accelerated compliance schedule for compliance with the emission limits for these two pollutants for
one subset of MWC's. Under the accelerated schedule, existing MWC units for which construction, modification, or
reconstruction commenced after June 26, 1987 and that are located at large MWC plants would be required to be in compliance
with the proposed dioxin/furan and Hg emission guidelines within 1 year following issuance of a revised construction
or operation permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 1 year following approval of the State plan, if
a permit modification is not required. On June 26, 1987, the EPA issued operational guidance to State and local agencies
for best available control technology (BACT) determinations for permitting of both new and modified MWC's, pursuant
to the new source review (NSR) provisions of the Act. This operational guidance has resulted in all new MWC's at large
MWC plants permitted since June 26, 1987 being constructed with an SD/ESP or SD/FF control system. As discussed in
section IV.F.1 of this preamble, control of dioxins/furans and Hg is based on the combination of an acid gas/PM control
system and a carbon injection system. Since all MWC units at large MWC plants permitted since June 26, 1987 have been
subject to NSR and are, therefore, already equipped with the appropriate acid gas/PM control devices for dioxin/furan
and Hg control (i.e., SD/ESP or SD/FF), the EPA concluded that it would be reasonable to require that carbon injection
be retrofitted to these MWC units according to an accelerated schedule in order to achieve additional dioxin/furan
and Hg emission reductions as soon as possible. 
Additionally, compliance with all operator training and certification guidelines would be required by 1 year after
the date of promulgation of the emission guidelines. 
All reports submitted under this rulemaking would also be required to be maintained as part of these records. All the
information contained in these records would be made available to enforcement personnel upon request. All required
records would be required to be maintained for 5 years following the date of such records. 
The reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the proposed emission guidelines are necessary to inform enforcement
personnel of the compliance status of existing MWC's. In addition, the records would provide the data and information
necessary to ensure continued compliance of these MWC's with the emission guidelines. At the same time, these requirements
have been structured so as not to impose an unreasonable burden on MWC owners or operators.

V. Rationale for the Proposed Guidelines for Fugitive Fly Ash/Bottom Ash Emissions



The following discussion addresses the basis for EPA's decision to regulate fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions
from MWC facilities. The available technologies for controlling these fugitive emissions and the EPA's selection
of MACT for these emissions are presented.



A. Background



Fugitive emissions from MWC's are emissions of dust from fly ash and bottom ash handling that are not confined (i.e.,
emissions that are not contained within a fully enclosed ash handling system). The fly ash/bottom ash dust consists
of PM and various associated pollutants adsorbed to the PM such as Cd, Pb, Hg, and organic compounds (e.g., dioxins/furans).
A study of MWC ash handling and storage facilities has shown that such facilities, when improperly controlled, can
be sources of these pollutants through fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions. Therefore, visible emission guidelines
for fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions are being proposed to ensure that control equipment and operating practices
are implemented to eliminate such emissions. Currently, more than 12 percent of existing MWC's use control systems
to eliminate fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions.



B. Fugitive Emission Control Techniques



Sources of MWC fugitive bottom ash/fly ash emissions include the ash storage facilities (including ash storage bins
or piles), fly ash and bottom ash conveyors and conveyor transfer points, and truck or container loading facilities.

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from conveyors can be controlled by totally enclosing the conveyors when they
are not already inside an enclosed structure. Emissions from conveyor transfer points can be controlled by totally
enclosing the transfer point and ventilating it to a control device if the transfer point is not inside an enclosed
structure. Alternatively, maintaining adequate moisture in the fly ash and bottom ash can be used to control fugitive
emissions from conveyors or transfer points.

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash storage facilities at an MWC plant can be controlled by totally
enclosing the ash storage areas and by ensuring that the fly ash and bottom ash have an adequate moisture content to
prevent dust. Chemical stabilizers and binders may also be used in addition to or in place of moisture to prevent dust
emissions from MWC ash for nearly all the activities described in this section.

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from truck or container loading facilities at the MWC can be controlled primarily
by the moisture content of the ash. Fly ash or bottom ash can be passed through a water-filled quench tank to wet the ash.
Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from the ash loading facility at the MWC may also be controlled by enclosing
the ash loading facility, fitting the truck bays with doors that can be closed, and discharging the vent air to a control
device. Emissions can also be controlled by reducing ash spills during loading and by recovering any spilled ash through
sweeping, vacuuming, or washing before the spilled ash can dry or be tracked out of the loading facility.

Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from moving trucks used for hauling ash from the MWC can be controlled by ensuring
that the ash is moist and that the truck or container is properly sealed and covered during transit. Trucks can be covered
with tarps, and truck tires can be washed prior to leaving the ash handling facility to prevent ash from being tracked
onto roadways where it can later become airborne as fugitive dust emissions.

Data collected at several MWC's indicate that when the control methods described above are applied in a consistent
and conscientious manner, fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions can be controlled so that no visible emissions are
observed from the ash storage facilities or from ash transfer points such as conveyors, trucks or container loading
facilities, and trucks hauling MWC ash.



C. Proposed Fugitive Emissions Guidelines



An emission guideline level of no visible emissions of fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from ash storage facilities
and transfer points is consistent with the determination that the controls described above represent MACT.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-1-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, the following MACT guidelines are being proposed. Fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions from any MWC
ash storage facility or any ash transfer point at an MWC plant with aggregate capacity to combust greater than 35 Mg/day
of MSW would be required to be controlled so that no visible emissions are detected.

The fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions guidelines would be determined using EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous
visual observation). Compliance with the visible emissions guidelines would be determined by an annual performance
test. Reports of initial and annual performance tests would be required.

Any technology may be used to meet these standards. The fly ash/bottom ash fugitive emissions guidelines would apply
to ash handling facilities within the property boundary of the MWC including trucks moving away from the MWC, but would
not apply to offsite transport of ash.



VI. Proposed Guidelines for Air Curtain Incinerators



Air curtain incinerators operate by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across the top of an open chamber or pit.
The air curtain reduces emissions during operation by promoting better combustion. Incinerators of this type are
built either above or below ground and typically have refractory walls and a floor. Section 129 of the Act exempts air
curtain incinerators firing MSW from the definition of ``municipal waste combustion unit'' provided that the air
curtain incinerator burns only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber and that it complies with
an opacity limit that would be established by the EPA. As clarified under the proposed guidelines, ``untreated lumber''
means that the lumber has not been painted, pigment-stained, or ``pressure treated.''

Today's proposed guidelines include guideline opacity levels specifically for air curtain incinerators that would
combust greater than 35 Mg/day of only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber. The proposed opacity
levels are 10-percent opacity (6-minute average), except that a level of up to 35 percent (6-minute average) would
be allowed during the first 30 minutes of operation of the unit. The proposed opacity levels are based on levels achieved
by well-designed and operated air curtain incinerators. Compliance with the air curtain incinerator opacity guidelines
would be demonstrated by conducting an annual compliance test in accordance with EPA Reference Method 9.

Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities above 35 Mg/day that burn MSW other than yard wastes, tree trimmings,
or clean untreated lumber are covered by the emission guidelines for MWC's. Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities
above 35 Mg/day that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, or clean untreated lumber would be subject to the proposed
opacity guideline and its associated testing, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements, but would not be subject
to any other parts of the proposed emission guidelines.



VII. Comparison of the Proposal and European Emission Limits



Europe is more densely populated than the United States and the combustion of MSW became increasingly common after
World War II. Because European countries have more experience combusting MSW, it is interesting to compare the emission
control requirements for MWC's located in the Member States of the European Union (EU) to those for MWC's in the United
States. In addition to comparing emission requirements, the EPA also compared the prevalence of waste combustion
in the United States and the EU.

In general, MSW combustion is more common in the EU than in the United States. There are 12 members of the EU: Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal.
The percentage of waste combusted in many of the EU countries is over 30 percent, with Denmark, Luxembourg, and The
Netherlands, combusting 60, 60, and 40 percent of their waste, respectively. As a national average for the United
States, 16 percent of the waste generated is combusted. In the Eastern United States, where the majority of MWC's are
located, the rate of waste combustion is higher, averaging 25 to 30 percent. In the New England region, the rate of waste
combustion approaches 60 percent. Therefore, although the United States as a whole has a much lower rate of waste combustion
than does the EU, certain regions of the United States have combustion rates similar to those of the EU.

Factors such as population density, percentage of urbanization, land availability, and topography/geology influence
the method of waste disposal for a country or a region. In the EU, the majority of the countries have population densities
that range from 200 to 600 people per square mile and urban population percentages of 60 to 90 percent. The United States,
in comparison, has a much lower average population density of approximately 70 people per square mile, and the percentage
of the population living in urban areas is approximately 75 percent. In the Eastern United States, the population
density and percentage of urban population are higher than national levels, at around 200 people per square mile with
over 80 percent of the population living in urban areas, which is comparable to most of Europe. As noted above, other
factors contribute to the use of MWC technology. For example, in Florida, the geology is such that in some cases landfilling
waste is not a desirable option. Similarly, the mountainous regions in parts of Europe restrict the use of landfilling,
and the increased usage of MWC's is common.

Regarding regulatory development in the EU, the EU sets uniform environmental guidelines, and individual EU countries
may adopt those guidelines or more stringent requirements. This is similar to the role the EPA plays with the individual
States. Table 6 presents: (1) The proposed EPA emission guidelines for existing MWC plants with capacities above
35 and 225 Mg/day; and (2) the EU limits that apply to new and existing plants. Existing MWC plants in the EU with capacities
greater than 144 Mg/day must meet these requirements by December 1, 1996. All other existing plants with capacities
between 24 and 144 Mg/day must meet these requirements by December 1, 2000.

As shown in table 6, the EU guidelines cover many of the same pollutants as the EPA emission guidelines proposed in today's
notice. There are differences between the EPA and the EU guidelines with regard to regulatory flexibility for demonstrating
compliance, as well as the test methods used to measure emissions. Factors like these should be considered when comparing
emission requirements. The EPA and EU both have set standards for PM, HCl, SO

2

, and CO. For these pollutants, the allowable emission levels proposed by the EPA for large MWC plants are more restrictive
than the EU guidelines. For small MWC plants, the proposed EPA emission guidelines are more restrictive for CO. No
EU limits exist for NO

x

 or dioxins/furans, and the EU metals emission limits are for combined metals (e.g., Hg+Cd). As shown in table 6, the
proposed EPA guidelines for both large and small plants for Hg and Cd, if combined, are lower than the EU Hg+Cd limit.

Some of the EU countries have adopted limits that are more stringent than the general EU guidelines. For example, The
Netherlands has recently adopted standards for new and existing MWC's that are considered to be some of the most stringent
in the world. For example, the Dutch Hg limit of 0.065 mg/dscm for existing MWC's (corrected to 7 percent O

2

) is lower than both the EU limit and the EPA's proposed Hg guidelines of 0.080 mg/dscm. The Dutch dioxin/furan limit
for existing MWC's ranges from 0.13 to 0.52 ng/dscm TEQ (the limit varies depending on site-specific economics of
the MWC). These limits are more restrictive than the EPA's proposed guidelines (0.5 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total
dioxins/furans for large MWC plants and 1.0 ng/dscm TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans for small MWC plants).
As noted, the EU has no dioxin/furan guideline. 
It is difficult to compare the Dutch standards directly to the EPA emission guidelines or to the performance of U.S.
MWC's because the test methods used in The Netherlands to measure emissions are different from those used in the United
States. Also, many Dutch MWC's are currently completing retrofits in order to meet the Dutch standards by January
1995. The actual performance level of the MWC units will be unknown until that time. 
As with some of the EU countries, some of the individual States are establishing more stringent emissions standards
than those in today's proposed guidelines. Brief descriptions of the regulations under consideration in Florida,
Minnesota, and New Jersey are presented below. 
The State of Florida has promulgated a regulation that would set an Hg emission limit of 0.070 mg/dscm (corrected to
7 percent O

2

), or an 80-percent Hg reduction, for facilities that install Hg control equipment (e.g., activated carbon injection)
and that are equipped with acid gas control equipment. This limit must be met by July 1, 1995, and compliance must be
demonstrated annually using EPA Reference Method 101A. For facilities equipped with acid gas control equipment
that choose to control Hg exclusively through the use of an Hg waste separation program, Hg emissions would be limited
to 0.14 mg/dscm after July 1, 1995 and to 0.070 mg/dscm after July 1, 1997. Compliance must be demonstrated semiannually
using EPA Reference Method 101A. Facilities not currently equipped with acid gas controls will be required to meet
the proposed Hg emission limits when the facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the acid gas limits included
in the EPA's proposal. Florida's rulemaking procedures to develop SO

2

 and HCl emission limits will be initiated by December 1, 1994 unless the Federal emission guidelines (today's action)
have been proposed by that date. 
The State of Minnesota has also promulgated Hg requirements for MWC's. For mass burn MWC's with acid gas control, the
quarterly Hg emission limit (one three-test run average) is 0.10 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O

2

). However, the annual average Hg emissions limit (average of the four most recent quarterly tests) is 0.060 mg/dscm.
Measurements must be made using EPA Reference Method 29. The Minnesota requirement also allows MWC's to demonstrate
compliance with the quarterly and annual limits by achieving an alternative 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions.

Similar to the Florida regulations, the Minnesota regulation provides less stringent standards for MWC's without
acid gas control until the time that acid gas control is required.

The State of New Jersey will be proposing an Hg standard for MWC's of 0.028 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O

2

), which would be effective as of January 1, 2000, and an interim standard of 0.065 mg/dscm or an 80-percent reduction,
which would be effective as of December 31, 1995. The 0.028 mg/dscm limit is based on reducing the uncontrolled Hg emission
level (assumed to be 0.70 mg/dscm) by 80 percent through reduction of Hg in the waste burned, and another 80-percent
reduction from Hg in the flue gas. These limits are annual averages based on quarterly 3-run testing (i.e., a total
of 12 runs), using EPA Reference Method 29. 


VIII. Miscellaneous 


This section addresses the four following issues: (1) The selection of a ``no control'' limit for NO

X

 for MWC's at small MWC plants, (2) the July 14, 1992 remand of the issue of lead-acid vehicle battery combustion, (3)
request for comments about requiring a materials separation plan for existing MWC plants, and (4) general request
for comment on the proposal. 
Regarding the first issue, section 129 of the Act specifies that standards and guidelines for MWC's must include emission
limits for PM, opacity, SO

2

, HCl, NO

X

, CO, Pb, Cd, Hg, and dioxins/furans. This means that emission limits for these pollutants must be specified even if
the MACT selected for a subcategory of facilities does not control that particular pollutant. In particular, MACT
requirements for small MWC plants are based on usage of GCP, DSI/ESP, and activated carbon injection, but NO

X

 control is not required. Also, MACT requirements for mass burn/refractory MWC's at large MWC plants are based on usage
of GCP, SD/ESP, and activated carbon injection, but NO

X

 control is not required under today's proposal (see section IV.F.1.c for additional discussion). Therefore, a ``no
control'' NO

X

 limit is proposed for MWC's at small MWC plants and for mass burn/refractory MWC's at large MWC plants. The proposed
``no control'' limit for NO

X

 for these MWC's is 500 ppmv. The proposed guidelines do not include any testing, reporting, or recordkeeping associated
with the ``no control'' emission limit. The 500 ppmv limit represents an emission level higher than any of the test
data and allows an adequate margin to accommodate the variability in NO

X

 emission levels. The EPA expects that this ``no control'' limit will not be exceeded. The EPA requests public comments
on whether it is appropriate to include such a ``no control'' emission limit in the final emission guidelines or whether
such a limit is not necessary. 
Regarding the second issue, on December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed NSPS and emission guidelines for new and existing
MWC's under section 111 of the Act. The proposed NSPS and emission guidelines included a prohibition on the combustion
of lead-acid vehicle batteries in MWC's. On February 11, 1991, the EPA promulgated standards and guidelines for new
and existing MWC that did not prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries. The decision not to prohibit
the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit by NRDC, the State of New York, and the State of Florida. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit concluded that the EPA had not adequately explained its decision not to require a lead acid battery
separation as part of the 1991 NSPS and emission guidelines, when it had included such a requirement in its proposed
rule (

State of New York

 v. 

Reilly,

 969 F.2d 1147, 1153 (D.C.Cir. 1992)). The EPA is not addressing the lead acid battery issue in this notice, but will
publish a separate notice in the 

Federal Register

 in the near future. 
Regarding the third issue, unlike the NSPS for new MWC's proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

, the proposed emission guidelines do not include any requirement for existing MWC's to prepare a materials separation
plan. However, the EPA is considering the option of adding this type of requirement to the emission guidelines at promulgation.
As defined in section 69.51b of the proposed NSPS (subpart Eb) included in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

, a materials separation plan would be a plan that identifies both a goal and an approach for a given MWC to separate certain
components of MSW for its service area in order to make the separated materials available for recycling. While the
current NSPS proposal does not require the adoption of any particular approach, various types of approaches that
the owner or operator of an MWC may choose to include in their materials separation plan are drop-off facilities, buy-back
or deposit-return incentives, curbside pick-up programs, or centralized mechanical separation. Refer to the proposed
NSPS in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

 for further discussion of the proposed material separation plan for new MWC's. 
As part of development of a materials separation plan, the owner or operator of an existing MWC would be required to
hold two public hearings for presentation of preliminary and final draft materials separation plans. The first public
meeting would present the opportunity for the existing facility and interested public from the service area to discuss,
among other issues, the types of materials separation approaches suited to the service area of the MWC. The second
public meeting would present the opportunity for the existing facility to present a plan to integrate approaches
discussed at the initial public meeting into the operation of the MWC (i.e., to discuss the effects of different types
of materials separation on the performance of the combustor). After each public meeting, the owner or operator would
be required to prepare and distribute documents responding to the public comments received at the public meetings.
The final materials separation plan would be submitted along with the report documenting the results of the initial
compliance test. Additionally, the owner or operator may be required to submit some form of annual report summarizing
the effectiveness of the materials separation plan and identifying any modifications made to the plan after implementation.
This last requirement has not yet been incorporated into the proposed NSPS materials separation requirements included
in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

; however, the EPA has specifically requested comment in that notice on the usefulness of this type of subsequent reporting
for assuring efficient application of the plan. 
The EPA requests comments on the appropriateness of including materials separation plan requirements in the emission
guidelines for existing MWC's. 
Regarding the fourth issue, the MWC regulations are complex, and the EPA expects to receive numerous comments on this
proposal. The EPA has specifically requested comments on items fundamental to the proposal, including but not limited
to the MACT floor, MACT performance levels, and a consideration of materials separation requirements for existing
MWC's.

A. Public Hearing 



A public hearing will be held 15 days following proposal. The hearing will be held at Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, and will start about 9:00 a.m. At the public hearing, the proposed standards will be discussed in accordance
with section 307(d)(5) of the Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations at the public hearing should contact
the EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a
written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be mailed to the
Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble. 

A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during
normal working hours at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center in Washington, DC (see 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble). 



B. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered in the development
of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify
and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the official
record in case of judicial review, except for interagency review material (section 307(d)(7)(A)). The docket number
for this rulemaking is A-90-45. Docket No. A-89-08 also includes background information
for this rulemaking that supported the proposal and promulgation of the subpart Ca emission guidelines. 



C. Clean Air Act Procedural Requirements 



The following procedural requirements of the Act are addressed: Administrative listing, periodic review, external
participation, and economic impact assessment. 



1. Administrative Listing_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act 



As prescribed by section 111 of the Act, establishment of emission guidelines for MWC's is based on the Administrator's
determination (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987) that these sources contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably
be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directs the Administrator
to promulgate guidelines for existing MWC's. 



2. Periodic Review_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act 



Sections 111 and 129 of the Act require that the guidelines be reviewed no later than 5 years following the initial promulgation.
At that time and at 5-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review the guidelines in accordance with
sections 111 and 129 of the Act and revise them if necessary. This review will include an assessment of such factors
as the need for integration with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements
in emission control technology, and reporting requirements. 



3. External Participation 



In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate
advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comments
on all aspects of the proposed guidelines, including economic and technological issues. 



4. Economic Impact Assessment 



Section 317A of the Act requires the EPA to prepare an economic impact assessment for any emission guidelines promulgated
under section 111(d) of the Act. An economic impact assessment was prepared for the proposed emission guidelines.
In the manner described in sections III, IV, and V of this preamble regarding the impacts of and rationale for the proposed
emission guidelines, the EPA considered all aspects of the economic impact assessment in proposing the emission
guidelines. The economic impact assessment is included in the list of key technical documents at the beginning of
today's notice under 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

. 



D. Executive Order 12866 Review 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and, therefore, subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines a ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule
that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; 

(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs, or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or 

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA considers these proposed guidelines to be ``significant''
because their annual effect on the economy would be expected to exceed $100 million. As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public
docket for this rulemaking.

E. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires Federal agencies to give special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small entities, which
are small businesses, small organizations, and small governments. The major purpose of the RFA is to keep paperwork
and regulatory requirements from getting out of proportion to the scale of the entities being regulated, without
compromising the objectives of, in this case, the Act. 

If a regulation is likely to have significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities, the EPA may
give special consideration to those small entities when analyzing regulatory alternatives and drafting the regulation.
In the case at hand, the EPA considers that a regulation that is likely to affect 20 percent or more of small entities
with MWC's is a regulation that will affect a substantial number of small entities. 

Definitions of small entities are flexible. For analysis of the guidelines being proposed today, the EPA considers
a small business in this industry to be one with gross annual revenue less than $6 million, and a small government to
be one that serves a population of less than 50,000. (A typical city of 50,000 generates about 90 Mg/day of MSW.) Most
small governments dispose of their MSW by landfilling and, therefore, will not be affected by regulation of MWC emissions.
In regard to small organizations such as independent not-for-profit enterprises, the EPA finds that they have no
more than a very minor involvement with MWC's, and for that reason the EPA has not found it necessary to study potential
direct impacts on small organizations. 

A limited number of MWC units exist that range in size upward from a capacity to combust less than 1 Mg/day of MSW to those
capable of combusting 35 Mg/day. The EPA estimates that MWC's under 35 Mg/day in capacity except for MWI's, which will
be regulated under a separate action, contribute a negligible fraction of total MWC emissions. Many MWC's under 35
Mg/day in capacity, and a few larger ones, are owned or operated by small entities. The EPA estimates that considerably
fewer than 20 percent of small-entity MWC's will be affected by the emission guidelines being proposed today. 

Thus, the number of affected small entities is not expected to be substantial, and a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required. Nevertheless, the EPA has conducted an extensive analysis of potential regulatory impacts on households,
small governments, and small businesses. The full analysis is included in the economic impact assessment in the docket
and listed at the beginning of today's notice under 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 

On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed standards and emission guidelines that applied to all sizes of MWC's. The proposal
had no lower size cutoff. Small businesses, small governments, and groups representing small-entity interests
commented extensively on the need to lighten the potential regulatory burden on small entities. Most commenters
suggested a small size cutoff considerably smaller than the one now being proposed. The most frequently suggested
levels were 5 to 11 Mg/day, 18 Mg/day, 23 Mg/day, and 45 Mg/day. The EPA has used these suggestions and the information
submitted by these commenters, as well as information from other sources, to fulfill the intent of the RFA. The EPA
has incorporated into the guidelines being proposed today several features that will mitigate, and in most cases
eliminate, any potentially adverse economic impacts on small entities. These features are as follows: 

(1) The emission guidelines will apply only to MWC's with a plant capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. This cutoff eliminates
from the purview of the guidelines the overwhelming majority of existing very small MWC's (There will be a one-time
requirement for MWC plants in the 25 to 35 Mg/day range to report for verification the capacities and locations of the
plants, but this paperwork will impose a very minor economic burden.); 

(2) The guidelines are ``tiered'' so that the stringency (and therefore potential economic burden) of the emission
guidelines increases as the size of the MWC plant increases. Plants with capacities of 25 to 35 Mg/day would have only
the one-time reporting of capacity and location. Plants with capacities of 35 to 225 Mg/day would have guidelines
for PM, opacity, dioxins/furans, SO

2

, HCl, Cd, Pb, Hg, operating practices, and operator training and certification. Additionally, small MWC plants
would be required to perform compliance testing, but the guidelines and compliance testing requirements would not
be as stringent as those for plants larger than 225 Mg/day. Furthermore, the plants would not be required to control
NO

X

. Plants with capacities above 225 Mg/day would be subject to guidelines for NO

X

 in addition to all other pollutants, and compliance testing would be required more frequently; 

(3) The emission guidelines consist of emission limits, as opposed to design, equipment, work practice, or operational
standards. Emission limits give MWC owners and operators the freedom to select the most economical means of reducing
emissions; and 

(4) The emission guidelines are not the usual type of regulation governed by the RFA. The guidelines will not apply
directly to any MWC's, but will be used as a guide by individual State air pollution control agencies in developing
site-specific regulations for MWC's. States are allowed some flexibility in implementing the guidelines. Pursuant
to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA certifies that these proposed emission guidelines, if promulgated,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the number of small
entities affected is not substantial.

F. Executive Order 12875 



Under Executive Order 12875, the EPA is required to consult with representatives of affected State, local, and tribal
governments, and keep these affected parties informed about the content and effect of the proposed standards. The
following discussion provides a brief summary of the content, need for, and cost of the proposal, as well as the actions
that the EPA has taken to communicate and consult with the affected parties. 



1. Summary of the Proposed Guidelines 



The proposed emission guidelines would establish emission limitations for existing MWC units located at MWC plants
with plant capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW. The proposed guidelines do not specify which type of
air pollution control equipment must be used at MWC's to meet the proposed emission limitations. The EPA expects,
however, that, as a result of the proposal, most large MWC plants (plants with greater than 225 Mg/day capacity) would
retrofit scrubbing systems (SD/ESP) for dioxins/furans, metals, and acid gas control and SNCR for NO

X

 control. Small MWC plants (plants with 35 to 225 Mg/day capacity) would be expected to install scrubbing systems (DSI/ESP),
but SNCR technology would not be necessary. Refer to section II of this preamble for a more detailed discussion of the
proposed guidelines. 



2. Need for the Proposed Guidelines 



Under the Act Amendments of 1990, section 129 includes a schedule that requires the EPA to adopt the emission guidelines
for large and small MWC plants by the end of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The EPA did not comply with that schedule and
is now under court order to propose the emission guidelines by September 1, 1994 and promulgate the emission guidelines
by September 1, 1995. As required by section 129, the proposed emission guidelines would establish guideline emission
levels for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, PM, and opacity), MWC acid gases (HCl and SO

2

), and NO

X

. See section I of this preamble for further discussion of the regulatory history and general goals of the proposed
guidelines. 



3. Cost of the Proposal 



The national cost of the proposed guidelines would be about $445 million per year. More than 40 percent of all existing
MWC capacity subject to this proposal has already installed acid gas/PM control systems. The retrofit cost of the
air pollution control system for an individual combustor subject to the proposed guidelines will vary depending
on the plant size and difficulty of the retrofit. The average annualized retrofit cost of the proposed guidelines
for a typical large MWC plant requiring retrofit would be about $4.1 million per year. The average annualized retrofit
cost of the proposed guidelines for a typical small MWC plant requiring retrofit would be about $0.9 million per year.
Tipping fees at combustors currently average about $57/Mg of MSW combusted. For those MWC plants that would require
an air pollution control retrofit as a result of the proposal, the tipping fees would typically increase by $17 to $28/Mg,
with the lower cost being for large MWC plants and the higher cost being for small MWC plants. Regarding the impact of
the proposed guidelines directly or indirectly on households, the EPA projects an increase in the household cost
of waste disposal of about $22 to $26 per year or about $2 per month for communities that have MWC's. Refer to section
III.D of this preamble for a more complete summary of the cost and economic impacts of the proposed guidelines, on both
national and plant-specific bases. 



4. Communication With Affected Parties 



As previously mentioned, Executive Order 12875 requires the EPA to consult with representatives of affected State,
local, and tribal governments, and prior to promulgation of final standards, summarize concerns of the governmental
entities and respond to their comments. The EPA has already initiated consultations with numerous governmental
entities including, but not limited to, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National
Association of Counties, the Municipal Waste Management Association, and the Solid Waste Association of North America.

Withdrawal of the 1991 Emission Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed withdrawal of 1991 emission guidelines (subpart Ca) and request for comment.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to withdraw the emission guidelines for existing municipal waste combustors (MWC's) that were promulgated
on February 11, 1991 in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ca. The February 11, 1991 subpart Ca emission guidelines for MWC's would
be replaced by more stringent guidelines being proposed under section 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990
(1990 Amendments). New emission guidelines that would replace those being proposed to be withdrawn in this document
are being proposed in a separate document in today's 

Federal Register

.

Summary of Proposed Withdrawal of the 1991 Emission Guidelines (Subpart Ca) 



On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed emission guidelines for all sizes of existing MWC's (54 FR 52209). Those proposed
guidelines were developed under section 111(d) of the Act as amended in 1977 and were promulgated on February 11, 1991.
Section 111(d) of the Act of 1977 requires emission guidelines for designated existing sources of air pollution to
reflect the application of best demonstrated technology (BDT). 

On November 15, 1990, just prior to the EPA's scheduled promulgation of the section 111(d) guidelines, the Act Amendments
of 1990 were adopted. The 1990 Amendments added a new section 129 to the Act that applies to solid waste combustors including
MWC's. Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA is required to promulgate revised guidelines
for MWC's based upon the application of maximum achievable control technology (MACT). However, section 129 included
a clause that directed the EPA to issue the emission guidelines developed based on BDT under the deadlines imposed
in the consent decree issued from 

State of New York et al. 

v. 

Reilly

 (No. 89-1729 D.D.C.). Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directed the EPA to limit applicability of
BDT-based guidelines to those MWC's with a unit capacity greater than 225 Mg/day (250 tons per day). Section 129 specified
that revised MACT-based guidelines for units larger than 225 Mg/day capacity were to be adopted by the EPA within 1
year and that revised MACT-based guidelines for units smaller than 225 Mg/day were to be adopted within 2 years. Consistent
with section 129, the EPA redrafted the BDT-based guidelines and limited applicability of the 1991 guidelines to
MWC units larger than 225 Mg/day capacity. 

In a separate document in today's 

Federal Register

, the EPA is proposing emission guidelines for MWC's that reflect the application of MACT as required by section 129.
The proposed MACT-based guidelines are more stringent than the February 11, 1991 BDT-based guidelines and would
apply to MWC units at plants with a capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. The MACT-based guidelines would require MWC
facilities to purchase and install different types of air pollution control equipment than the BDT-based guidelines.
Therefore, the EPA proposes to withdraw the February 11, 1991 guidelines since their implementation would not be
consistent with the MACT requirements of section 129. The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines were promulgated
in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ca. The MACT-based guidelines proposed in a separate document in today's 

Federal Register

 are proposed as 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb. This notice proposes to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines.

Methods 29 and 101A Item in EMTIC Electronic Bulletin Board 


1. ``Emissions Test Method 29: Determination of Metals Emissions From Stationary Sources (1994 Proposal),'' EPA-454/R-94-016,
April 1994. 


I. Summary of Proposed Method 29 and Method 101A Revisions 


Under Subparts Ca and Ea, the EPA is proposing guidelines and standards to regulate mercury, cadmium, and lead emissions
from MWC's. Method 29 is being proposed for addition to Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 and will serve as the compliance test
method for MWC's for mercury, cadmium, and lead. Method 29 is applicable to the determination of antimony (Sb), arsenic
(As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn),
mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium (Tl), and zinc (Zn) emissions from
stationary sources. Method 29 may be used to determine particulate emissions in addition to the metals emissions
if the prescribed procedures and precautions are followed. For both methods, a stack sample is withdrawn isokinetically
from the source, particulate emissions are collected in the probe and on a heated filter, and gaseous emissions are
then collected in an aqueous acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide (analyzed for all metals including Hg) and an aqueous
acidic solution of potassium permanganate (analyzed only for Hg). The recovered samples are digested, and appropriate
fractions are analyzed for Hg by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS) and for Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co,
Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, P, Se, Ag, Tl, and Zn by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICAP) or atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS). Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) is used for analysis of Sb, As, Cd,
Co, Pb, Se, and Tl if these elements require greater analytical sensitivity than can be obtained by ICAP. Additionally,
if desired, the tester may use AAS for analysis of all listed metals if the resulting in-stack method detection limits
meet the goal of the testing program. Mercury emissions can be measured, alternatively, using EPA Method 101A of appendix
B, 40 CFR part 61. Method 101-A measures only Hg but it can be of special interest to sources which need to measure
both Hg and Mn emissions. Amendments to Method 101A of appendix B of part 61 are being proposed to provide consistency
with Method 29. 



II. Administrative Requirements 


A. Public Hearing 


A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rule in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the
Clean Air Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should contact the EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a

(OMB) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 
2. 

Executive Order 12866 review.

 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to the OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: 
1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities; 
2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA does not consider this action to be significant because it does
not involve any of the above mentioned items. 


D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

Proposed Flood Elevation Determinations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
(100-year) flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations
and modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 



These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings. 



National Environmental Policy Act.

 This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. 



Regulatory Classification.

 This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism.

 This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

 This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 The United States Fire Administration (FEMA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would identify the eligibility criteria and procedures for States or consortia of States to apply
for arson related grants, if funds are appropriated to support this activity. The proposed rule would detail the evaluation
criteria and anti-arson goals that the awards are targeted to support. The intent of this proposed rule is to notify
interested parties how FEMA intends to administer this program, and to invite comments on the proposed procedures.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Arson Prevention Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-254) amends the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C.
2220) to authorize competitive grants to States or consortia of States, for programs relating to arson research,
prevention, and control. In anticipation of appropriations being made to fund the authorized grants, and contingent
upon the availability of appropriations, FEMA is publishing proposed rules to indicate how it would administer the
grant program. 



National Environmental Policy Act



This proposed rule is excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration, as having minimal

Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the proposed rule would relate to
the procedures that FEMA would follow to administer a statutorily mandated grant program, and would have no direct
effect on small business or governmental entities. The proposed rule is not expected (1) To affect adversely the availability
of grants to small entities, (2) to have significant secondary or incidental effects on a substantial number of small
entities, nor (3) to create and additional burden on small entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis
has been prepared. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



This proposed rule does not involve any collection of information for the purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.




Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review



Promulgation of this proposed rule is required by statute, 15 U.S.C. 2221 et seq. To the extent possible under the statutory
requirements of 15 U.S.C. 2221 et seq. this proposed rule adheres to the principles of regulation set forth in this
Executive Order. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform



This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

State qualification criteria. 



Each State or consortium of States will demonstrate by appropriate means and provide such assurances as are deemed
adequate by the Administrator that the State, or consortium of States: 

(a) Will obtain at least 25 percent of the cost(s) funded by the grant, in cash or in kind, from non-Federal sources.

(1) State's contribution. Applicants will identify the source and amount of their respective contribution (in cash
or in kind) in the work plan and budget detail sections of the application. 
(2) Cash contributions will be sourced or certified by responsible authority to be derived entirely from non-Federal
sources. 
(3) In kind contributions will be specifically detailed and clearly demonstrate the type, nature, value and quantity
of the contribution offered to satisfy this requirement. The applicant(s) may offer current staff in support of the
contribution requirement, in so far as the offering would not effect the restriction against decreasing the prior
levels of spending detailed in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(4) In kind contributions will also be sourced and certified to be derived from non-Federal sources. 
(b) Will not as a result of receiving the grant decrease the prior level of spending of funds of the State or consortium
from non-federal sources for arson research, prevention, and control programs. The applicant(s) will provide a
concise overview of the level of funding dedicated to these areas for each of the two previous fiscal years. This information
will be included in the grant file and is subject to post audit reviews. The applicant's responsible official will
provide appropriate certification that the recipient is cognizant of this condition of award, and that no diminution
of funding is to result in such anti-arson efforts in the event of a grant award. Violation of this grant award condition
may subject the recipient to termination of the grant, and forfeiture of unused portions of grant funds, and other
applicable administrative or criminal sanctions. 
(c) Will use no more than 10 percent of the funds provided under the grant for administrative costs of the programs.
Actual administrative cost incurred, not to exceed 10 percent for the funds provided, may be funded through the grant.
It is recognized that the administrative costs may exceed the allocation limit, in such cases the additional expense
will be born by the recipient. Excess administrative costs will 

not

 be considered part of the recipients required ``contribution'' as noted in paragraph (a) of this section; and 
(d) Is making efforts to ensure that all local jurisdictions will provide arson data to the National Fire Incident
Reporting System (NFIRS) or the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. 
(1) The State, or consortia of States, will provide, as part of the application process, such information as will describe
its current efforts to ensure that all local jurisdictions will provide data to NFIRS or UCR. 
(2) This description should include the current level of local jurisdiction participation in each of the respective
data collection programs. It should detail the State's reporting criteria, and data collection requirements, and
statutory reporting mandates, if applicable. It should specifically identify the constructive efforts (both incentives
and penalties to local jurisdiction's participation) underway to achieve complete reporting, and identify the
actions, if any, to be taken under the proposed grant to achieve the participation target; and 
(e) Has a policy to promote actively the training of its firefighters in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The
applicant(s) may demonstrate their fulfillment of this requirement by providing a true copy of the policy with the
proposal, or by such other means as would reasonably attest to the applicant's active promotion of CPR training for
all firefighters.
