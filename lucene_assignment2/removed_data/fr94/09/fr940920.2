<DOCTITLE>Investment Plans Survey</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of the Census, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of termination and consideration.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census is 
proposing to replace the quarterly Plant and Equipment (P&E) 
Survey with a new semiannual Investment Plans Survey (IPS). 
Capital investments by businesses are a key indicator of U.S. 
economic performance. This change would improve the quality of 
intrayear data on U.S. business investment and provide 
comparability between intrayear investment surveys and the more 
detailed Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES).


The P&E Survey was terminated after second quarter 1994 P&E 
results were released on September 8, 1994. Results for the 
first phase of the new IPS would be released in February 1995 and 
would include preliminary estimates of total 1994 expenditures 
for structures and equipment and planned 1995 spending for 
selected industry categories. Results for the second phase would 
be released in September 1995 and would include revised estimates 
of planned 1995 spending. The IPS results for future years would 
be released on this semiannual schedule.
The IPS methods and content have been coordinated with those 
of the ACES and results from this new indicator survey will be 
fully consistent with results from the ACES. However, because 
the scope and detail of the new IPS are different from the 
present P&E Survey, IPS results will not be directly comparable to previously released P&E Survey data.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed survey was submitted to 
the Office of Management and Budget on July 18, 1994 for approval 
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96-511, as amended. This was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1994. Copies of the material submitted are made available on request to the Director, Bureau of the Census,
Washington, D.C. 20233.

Grant of Authority for Subzone Status, Peavey Electronics Corporation (Electronic Audio and Acoustical Products),
Meridian, MS, Area


Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order:


Whereas, 

by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment * * * of foreign-trade
zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for other purposes,''
as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized to grant to
qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs ports of
entry; 


Whereas, 

the Board's regulations (15 CFR Part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when existing
zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 


Whereas, 

an application from the Vicksburg/Jackson Foreign Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 158, for authority
to establish special-purpose subzone status at the electronic audio and acoustical products manufacturing facilities
(9 sites) of the Peavey Electronics Corporation in the Meridian, Mississippi, area, was filed by the Board on August
19, 1993, and notice inviting public comment was given in the 

Federal Register

 (FTZ Docket 47-93, 58 FR 46627, 9-2-93); and, 


Whereas, 

the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval of
the application is in the public interest; 
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 158B) at the plant sites of the
Peavey Electronics Corporation in the Meridian,

 Mississippi, area, at the locations described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations,
including  400.28.

The Department also instructed four of the respondents (Agrorosas S.A.; Flores Mocari S.A.; Grupo Andes; and Rosex
LTDA) to report CV as the basis for FMV as the volume of sales in neither the home market nor third countries was adequate.

On June 29, 1994, one of the four respondents in the second category above, Grupo Sagaro, submitted an amendment to
its questionnaire response. In that amendment, Grupo Sagaro stated that, based on further review, it did have a viable
home market. After reviewing the new sales information, the Department agreed and on July 8, 1994, we instructed Grupo
Sagaro to base its FMV on home market sales.

Respondents submitted responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in May and July 1994. The Department
issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June, July, August and September 1994. Respondents submitted
their responses to these deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June and August 1994. Agricola Benilda submitted
a comprehensive revision of its sales and cost information on September 8, 1994. Agrorosas S.A. submitted minor pre-verification
corrections on September 9, 1994.

On July 5, 1994, petitioner requested that the Department reject home market sales as a basis for FMV for nine of the
respondents for which the home market was viable. Petitioner stated that these sales were not in the ordinary course
of trade. On July 11, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to determine if the sales reported
were in the ordinary course of trade. On July 25, 1994, the respondents provided their responses to these supplemental
questionnaires.

On July 28, 1994, petitioner alleged that the nine respondents which had viable home markets sold roses in the home
market at prices below their cost of production (COP). Petitioner also alleged that Grupo Tropicales sold roses in
one of its two third country markets, Argentina, at prices below its COP.

On August 22, 1994, the Department instructed Rosex to file a consolidated response with Rosas Sausalito and Induflora.
This response is due on September 12, 1994. For our preliminary determination we based our analysis on only Rosex's
data.

On September 8, 1994, the Department initiated COP investigations against the nine respondents with viable home
markets and against Argentine sales for Grupo Tropicales (

See

 the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

Based on information obtained from the respondents which had viable home markets, the Department determined on September
9, 1994, that home market sales were in the ordinary course of trade and, therefore, could be used in the Department's
analysis (

See

 the September 9, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).

On September 12, 1994, the Department decided to base FMV for Grupo Clavecol, Grupo Sabana and Grupo Tropicales on
third country sales (

See

 the September 12, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). For a further discussion, see the ``Third
Country Sales'' section of this notice.



Scope of Investigation



The products covered by this investigation are fresh cut roses, including sweethearts or miniatures, intermediates,
and hybrid teas, whether imported as individual blooms (stems) or in bouquets or bunches. Roses are classifiable
under subheadings 0603.10.6010 and 0603.10.6090 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 

(

HTSUS

). The 

HTSUS

 subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this investigation
is dispositive.



Period of Investigation



The Department initiated this investigation using our standard six-month POI from September 1, 1993, to February
28, 1994. On March 30 and April 11, respondents submitted comments on the POI. On April 5, 1994, petitioner also submitted
comments on the POI. On April 14, 1994, the Department altered the POI to calendar year 1993 because of the seasonal
nature of sales and production in the rose industry (

See

 the April 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Richard W. Moreland).

In addition, for purposes of price-to-price comparisons, we are basing FMV on two six-month periods: January 1, 1993,
through June 30, 1993; and July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. For a further discussion of these periods, see the
September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum.



Best Information Available



We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA)
is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise by the following respondents: (1) Agricola Benilda; (2) Grupo
Intercontinental; (3) Grupo Prisma and (4) Grupo Andes.

In assigning BIA, the Department applies a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of respondent's cooperation.
In the first tier, the Department normally assigns higher margins (

i.e., 

margins based on more adverse assumptions) for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation or which
otherwise impeded the proceeding. If a respondent is deemed non-cooperative, the Department bases the preliminary
margin for the relevant class or kind of merchandise on the higher of: (1) The highest margin in the petition or (2) the
highest calculated margin of any respondent within that country that supplied adequate responses for the relevant
class or kind of merchandise.

In the second tier, the Department assigns lower margins to those respondents who substantially cooperate in an investigation.
These margins are based on the higher of: (1) The highest calculated margin for any respondent within the country that
supplied adequate information for the relevant class or kind of merchandise or (2) the average margin of the margins
in the petition (

See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller
Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 

(54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989)).

<PARENT> FR940920-2-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department's two-tiered methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (

See Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 

See also Krupp Stahl AG 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)).
For Agricola Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental and Grupo Prisma, we have determined that these respondents' original
and deficiency questionnaire responses were unusable for the preliminary determination because they contained
significant deficiencies (

See 

the September 12, 1994, memorandum from David L. Binder to Barbara R. Stafford). In addition, Agricola Benilda submitted
substantial revisions to its sales and cost information on September 8, 1994.
However, because Agricola Benilda, Grupo Andes, Grupo Intercontinental and Grupo Prisma responded to our requests
for information, we find that these respondents have been substantially cooperative for purposes of this preliminary
determination. Accordingly, we used as second-tier BIA for these respondents the average of the margins contained
in the petition, which is 55.94 percent. This margin is higher than the highest margin calculated for any respondent
in this investigation.
Furthermore, we have issued supplemental deficiency letters to Agricola Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental and Grupo
Prisma. If these respondents submit adequate and timely responses to these letters, we will conduct verification
for these respondents and will consider their information for purposes of the final determination.
For Grupo Andes, we have determined that this respondent has failed to respond adequately to the Department's deficiency
questionnaire and failed to inform the Department in a timely manner that it had sufficient sales of export-quality
roses in the home market to deem the home market viable. While Grupo Andes stated that its home market was not viable,
analysis of its deficiency response has indicated that its home market is, in fact, viable.
Grupo Andes' failure to correctly indicate that its home market was, in fact, viable constitutes a material error:
the determination of what basis in which to make price comparisons is central to the entire dumping analysis.
While Andes has substantially cooperated in this investigation, the history of its responses indicates that the
information reported was highly unreliable, and its failure to report home market sales was a fundamental error.
Because of the serious errors in Andes' reporting, we would have needed a materially new response. We find that there
is insufficient time prior to verification in which to analyze such a response and any possible supplemental responses.
For these reasons we will not be conducting verification for this respondent and will also base the margin for Grupo
Andes in the final determination on cooperative BIA (

See 

the September 9, 1994, memorandum from David L. Binder to Barbara R. Stafford).


Such or Similar Comparisons


We have determined that all roses covered by this investigation comprise two categories of ``such or similar'' merchandise:
culls and export-quality roses. None of the respondents reported sales of culls in the United States. Therefore,
no comparisons in this such or similar category were made. Regarding export quality roses, where possible, we made
comparisons of identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market or third
country market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of: (1) Form (

e.g., 

as part of a bouquet, an individual stem, etc.); (2) type (

e.g., 

hybrid tea, sweetheart, etc.); (3) color; (4) stem length; and (5) variety. We did not make any adjustments for differences
in the physical characteristics of the merchandise because respondents reported no cost differences between the
products.


Fair Value Comparisons


To determine whether sales of roses from Colombia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the FMV for all non-BIA respondents, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and
``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.


United States Price


For sales by all non-BIA respondents except Floramerica, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section
772(b) of the Act, when the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation
and when exporter's sales price (ESP) methodology was not otherwise indicated.
In addition, for all non-BIA respondents, where sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation
into the United States, we based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act.
For all U.S. prices, we used weighted-average monthly U.S. prices (

See 

the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).
During the POI, some of the respondents paid commissions to related parties in the United States. We determined that
these commissions were directly related to the sales under consideration. We also tested these commissions for these
respondents to determine whether they were paid at arm's length using the criteria set forth in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium (56 FR 56359, November 4, 1991). Where we found
that they were paid at arm's length, we deducted them from USP. However, we found that respondents used these commissions
as a mechanism for reimbursing their related parties for their actual expenses. Accordingly, in order to avoid double-counting,
where the actual expenses of the related party were less than the commissions, we deducted only the commissions. Where
the commissions were less than the actual expenses, we also deducted the amount by which the actual expenses exceeded
the commissions (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).

<TEXT>
 

Finally, for those respondents who had related parties in the United States and did not report inventory carrying
costs on their ESP sales, we calculated these costs for these respondents using an inventory carrying period of seven
days. This is the maximum amount of time which may transpire between the time a rose is cut and when it must be sold to the
ultimate customer, according to a public report by Harry K. Tayama, PhD., submitted by respondents in this investigation.
For companies with sales to unrelated parties, we accepted that inventory carrying costs were included in U.S. credit
expenses.
We made company-specific adjustments, as discussed below:


1. Agrorosas S.A.


For Agrorosas, U.S. purchase price was based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United States.

reported interest rate, we used the highest public interest rate on the record in the companion investigation of roses
from Ecuador which is a ranged value for a U.S. subsidiary of an Ecuadoran rose producer, Guaisa, of 10 percent (

See 

the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum and the September 9, 1994, memorandum to the file).

We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. 
We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. import duties, brokerage and handling and credit expenses. 


Foreign Market Value 


In calculating FMV, wherever there were no sales of comparable merchandise in the home market or third country markets,
we based FMV on CV. In addition, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, for price to price comparisons, we compared U.S. sales
to home market or third country sales made at the same level of trade, where possible. 
We have three different bases for FMV: (1) Home market sales; (2) third country sales; and (3) constructed value. Each
is discussed separately below: 


Home Market Sales 


In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of export quality roses to the volume of third country
sales of export quality roses in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined
that nine of the 16 respondents had viable home markets. The nine companies were: Agricola Benilda; Flores La Fragancia
S.A.; Grupo Bojaca; Caicedo Group; Grupo Floramerica; Grupo Intercontinental; Grupo Papagayo; Grupo Prisma and
Grupo Sagaro. However, we did not use home market sales for Agricola Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental, Grupo Prisma
or Grupo Andes because we based the margin for these companies on BIA. In addition, we based Grupo Andes' margin on BIA
because we found that it had misrepresented its home market as nonviable (

See

 the ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice for a further discussion). 
Because petitioner's allegations, when considered in light of the information on the record, gave the Department
``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that the nine respondents with known viable home markets were selling
roses in Colombia at prices below their COP, the Department initiated COP investigations to determine whether these
respondents had home market sales that were made at less than their respective COPs (

See

 the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Respondents requested that we
depart from our normal practice and interpret our COP analysis in such a manner as to either accept or reject all sales.
We denied this request as unreasonable (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). 
In keeping with our past practice involving perishable agricultural products where we found less than 50 percent
of a respondent's sales of roses were at prices below the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined
that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities (

See Certain Fresh Winter Vegetables From Mexico

 45 FR 20512 (1980)). Where we found between 50 and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices
below the COP, and the below cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we disregarded only the below-cost
sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were at prices below the COP, and the sales were
made over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that product and calculated FMV based on CV. 
In order to determine whether home market prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of a respondent's
cost of cultivation, general expenses, and packing. We calculated CV based on the sum of a respondent's cost of cultivation,
plus general expenses, profit and U.S. packing. For general expenses, which includes selling and financial expenses
(SG&A), we used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost
of cultivation. For profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average third country profit during the POI or the
statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with section 773(e)(B)
of the Act. 
For all respondents, we corrected the calculation of interest expense for COP to remove the offset to this expense.
This reduction to interest expense is only applicable for CV calculations. Interest expense for all respondents
was corrected to a per-unit amount. Further, for all respondents we based the amortization expense upon the amounts
normally recorded by each company in its usual record keeping. We rejected adjustments that companies made to the
amortization expense solely for purposes of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to respondents'
COP and CV data as described below: 


1. Flores La Fragancia S.A. 


For Flores La Fragancia S.A., we: (1) Corrected the calculation of greenhouse plastic amortization to reflect the
methodology normally used by the company; (2) corrected the reported ``material for greenhouse frames'' to agree
with the underlying schedules provided in the response; (3) corrected the reported net financing costs to agree to
the underlying schedules; and (4) corrected for a mathematical error in the calculation of SG&A expenses. 


2. Grupo Bojaca 


For Grupo Bojaca, we corrected the reported general and administrative (G&A) expense amount to reflect the amount
reported in the company's financial statement. 


3. Caicedo Group

<TEXT>
 

For Caicedo Group, we included the expenses associated with a freeze which occurred during the POI, and removed the
effect of erroneous crop adjustment amounts (

i.e.,

 capitalizing more costs than the total accumulated amount) reported in the COP calculation. 


4. Grupo Papagayo 


For Grupo Papagayo, we removed the effect of erroneous crop adjustment amounts (

i.e.,

 capitalizing more costs than the total accumulated amount) reported in the COP calculation. 
In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as described below: 


1. Flores La Fragancia S.A. 


For Flores La Fragancia S.A., we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market.


For home market price to purchase price comparisons, pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2),
we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted home market packing
costs and added U.S. packing costs. 
For home market price to ESP comparisons, we deducted the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses,
including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions
or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.

For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.

For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the
weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of
the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with
19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


2. Grupo Bojaca 


For Grupo Bojaca, more than 90 percent of Grupo Bojaca's home market sales were found to be at prices below their COP.
Therefore, in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act we disregarded all home market sales and calculated FMV based
on CV. 
For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.

For CV to ESP comparisons, we deducted the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including, where
appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


3. Caicedo Group 


For Caicedo Group, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We excluded
from our analysis home market sales that were ultimately exported. 
For home market price to purchase price comparisons, pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2),
we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses and CFC fee. We deducted home market
packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. 
For home market price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted
the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying
costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. 
For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses
and CFC fee. 
For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the
weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of
the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with
19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 
For comparisons involving ESP sales, we revised U.S.-incurred indirect selling expense to: (a) Include sales to
local vendors in the calculation of the indirect selling expense ratio and (b) deduct U.S. inland freight expenses
that were reported as indirect selling expenses. 


4. Grupo Floramerica 


For Grupo Floramerica, more than 90 percent of Grupo Floramerica's home market sales were found to be at prices below
their COP. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act we disregarded all home market sales and calculated
FMV based on CV. 
For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the
weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred
on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


5. Grupo Papagayo 


For Grupo Papagayo, more than 90 percent of its home market sales were found to be at prices below their COP. Therefore,
we disregarded all home market sales and calculated FMV based on CV. 
Due to the deficiencies found in respondent's reported home market sales data, we disallowed home market inland freight,
packing costs, indirect selling expenses, and imputed credit from the dumping margin calculation for purposes of
the preliminary determination. 
On September 9, 1994, Agrorosas submitted a letter containing some pre-verification corrections pertaining to
its sales and cost data. Given the limited time available to the Department to examine the newly submitted information,
this information is not used in the preliminary determination dumping margin. However, the newly submitted information
will be subject to verification and will be considered in the final determination of this investigation. 
For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstances of sales adjustment for direct selling. We also added
U.S. commissions. 
No deductions were made for CV to ESP comparisons due to disallowing home market indirect selling expenses from the
margin calculation. 


6. Grupo Sagaro 


For Grupo Sagaro, more than 90 percent of its home market sales were found to be at prices below their COP. Therefore,
in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act we disregarded all home market sales and calculated FMV based on CV. 
For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.

For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses and commissions. We also deducted
from CV the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of indirect selling expenses
incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 


Third Country Versus Constructed Value 


On March 30, 1994, counsel for 14 of the 16 respondents requested that the Department reject third-country sales and
rely instead on constructed value as the basis for FMV.

The Department's normal preference, based on its regulations, is to utilize third-country sales rather than constructed
value when there is a viable third country market. See 19 CFR 353.48(b). Respondents have urged departure from this
practice, citing 

Certain Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review

 55 FR 20491 (May 17, 1990)(

Flowers

). The Department determined in 

Flowers

 that departure from our normal practice was warranted after an analysis of three unusual factors present in that case.
Respondents argue that the facts in this investigation present even more compelling reasons to reject third-country
sales than were present in 

Flowers.

 In determining whether the circumstances in this case are such that it should fall under the exception established
in 

Flowers,

 we have analyzed the information presented in light of the three factors set forth in 

Flowers:

 (1) Negative correlation of price and volume movements between markets; (2) peak to non-peak comparisons; and (3)
the perishability of the subject merchandise. 
As a threshold matter, we note that the record in this case is different from 

Flowers

 in that European markets play a relatively less important role in our analysis. In 

Flowers,

 the Department's analysis focused solely on a comparison of the U.S. market with European markets as the vast majority
of third country markets under consideration were in Europe. The Department did not evaluate conditions in other
markets. In this case, and the companion investigation in Ecuador, respondents reported significant sales to Argentina
and Canada, as well as Europe. Respondents in this case have submitted additional information for all the relevant
markets_Europe, Canada, and Argentina. However, it is not clear that the information submitted up to this point supports
respondents' assertion that sales in the third country markets should not be compared to U.S. sales in this case. 


Negative Correlation Factor 


In 

Flowers,

 the Department found a negative correlation between price and volume movements in the United States and European
markets. This negative correlation indicated that price differences between markets could either mask or exaggerate
dumping. The Department determined that the negative correlation was caused by a number of elements, including:
(1) The greater price and volume volatility of the U.S. market; (2) the sporadic, gift-giving nature of U.S. demand;
(3) respondents' lack of access to the European auctions (the main distribution point for flowers in Europe), and
(4) differing peak price periods. 
Respondents argue that, in this case, there is similar evidence of a negative correlation of price and volume movements
between the U.S. and third country markets. In support of their position, respondents have submitted several reports.
A 1994 report by Professor Tayama analyzes, among other things, the consumption patterns for roses in the United States,
Europe, Canada and Argentina, and compares seasonal and holiday purchasing patterns in the markets. Tayama asserts
that both Europe and Canada have mature and relatively stable markets because both markets are supply driven (

i.e.,

 in times of peak production as supply increases, prices go down). In contrast, Tayama claims that' the U.S. market
is demand driven_the majority of sales are made for Valentine's Day when demand increases and prices rise. With regard
to Argentina, Tayama states that roses are grown for home consumption and imports occur mainly during the winter months,
as in Europe. Moreover, Tayama asserts, Argentina has a different seasonal and holiday pattern from the United States.
No market, he states, has the extraordinary demand for roses that exists in the U.S. market on Valentine`s Day. 
Petitioners have countered Tayama's assertions with an August 10, 1994, submission which contains, among other
things, a report by 

Roses Inc.,

 an association of U.S. rose producers. The 

Roses Inc.

 report raises questions about the conclusions in the Tayama report, asserting that: 1) there is a global market for
roses which is driven by demand everywhere; and 2) key holiday periods are actually very similar between the United
States and Europe_specifically that the highest prices in both the United States and Europe occur in February. Thus,
we are not in a position to conclude that the Tayama report provides a sufficient basis to determine that comparison
of U.S. sales to third country sales is inappropriate. 
In support of the conclusions drawn in the Tayama report, respondents submitted the 1994 

Fresh Cut Roses: Issues in the Estimation of Dumping in the U.S. Market 

(Botero Report) which contains a statistical analysis of the United States, European, and Canadian markets and seeks
to demonstrate the lack of correlation between price movements in the third country and U.S. markets. The Botero Report
provides three types of statistical analyses which, according to respondents, support their contention that third
country prices should not be used due to the ``different equilibrium conditions'' of these markets as compared to
the U.S. market for roses. First, Botero analyzes price movements within the United States, Europe and Canada, from
which he concludes that different market forces are at work (

i.e.,

 price and quantity movements within Europe and Canada are negatively correlated and price and quantity movements
within the United States are positively correlated). Second, Botero analyzes price and quantity movements across
markets and concludes that there is no correlation between the U.S. market and either the European or Canadian markets.
Third, he estimates the price cycles for roses in the U.S., European and Canadian markets and concludes that ``the
seasonal patterns of the two markets [U.S. and European, U.S. and Canadian] are different and therefore monthly price
comparisons do not reflect price discrimination.'' Botero asserts that these test results demonstrate that prices
in these third country markets should not be compared to prices in the U.S. market to determine price discrimination.

We have reviewed the Botero Report and have concerns regarding the data and the statistical parameters used to perform
the statistical analysis on European, Canadian and U.S. rose prices. For example, Dr. Botero's relied on prices that
may not be comparable. U.S. prices for a single hybrid tea variety rose were compared to European prices for all hybrid
tea variety roses; and U.S. import prices, rather than U.S. domestic prices, were compared to European domestic prices.
These comparisons may be inappropriate_we have no basis to conclude that a single hybrid tea rose is representative
of all hybrid tea roses, or that U.S. import prices are representative of U.S. domestic prices. Moreover, Dr. Botero's
F-test results appear to be invalid. Dr. Botero apparently used the incorrect degrees of freedom_(k,n-2) instead
of (k-1,n-2). More importantly, Dr. Botero appears to have misread the ``F Table'': he reported the value
of F

n-2,k

 at the 99 percent confidence level, rather than F

k-1,n-2

 at the 99 percent confidence level. Finally, Dr. Botero provided no explanation of his use of a 99 percent confidence
level. 
In light of these questions, the Department, at this stage, finds the information on the record inconclusive as to
whether the third country and U.S. markets are negatively correlated. We intend to further evaluate the Botero Report
for purposes of making our final determination. Further details relating to this issue are set forth in the September
12, 1994, memorandum to Barbara Stafford. 


Peak to Non-Peak Factor 


Third country sales in 

Flowers

 were not made over the entire year. They were made only in peak months. The record established that Colombian growers
had little access to the European auction system and were only able to export flowers to Europe during those months
when domestic supply was low. On the other hand, the Colombian growers targeted 80 percent of their production to the
U.S. market and made sales to the United States in every month. As a result, the Department determined that it was unable
to make contemporaneous sales comparisons in all months and would be required to compare low-value U.S. sales in off-peak
months with high-value third country sales in peak months. 
The circumstances on the record in this case are somewhat different. One of the three companies reporting third country
sales has year-round sales to a single third country market, while the other two companies have third country sales
in every month in the markets selected by the Department pursuant to  353.49(c). Therefore, it appears that
the Department may have sufficient contemporaneous sales in the aggregate for all twelve months of the POI. Further,
the Department has based FMV on two six-month averages; the use of such averages also should reduce any potential for
distortion. 


Perishability Factor 


The third factor considered in 

Flowers

 was related to the role of perishability on production and sale. This factor included: (1) The extreme perishability
of the subject merchandise; (2) the inability of producers to control short-term production; and (3) the inability
to store or make alternative use of the product. The Department found that the respondents planned 80 percent of their
production around the U.S. market and sold excess production in markets in which they did not necessarily plan to sell.
These factors combined to create a ``chance element'' to third country sales which raised the concern that any observed
price differences would be unrelated to dumping. 
We note that there are substantial similarities between flowers and roses. First, roses, like flowers, are extremely
perishable. Second, rose growers have relatively greater, though still minor, control over short-term production
than flower growers because of their ability to pinch back buds. Third, as with flowers, roses cannot be stored and
we note that there are only very minor alternative uses (

e.g.,

 drying). While some respondents are able to sell a small percentage of their production to markets other than the United
States as a regular part of their business plan, which reduces to some extent the ``chance'' element to selling excess
production, we note that this was also true with some companies in 

Flowers.

 See 

Methodological Issues Concerning Colombian Cut Flowers,

 Sparks Commodities, Inc. 1989. 
In view of the questions raised above, we conclude that, for the purpose of the preliminary determination, the evidence
at this stage is not sufficient to justify departure from our normal practice of reliance on third country prices.
However, we intend to revisit this issue in our final determination in light of further information and analysis with
regard to the three factors set out in 

Flowers

 as well as any other facts that might be relevant on this issue. 


Third Country Sales 


For three of the 16 respondents, the home market was not viable; therefore, we based FMV on third country sales (

See

 the September 12, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). These three companies and their selected
third country markets were: Grupo Clavecol (Argentina and Canada); Grupo Sabana (Canada); and Grupo Tropicales
(Argentina and Germany). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49(c), we selected for two of these respondents more than one
third country because a single third country did not meet the Department's viability standards. 
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49, we selected the appropriate third country market(s) for each respondent based on
the following criteria: similarity of merchandise sold in the third country to the merchandise exported to the United
States, the volume of sales to the third country, and the similarity of market organization and development between
the third country and U.S. markets. For a complete discussion of the selection of third country market(s), see the
June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford.

<TEXT>
 

Based on petitioner's allegations that Grupo Tropicales was selling roses in Argentina at prices below its COP, and
information on the record, the Department had a reasonable basis to suspect or believe that sales were made below cost
and therefore initiated a COP investigation to determine whether Grupo Tropicales had Argentine sales that were
made at prices less than their COP. Although Grupo Tropicales also had third country sales to Germany, we did not initiate
a COP investigation on these sales because they were not included in petitioner's COP allegation (

See 

the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
For a discussion of our COP test methodology, see the ``Home Market Sales'' section above. We made no adjustments to
the COP and CV data submitted by Grupo Tropicales.
In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as described below:


1. Grupo Clavecol


For Grupo Clavecol, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Canada.
For third country to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, air freight, and
brokerage and handling, where applicable. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we
made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted third country packing
costs and added U.S. packing costs.
For third country to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, air freight
and brokerage and handling. We also deducted the weighted-average Argentine and Canadian indirect selling expenses,
including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions
or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We deducted third country
packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.


2. Grupo Sabana


For Grupo Sabana, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Canada.
For third country price to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for Canadian inland freight, air freight,
Canadian import duties, U.S. brokerage and Colombian inland freight. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act
and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted
third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.
For third country price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for Canadian inland freight,
air freight, Canadian import duties, Canadian brokerage and Colombian inland freight. In addition, we made deductions
for credit and direct selling expenses in Canada. We also deducted the weighted-average Canadian and Colombian indirect
selling expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related
party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We
deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.


3. Grupo Tropicales


For Grupo Tropicales, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Germany.
For third country price to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight. Pursuant to
section 773(a)(4)(B) and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for
credit expenses. We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs.
For third country price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. In
addition, we made deductions for credit. We also deducted the weighted-average Argentine and German indirect selling
expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the indirect selling expenses
incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We deducted third country packing costs and added
U.S. packing costs.


Constructed Value


For three of the 16 respondents, we calculated FMV based directly on CV, in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act,
because these respondents did not have adequate sales in either the home market nor in any third country markets during
the POI. These three companies were: Agrorosas S.A.; Flores Mocari S.A. and Rosex LTDA. We calculated CV based on the
sum of respondent's cost of cultivation, plus general expenses, profit and U.S. packing. For general expenses, we
used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation.
For profit, we used the greater of the weighted average third country profit during the POI or the statutory minimum
of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and total SG&A expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2).
For these respondents, we based the amortization expense upon amounts normally recorded by each company in their
usual record keeping. We rejected adjustments that companies made to the amortization expense solely for purposes
of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to respondents' CV data as described below:


1. Agrorosas S.A.


For Agrorosas S.A., we did not consider the minor pre-verification correction filed on September 9, 1994 for the preliminary
determination. This data will be fully analyzed for our final determination.


2. Flores Mocari S.A.


For Flores Mocari S.A., we revised the calculation of interest expense to express the expense as a per-unit amount.


3. Rosex LTDA

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For Rosex LTDA, we also revised the calculation of interest expense to express the expense as a per unit amount.
In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as described below:


1. Agrorosas S.A.


For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstances of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.
For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses and commissions. We also deducted
from CV the weighted-average U.S. indirect selling expenses up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred
on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).


2. Flores Mocari S.A.


For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.
For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the
weighted-average U.S. indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater
of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).


3. Rosex LTDA


For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses.
For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses and commissions. We also deducted
from CV the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of indirect selling expenses
incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).


Currency Conversion


Regarding transactions in third country currencies, we made currency conversions based on the official exchange
rates in effect during the month of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.
Because certified exchange rates for Colombia were unavailable from the Federal Reserve, we made currency conversions
for expenses denominated in Colombian pesos based on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates of
the U.S. sales as published by the International Monetary Fund.


Verification


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination.


Critical Circumstances


In the petition, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to importation of roses.
However, we did not initiate a critical circumstances investigation because, since roses are extremely perishable,
it is not possible to accumulate an inventory of roses in order to evade a potential antidumping duty order. Therefore,
we determined that an allegation that critical circumstances exist is without merit (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).

Suspension of Liquidation


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of fresh cut roses from Colombia, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that
are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the


Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:






ITC Notification


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination.


Public Comment


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than October 17, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than October
24, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested parties
an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on
October 25, 1994, at 9:30 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue,

Period of Investigation 


The Department initiated this investigation using our standard six-month POI from September 1, 1993, to February
28, 1994. On April 5, 1994, petitioner submitted comments on the POI. On April 11, 1994, respondents also submitted
comments on the POI. On April 14, 1994, the Department altered the POI to calendar year 1993 because of the seasonal
nature of sales and production in the rose industry (

See

 the April 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Richard W. Moreland).

In addition, for purposes of price-to-price comparisons, we are basing FMV on two six month periods: January 1, 1993,
through June 30, 1993, and July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. For further discussion of these periods, see the
September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum.



Best Information Available



We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA)
is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise by Florinsa.

In assigning BIA, the Department applies a two-tier methodology based on the degree of respondent's cooperation.
In the first tier, the Department normally assigns higher margins (

i.e., 

margins based on more adverse assumptions) for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation or which
otherwise impede the proceeding. If a respondent is deemed as non-cooperative, the Department bases the preliminary
margin for the relevant class or kind of merchandise on the higher of: (1) the highest margin in the petition or (2) the
highest calculated margin of any respondent within the country that supplied adequate responses for the relevant
class or kind of merchandise.

In the second tier, the Department assigns lower margins to those respondents who substantially cooperate in an investigation.
These margins are based on the higher of: (1) The highest calculated margin for any respondent within that country
that supplied adequate information for the relevant class or kind of merchandise or (2) the average margin of the margins
in the petition (

See, e.g., 

Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992 (May 3, 1989)).

The Department's two-tiered methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (

See Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States

, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 

See also Krupp Stahl AG 

v. 

United States

, 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)).

We have determined that Florinsa's original and deficiency questionnaire responses were unusable for the preliminary
determination because they contain significant deficiencies (

See

 the September 12, 1994, memorandum from David L. Binder to Barbara R. Stafford). However, because Florinsa responded
to our requests for information, we find that it has been substantially cooperative for purposes of this preliminary
determination. Accordingly, we used as second-tier BIA for this respondent the average of the margins contained
in the petition, which is 84.72 percent. This margin is higher than the highest margin calculated for any respondent
in this investigation.

Furthermore, we have issued a supplemental deficiency letter to Florinsa. If this respondent submits an adequate
and timely response to this letter, we will conduct verification for Florinsa and will consider its information for
purposes of the final determination.



Such or Similar Comparisons



We have determined that all roses covered by this investigation comprise two categories of ``such or similar'' merchandise:
culls and export-quality roses. None of the respondents reported sales of culls in the United States. Therefore,
no comparisons in this such or similar category were made. Regarding export quality roses, where possible, we made
comparisons of identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market or third
country market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of: (1) form (

e.g., 

as part of a bouquet, an individual stem, etc.), (2) type (

e.g., 

hybrid tea, sweetheart, etc.), (3) color, (4) stem length, and (5) variety. We did not make any adjustments for differences
in the physical characteristics of the merchandise because respondents reported no cost differences between the
varieties.



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether sales of roses from Ecuador to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the FMV for all non-BIA respondents, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and
``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.



United States Price



For sales by Arbusta and Guaisa, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, when the
subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and when exporter's
sales price (ESP) methodology was not otherwise indicated.

In addition, for Arbusta, Guaisa, and Floricola, where sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation
into the United States, we also based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act.

During the POI, each of the respondents paid commissions to related parties in the United States. We determined that
these commissions were directly related to the sales under consideration. We also tested these commissions for these
respondents to determine whether they were paid at arm's length using the criteria set forth in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium (56 FR 56359, November 4, 1991). Where we found
that they were paid at arm's length, we deducted them from USP. However, we found that respondents used these commissions
as a mechanism for reimbursing their related parties for their actual expenses. Accordingly, in order to avoid double-counting,
where the actual expenses of the related party were less than the commissions, we deducted only the commissions. Where
the commissions were less than the actual expenses, we also deducted the amount by which the actual expenses exceeded
the commissions (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).

In addition, each of the respondents classified credits related to quality problems with the merchandise as warranty
expenses. However, because these quality-related credits functioned as price reductions, we reclassified them
as such.

Finally, none of the respondents reported inventory carrying costs on their ESP sales. Accordingly, we calculated
these costs using an inventory carrying period of seven days, which, due to the perishable nature of the product, is
the maximum amount of time that can transpire between the time a rose is cut and when it must be sold to the ultimate customer,
according to a public report by Harry K. Tayama, Ph.D., submitted in the companion investigation on fresh cut roses
from Colombia and placed, as well, on the public record for this investigation.

For all U.S. prices, we used monthly USPs, because we determined that monthly prices are representative of the transactions
under investigation (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum).

We made company-specific adjustments, as follows:

1. Arbusta



For Arbusta, we calculated purchase price based on packed F.O.B. Quito prices to unrelated customers. In accordance
with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight. We also
made deductions for export taxes imposed by the government of Ecuador, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(B) of
the Act.

We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for quality-related credits, foreign inland freight, export taxes, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage
and handling expenses, U.S. inland freight, and credit expenses. Also, as described above, we deducted the greater
of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses.

Arbusta failed to report foreign inland freight expenses for a small number of transactions in its ESP sales listing.
As BIA for these expenses, we assigned the highest freight amount for any other of Arbusta's ESP transactions.

Regarding export taxes, Arbusta did not report these taxes in its sales listing. Because the taxes are included in
the USP, we, therefore, calculated them based on the formula given in Arbusta's response.

Arbusta calculated U.S. customs duties for its sales agents in Miami on the basis of sales volume. Because these duties
were incurred on the basis of sales value, we recalculated them accordingly.

Arbusta calculated credit expenses using an interest rate based, in part, on loans taken outside the POI. Therefore,
we revised the interest rate to reflect only POI-related borrowings and recalculated credit expenses using this
revised rate.

Regarding indirect selling expenses in Ecuador, we based these expenses on BIA because Arbusta did not report them
in its sales listing. As BIA, we included the per unit expense reported in Arbusta's calculation of CV. However, because
Arbusta did not include the indirect selling expenses of one of its four related farms, as an additional BIA amount,
we divided the expenses of the other three related farms by three and added this to the total expense amount.

Regarding indirect selling expenses incurred by Arbusta's related party in New York, we determined that Arbusta's
calculations contained a number of errors. Accordingly, we based these expenses on BIA. As BIA, we used the single
highest amount reported for any sales transaction by this related party.

Regarding indirect selling expenses incurred by Arbusta's other U.S. related parties, Arbusta reported monthly
indirect selling expenses instead of a yearly average. Accordingly, we recalculated the expenses reported for one
of these parties as a percentage of annual sales value. However, the expenses reported for the other related party
appeared to pertain to another expense, unrelated to indirect selling expenses. Therefore, we based the calculation
of this expense on BIA for sales through this company. As BIA, we applied the annual percentage noted above.



2. Floricola



For Floricola, we calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions,
where appropriate, for quality-related credits, including billing and other credits, foreign inland freight,
export taxes imposed by the government of Ecuador, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. Department of Agriculture
inspection fees, U.S. inland freight, and credit expenses. We also made deductions for U.S., Panamanian, and Ecuadorian
indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs and brokerage and handling expenses, because these
services were performed in-house.

Floricola did not report export taxes. Because it is clear from other questionnaire responses that all exporters
pay this tax and that the tax is included in the USP, as BIA, we calculated it using the formula provided in Arbusta's
response.



3. Guaisa



For Guaisa, we calculated purchase price based on packed F.O.B. Quito prices to unrelated customers. We made deductions,
where appropriate, for quality-related credits and foreign inland freight. We also made deductions for export taxes
imposed by the government of Ecuador. We corrected respondent's inaccurate foreign inland freight calculation
by reallocating truck maintenance expenses over the entire POI.

We calculated ESP based on packed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for quality-related credits, foreign inland freight, air freight, U.S. customs duties, U.S. brokerage and handling
expenses, and credit expenses. Also, as described above, we deducted the greater of related party commissions or
indirect selling expenses.

Guaisa reported that it earned a rebate, as well as six free round-trip tickets, from its air freight carrier based
on its volume of sales to the United States during the POI. We deducted the rebate from Guaisa's air freight calculations.
However, because it is not clear that the airline tickets affect air freight costs, we did not adjust air freight for
the value of these tickets.

Finally, Guaisa did not include the administrative expenses of its U.S. sales subsidiary in its calculation of U.S.
indirect selling expenses. Moreover, Guaisa included employee commissions in its indirect selling expenses. Because
the U.S. subsidiary is solely a sales organization, we reclassified its administrative expenses as indirect selling
expenses, and included these expenses in our calculations. In addition, we reclassified employee commissions as
commission expenses and made a separate adjustment for them.



Foreign Market Value



In calculating FMV, wherever there were no sales of comparable merchandise in the home market or third country markets,
we based FMV on CV. In addition, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, for price-to-price comparisons, we compared U.S.
sales to third country sales made at the same level of trade, where possible.

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of fresh cut roses in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of export quality roses to the volume of third country
sales of export quality roses in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined
that none of the three non-BIA respondents had a viable home market.

For sales made by Arbusta and Guaisa, we based FMV on third country sales or CV, when there were no third country sales
of comparable merchandise. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49(c), we selected for these respondents more than one third
country because a single third country did not meet the Department's viability standards.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49(b), we selected the appropriate third country markets for Arbusta and Guaisa based
on the following criteria: similarity of merchandise sold in the third country to the merchandise exported to the
United States, the volume of sales to the third country, and the similarity of market organization between the third
country and U.S. markets. For a complete discussion of the selection of third country markets, see the June 14, 1994,
memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford.

<TEXT>
 

For all transactions made by Floricola, we based FMV on CV in accordance with sections 773(a)(2) and (e) of the Act,
because it did not have sufficient sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market or in any third country markets
during the POI. Additionally, we based FMV on CV for a portion of Arbusta's and Guaisa's transactions, because these
sales had no matches of such or similar merchandise in the third country markets in the same period as the sales made
in the United States. For a further discussion, see the ``Third Country Sales Versus Constructed Value'' section
of this notice.

For all CV transactions, for general expenses, which includes selling and financial expenses (SG&A), we used
the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For
Arbusta's and Guaisa's profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average third country profit during the POI or
the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with section
773(e)(B) of the Act. For Floricola, we based profit on the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation
and total general expenses, in accordance with section 773(e)(B) of the Act. We based the amortization expense upon
amounts normally recorded by each company in their usual recordkeeping. We rejected adjustments that respondents
made to the amortization expense solely for purposes of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to
respondents' CV data as described below:



1. Guaisa



For Guaisa, we 1) reallocated general and administrative expenses among products based upon the area under cultivation;
2) removed the effect of a special adjustment made to eliminate the costs associated with a severe windstorm; and 3)
reallocated financial expenses among products based upon the area under cultivation.



2. Floricola



For Floricola, we removed the reported net interest income credit from the CV calculation because we only allow interest
income to offset the interest expense.

In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as follows:



1. Arbusta



For Arbusta, we based FMV on packed prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Germany.

For third country price-to-purchase price comparisons, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from
FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight.
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences
in credit expenses.

For third country price-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight and credit expenses.
We also made a deduction for inventory carrying costs based on an inventory carrying period of seven days, as was done
for the calculation of USP. We disallowed Arbusta's claimed indirect selling expense adjustment because Arbusta
failed to provide an adequate narrative description or a worksheet showing its calculations.

We recalculated credit expenses using Arbusta's POI short-term interest rate as discussed in the ``United States
Price'' section of this notice.

For all price-to-price comparisons, we deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. We recalculated packing expenses in both markets to exclude depreciation on one
of Arbusta's packing facilities. In addition, we recalculated these expenses on an annual basis because Arbusta's
monthly calculations contained adjusting entries which were not properly matched with the month in which the expense
was incurred.

For CV-to-purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit
expenses.

For CV-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV
the weighted-average third country market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to
the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). We added U.S. packing expenses, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.

2. Guaisa 



For Guaisa, we based FMV on packed prices to unrelated customers in Germany and Sweden. 

For third country price-to-purchase price comparisons, we deducted quality-related credits. We also deducted
post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56. This
adjustment included foreign inland freight. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments,
where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and commissions paid to an unrelated party. We deducted third
country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 

For third country price-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, credit expenses and
commissions paid to an unrelated party. We also deducted the weighted-average third country indirect selling expenses,
up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses, including invoice carrying
costs, incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). Inventory carrying costs were based on an inventory carrying period
of seven days, as was done for the calculation of USP. 

Regarding credit expenses, Guaisa incorrectly calculated the credit period for certain third country transactions.
In addition, Guaisa calculated its short-term interest rate based on borrowings from related parties. 
Accordingly, as BIA, we used the shortest credit period reported for any third country sale. We then recalculated
Guaisa's third country and U.S. purchase price credit expenses using its interest rate paid to unrelated parties.


For CV-to-purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit
expenses. 

For CV-to-ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We also deducted from CV
the weighted-average third country market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, up to
the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses, including indirect carrying
costs, incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). We added U.S. packing costs, in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 



3. Floricola 



For Floricola, we based FMV on CV. The CV includes the cost of materials and cultivation of the merchandise exported
to the United States, plus SG&A expenses, profit, and packing. We used U.S. selling expenses in our CV calculation
instead of using Floricola's home market selling expenses. For the final determination, however, we will revisit
the issue of the appropriate selling expenses for use in Floricola's CV calculation. 

We deducted credit expenses. We also deducted U.S. indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) (

See

 the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). 

We also added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 



Third Country Versus Constructed Value 



On March 30, 1994, counsel for 14 of the 16 Colombian respondents in the companion investigation on fresh cut roses
from Colombia requested that the Department reject third-country sales and rely instead on constructed value as

The basis for FMV. We considered this issue for this case as well. 

The Department's normal preference, based on its regulations, is to utilize third-country sales rather than constructed
value when there is a viable third country market. See 19 CFR 353.48(b). Respondents have urged departure from this
practice, citing Certain Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review
55 FR 20491 (May 17, 1990) (

Flowers

). The Department determined in 

Flowers

 that departure from our normal practice was warranted after an analysis of three unusual factors present in that case.
Respondents argue that the facts in this investigation present even more compelling reasons to reject third-country
sales than were present in 

Flowers

. In determining whether the circumstances in this case are such that it should fall under the exception established
in 

Flowers

, we have analyzed the information presented in light of the three factors set forth in 

Flowers

: 1) negative correlation of price and volume movements between markets; 2) peak to non-peak comparisons; and 3) the
perishability of the subject merchandise.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As a threshold matter, we note that the record in this case is different from 

Flowers

 in that European markets play a relatively less important role in our analysis. In 

Flowers,

 the Department's analysis focused solely on a comparison of the U.S. market with European markets as the vast majority
of third country markets under consideration were in Europe. The Department did not evaluate conditions in other
markets. In this case, and the companion investigation in Colombia, respondents reported significant sales to Argentina
and Canada, as well as Europe. Respondents in this case have submitted additional information for all the relevant
markets_Europe, Canada, and Argentina. However, it is not clear that the information submitted up to this point supports
respondents' assertion that sales in the third country markets should not be compared to U.S. sales in this case. 



Negative Correlation Factor 



In 

Flowers,

 the Department found a negative correlation between price and volume movements in the United States and European
markets. This negative correlation indicated that price differences between markets could either mask or exaggerate
dumping. The Department determined that the negative correlation was caused by a number of elements, including:
1) the greater price and volume volatility of the U.S. market; 2) the sporadic, gift-giving nature of U.S. demand;
3) respondents' lack of access to the European auctions (the main distribution point for flowers in Europe); and 4)
differing peak price periods. 

Respondents argue that, in this case, there is similar evidence of a negative correlation of price and volume movements
between the U.S. and third country markets. In support of their position, respondents have submitted several reports.
A 1994 report by Professor Tayama analyzes, among other things, the consumption patterns for roses in the United States,
Europe, Canada and Argentina, and compares seasonal and holiday purchasing patterns in the markets. Tayama asserts
that both Europe and Canada have mature and relatively stable markets because both markets are supply driven (

i.e.,

 in times of peak production as supply increases, prices go down). In contrast, Tayama claims that the U.S. market is
demand driven_the majority of sales are made for Valentine's Day when demand increases and prices rise. With regard
to Argentina, Tayama states that roses are grown for home consumption and imports occur mainly during the winter months,
as in Europe. Moreover, Tayama asserts, Argentina has a different seasonal and holiday pattern from the United States.
No market, he states, has the extraordinary demand for roses that exists in the U.S. market on Valentine's Day. 

Petitioners have countered Tayama's assertions with an August 10, 1994, submission which contains, among other
things, a report by 

Roses Inc.,

 an association of U.S. rose producers. The 

Roses Inc.

 report raises questions about the conclusions in the Tayama report, asserting that: 1) there is a global market for
roses which is driven by demand everywhere; and 2) key holiday periods are actually very similar between the United
States and Europe_specifically that the highest prices in both the United States and Europe occur in February. Thus,
we are not in a position to conclude that the Tayama report provides a sufficient basis to determine that comparison
of U.S. sales to third country sales is inappropriate. 

In support of the conclusions drawn in the Tayama report, respondents submitted the 1994 

Fresh Cut Roses: Issues in the Estimation of Dumping in the U.S. Market

 (Botero Report) which contains a statistical analysis of the United States, European, and Canadian markets and seeks
to demonstrate the lack of correlation between price movements in the third country and U.S. markets. The Botero Report
provides three types of statistical analyses which, according to respondents, support their contention that third
country prices should not be used due to the ``different equilibrium conditions'' of these markets as compared to
the U.S. market for roses. First, Botero analyzes price movements within the United States, Europe and Canada, from
which he concludes that different market forces are at work (

i.e.,

 price and quantity movements within Europe and Canada are negatively correlated and price and quantity movements
within the United States are positively correlated). Second, Botero analyzes price and quantity movements across
markets and concludes that there is no correlation between the U.S. market and either the European or Canadian markets.
Third, he estimates the price cycles for roses in the U.S., European and Canadian markets and concludes that ``the
seasonal patterns of the two markets [U.S. and European, U.S. and Canadian] are different and therefore monthly price
comparisons do not reflect price discrimination.'' Botero asserts that these test results demonstrate that prices
in these third country markets should not be compared to prices in the U.S. market to determine price discrimination.


We have reviewed the Botero Report and have concerns regarding the data and the statistical parameters used to perform
the statistical analysis on European, Canadian and U.S. rose prices. For example, Dr. Botero relied on prices that
may not be comparable. U.S. prices for a single hybrid tea variety rose were compared to European prices for all hybrid
tea variety roses; and U.S. import prices, rather than U.S. domestic prices, were compared to European domestic prices.
These comparisons may be inappropriate_we have no basis to conclude that a single hybrid tea rose is representative
of all hybrid tea roses, or that U.S. import prices are representative of U.S. domestic prices. Moreover, Dr. Botero's
F-test results appear to be invalid. Dr. Botero apparently used the incorrect degrees of freedom_(k,n-2) instead
of (k-1,n-2). More importantly, Dr. Botero appears to have misread the ``F Table'': he reported the value of F

n-2,k

 at the 99 percent confidence level, rather than F

k-1,n-2

 at the 99 percent confidence level. Finally, Dr. Botero provided no explanation of his use of a 99 percent confidence
level.

In light of these questions, the Department, at this stage, finds the information on the record inconclusive as to
whether the third country and U.S. markets are negatively correlated. We intend to further evaluate the Botero Report
for purposes of making our final determination. Further details relating to this issue are set forth in the September
12, 1994, memorandum to Barbara Stafford. 



Peak to Non-Peak Factor 



Third country sales in 

Flowers

 were not made over the entire year. They were made only in peak months. The record established that Colombian growers
had little access to the European auction system and were only able to export flowers to Europe during those months
when domestic supply was low. On the other hand, the Colombian growers targeted 80 percent of their production to the
U.S. market and made sales to the United States in every month. As a result, the Department determined that it was unable
to make contemporaneous sales comparisons in all months and would be required to compare low-value U.S. sales in off-peak
months with high-value third country sales in peak months. 

The circumstances on the record in this case are somewhat different. One of the three companies reporting third country
sales has year-round sales to a single third country market, while the other two companies have third country sales
in every month in the markets selected by the Department pursuant to  353.49(c). Therefore, it appears that
the Department may have sufficient contemporaneous sales in the aggregate for all twelve months of the POI. Further,
the Department has based FMV on two six-month averages; the use of such averages also should reduce any potential for
distortion. 



Perishability Factor 



The third factor considered in 

Flowers

 was related to the role of perishability on production and sale. This factor included: 1) the extreme perishability
of the subject merchandise; 2) the inability of producers to control short-term production; and 3) the inability
to store or make alternative use of the product. The Department found that the respondents planned 80 percent of their
production around the U.S. market and sold excess production in markets in which they did not necessarily plan to sell.
These factors combined to create a ``chance element'' to third country sales which raised the concern that any observed
price differences would be unrelated to dumping. 

We note that there are substantial similarities between flowers and roses. First, roses, like flowers, are extremely
perishable. Second, rose growers have relatively greater, though still minor, control over short-term production
than flower growers because of their ability to pinch back buds. Third, as with flowers, roses cannot be stored and
we note that there are only very minor alternative uses (

e.g.

, drying). While some respondents are able to sell a small percentage of their production to markets other than the
United States as a regular part of their business plan, which reduces to some extent the ``chance'' element to selling
excess production, we note that this was also true with some companies in 

Flowers

. See Methodological Issues Concerning Colombian Cut Flowers, Sparks Commodities, Inc. 1989. 

In view of the questions raised above, we conclude that, for the purpose of the preliminary determination, the evidence
at this stage is not sufficient to justify departure from our normal practice of reliance on third country prices.
However, we intend to revisit this issue in our final determination in light of further information and analysis with
regard to the three factors set out in 

Flowers

 as well as any other facts that might be relevant on this issue. 



Currency Conversion 



Because certified exchange rates for Ecuador were unavailable from the Federal Reserve, we made currency conversions
for expenses denominated in Ecuadorian sucres based on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates
of the U.S. sales as published by the International Monetary Fund. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 



Critical Circumstances 



In the petition, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to importation of roses.
However, we did not initiate a critical circumstances investigation because, since roses are extremely perishable,
it is not possible to accumulate an inventory of roses in order to evade a potential antidumping duty order. Therefore,
we determined that an allegation that critical circumstances exist is without merit (

See 

the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum). 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of fresh cut roses from Ecuador, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that
are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the


Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:

ITC Notification


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than October 17, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than October
24, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested parties
an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on
October 25, 1994, at 9:30 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The consolidated claims in question arose from two organization-wide audits of the Maine Department of Education,
conducted by the Maine Department of Audit for the periods between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988 (ACN: 01-93245)
and July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989 (ACN: 01-13035-G). The audits were conducted pursuant to the Single Audit
Act of 1984 and Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-128. 


In reviewing the State's administration of programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Part
B) (formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act) for the period between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1988, the auditors
found that the State's administrative costs under the Part B program exceeded the allowable maximum by $354,211.63.
The auditors determined that, due to the differences between State and Federal fiscal years, $65,325 of this amount
had previously been questioned in the June 30, 1987 audit report. Consequently, for the period between July 1, 1987
and June 30, 1988, the auditors questioned administrative costs in the amount of $288,886 (the difference between
$354,211 and $65,325). Additionally, during this same State fiscal year, the auditors found that the State had charged
personnel costs to various Federal programs for employees who had not worked exclusively on those programs, questioning
$77,700 in Part B personnel costs. 
On October 14, 1991, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS),
issued a program determination letter (PDL) stating that the administrative cost finding had been addressed in a
previous PDL (dated March 27, 1991) and that the personnel finding was not being sustained due to insufficient information
in the audit report. However, upon further review and follow-up by the Department's Regional Inspector General for
Audit with staff of the State Auditor's office and upon review of their workpapers, it was determined that there was
no support for the charging of 100 percent of two employees' time to several different Part B programs. On June 29, 1992,
the Assistant Secretary for OSERS issued a Program Redetermination Letter (PRDL) seeking recovery of $311,840 in
fiscal year (FY) 1987 funds. 
In reviewing the State's administration of programs under Part B and under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act (the Perkins Act), for the period between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989, the auditors found
that under the Part B program the State incurred $50,580 in administrative costs in excess of the allowable maximum.
Additionally, the auditors determined that personnel costs for a number of employees who did not work exclusively
for the Handicapped-State Grant Program funded under Part B, and the Vocational Education Basic Grants Program funded
under the Perkins Act, were charged entirely to those Federal programs. In total, the auditors questioned $133,140
in personnel costs incurred in the period between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989. 
On August 25, 1992 the Assistant Secretary for OSERS and the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Vocational and Adult
Education (OVAE) issued a joint PDL seeking recovery of $140,852 in FY 1989 funds. Of that total, $90,272 was disallowed
in a joint finding between the Assistant Secretaries for OSERS and OVAE, related to salary charges under Part B and
the Perkins Act. Specifically, the Assistant Secretaries determined that in FY 1989, $44,832 awarded under Part
B and $45,440 awarded under the Perkins Act had been used by the State to pay administrative salaries without the required
supporting documentation. 
On July 29, 1992, the State filed a timely request for review of the Assistant Secretary for OSERS' determination in
the PDL for ACN: 01-93245, with the Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ). Upon joint motion by the parties,
on March 16, 1992, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) assigned to this matter stayed the proceeding for purposes of
mediation. On September 25, 1992, the State filed a timely request for review of the Assistant Secretaries for OSERS'
and OVAE's determinations in the PDL for ACN: 01-13035-G. Upon joint motion by the parties, on October
22, 1992, the ALJ stayed the proceeding for purposes of mediation, and consolidated the two cases. On March 12, 1993,
the ALJ granted a Joint Motion to Stay the Proceedings for Settlement Discussions, filed by the parties. 
In the course of ensuing settlement discussions, the State submitted documentary evidence not previously seen by
the auditors relevant to both the Part B excess administrative cost and the personnel salaries issues raised under
the Part B and Perkins Act programs. As a result of settlement discussions, the parties tentatively agreed to a settlement
under which the State would repay a total of $125,635 to the Department in full resolution of all issues. 
With regard to the Part B excess administrative costs determinations contained in both PDLs, during mediation and
settlement discussions the State was able to demonstrate that it had expended $12,863.27 of excess administrative
costs in FY 1987, and $55,817.84 of excess administrative costs in FY 1988, for a total of $68,681.11 in excess administrative
costs. Under the tentative Settlement Agreement, the State will submit revised SF-269s to the Department reflecting
its reconciliation of certain administrative costs expenditures for FYs 1987 and 1988.
With regard to both Assistant Secretaries' determinations of unsupported charging of personnel salaries, in the
course of mediation and settlement discussions the State submitted documentation not seen by the auditors demonstrating
to the Assistant Secretary for OSERS that the majority of two salaries questioned in the PDL for ACN: 01-93245
were properly expended under Part B. Additionally, the State agreed that its charging of a $44,832 salary to the FY
1989 Part B grant was erroneous. The State proposed to offset the improper salary charges with what it believed to be
allowable administrative expenditures that had not previously been charged to the Part B grant but that had been incurred
during the fiscal years at issue in these audits. 
On June 14, 1994, the Assistant Secretary for OSERS filed a Notice of Withdrawal of Claims and Reduction of Amount in
Dispute covering disallowances in the June 29, 1992 PRDL for ACN: 01-93245 and in the August 25, 1992 PDL in ACN:
01-13015-G, in which the Assistant Secretary reduced the Part B claims in this consolidated appeal to
$45,272 for the June 29, 1992 PRDL and to $115,046 for the August 25, 1992 PDL. The latter total included disallowances
under the Perkins Act for which no reduction of claim was included in the June 14, 1994 Notice. As a result of the June
14, 1994 withdrawal notice, the disallowances for both cases totalled $160,318. 
Under the tentative Settlement Agreement negotiated between the parties, the State has agreed to repay $125,635
to the Department in full resolution of the issues raised in both the PRDL and the PDL. Of this amount, $45,272 would
be in full settlement of the claims under Part B contained in the June 29, 1992 PRDL. And, $80,363 would be in full settlement
of the claims under Part B and under the Perkins Act contained in the August 25, 1992 PDL. Of this amount, $63,664 settles
the Part B disallowance and $16,699 settles the Perkins Act disallowance.
In addition to the repayment of funds, the State has agreed to submit to the Department revised Financial Status Reports
for fiscal years 1987 through 1993 reflecting proper coding of excess administrative costs to the grants during each
of the years within that period. The State has also provided an assurance in the tentative Settlement Agreement that
it will not shift excess administrative expenditures forward, to fiscal years after FY 1992, that are related to disallowances
either in the June 29, 1992 PRDL or in the August 25, 1992 PDL. Finally, the State has certified in the tentative Settlement
Agreement that it is currently in compliance with all requirements of the statutes and regulations pertaining to
the practices and procedures that gave rise to the disallowances in question in this consolidated appeal. 
In accordance with the authority provided in 20 U.S.C. 1234a(j)(1), given the documentation submitted by the State,
the certification and assurances provided by the State, and the estimated litigation risks and costs of proceeding
through the appeal process, the Department has determined that it would not be practical or in the public interest
to continue litigation of this case. Rather, under the authority provided in 20 U.S.C. 1234a(j)(1), the Department
has determined that a compromise of this claim for $125,635 would be appropriate. The public is invited to comment
on the Department's intent to compromise this claim. Additional information may be obtained by writing to Adina Kole,
Esq. or Daphna Crotty, Esq., at the address given at the beginning of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award; Intent to Award Renewal Grant to Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering
(SECME)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
renewal award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (B) and (D) to SECME, Atlanta, GA., under Amendment
A001 to Grant Number DE-FG01-93MI10270. The purpose of the award is to continue to develop an educational
and training program for middle and high school students, teachers and school administrators in the District of Columbia
public schools. The projects goal is to increase the number of minority students who are academically prepared to
enter college and complete studies in engineering, mathematics and science. The period of performance will be extended
two (2) years October 1, 1994-September 30, 1996. The total estimated cost of this budget period (10/1/94-9/30/95)
is $150,000 which will be provided by DOE_there is no cost sharing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed renewal grant will provide funding to SECME, which is a pre-college program designed to increase the
number of minority students who are academically prepared to enter and complete studies in engineering, mathematics,
and science. SECME is a nonprofit organization organized in 1975 by the engineering deans of six Southeastern universities.
SECME is proposing to expand its consortium network by establishing the SECME school systems model in the District
of Columbia, with the development of 16 school programs in four schools systems in DC covering the northwest, northeast,
southwest and southeast areas. The University of the District of Columbia's College of Engineering will serve as
SECME's 33rd member university and work with SECME school programs throughout the targeted region. The University's
role is vital to the success of the program. The University's support to the schools will be through Saturday School
Engineering Workshops and school visits from engineering faculty consultants who provide information on additions
to school curricula, on-going curriculum enrichment, and university-level preparatory courses.



The program is meritorious because by increasing the pool of minority students who are prepared to enter and complete
studies in the scientific technical fields, the competitiveness and prosperity of the American workforce will be
significantly enhanced in the years ahead. The project will assist teachers in formulating ways to enrich their instructional
programs through the use of curriculum materials and computer applications and help them develop motivational guidance
for their students. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.

Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the application
represents a beneficial method to ensure precollege students' success in courses which are prerequisite to technical
education and careers. Through this project, students will be better prepared to enroll in and succeed in university-level
engineering, mathematics, and science programs.

[Docket No. ER94-1628-000]



Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Delmarva Power & Light Company (Delmarva) of Wilmington, Delaware, filed
under the provisions of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act a twenty-year power supply contract (the Service Agreement)
under which Delmarva will provide all requirements service to the Town of Clayton, Delaware (Clayton). Delmarva
states that the Service Agreement supersedes Delmarva's Rate Schedule No. 64 under which Clayton currently receives
service. 

Delmarva, with Clayton's concurrence, requests a waiver of the 60-day notice requirement and an effective date as
allowed for by the terms of the Service Agreement that commences with the date prior to November 6, 1994, that Clayton
actually begins taking all requirements service from the Company. Alternatively, Delmarva asks for an effective
date of November 6, 1994, which is sixty days after the filing date. 

The Service Agreement provides for the continuation of the requirements service previously furnished Clayton under
Rate Schedule No. 64, but changes certain terms and conditions. The chief differences between the Service Agreement
and Rate Schedule No. 64 are that the Service Agreement provides for all requirements service as a change from the partial
requirements service Clayton was receiving, establishes a new rate for Clayton which is below the level of the rate
currently charged Clayton and below the settlement rate previously established for Clayton in Docket No. ER92-236-000,
and provides for future adjustments to the Clayton rate based on changes in the level of Delmarva's retail rates. The
Service Agreement has a twenty year term. 


Delmarva states that the filing has been posted and has been served upon the affected customer and the Delaware Public
Service Commission.

<DOCTITLE>South Carolina Electric & Gas Company; Intent To Conduct Public Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>



September 14, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of the Stevens Creek Hydroelectric
Project, FERC No. 2535. The project is located in Edgefield and McCormick Counties, South Carolina and Columbia County,
Georgia, within the Savannah River Basin.

The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.



Scoping Meetings



The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while a
morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies
are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed
in the EA. Staff will visit the project site prior to the meetings to become more familiar with the project and its operation.

Both scoping meetings will be held on Wednesday, October 12, 1994, in the Savannah Rapids Pavilion, 3300 Evans to Lock
Road, Martinez, Ga. The first meeting will be held from 9:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. and will focus primarily on issues
of concern to resource agencies. The second meeting will be held from 7:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m. and will focus primarily
on issues of concern to the general public.

Prior to the meetings, a scoping document will be mailed to the list of interested parties. The scoping document identifies
resource issues to be addressed in the EA. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings
or can be obtained by writing: FERC_Stevens Creek Project, c/o Tom Dupuis, CH2M HILL, P.O. Box 2090, Milwaukee, Wisconsin
53201-2090.



Objectives



At the scoping meetings the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the EA; (2) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EA; (3) identify resource issues
that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views.



Procedures



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal
record of the Commission proceedings. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly
identify themselves for the record.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.

Participants at the public meetings are asked to keep oral comments brief and concise.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed
with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426,
until November 12, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Stevens Creek EA, Project
No. 2535.

All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the licensing proceeding are asked to refrain
from engaging staff or its contractor in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings.

Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents
with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list.

For further information, please contact John Blair (202) 219-2845.

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>



September 14, 1994.



Take notice that on September 12, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing and acceptance pursuant
to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act a Statement
of Rates tariff sheet to its Third Revised Volume No. 2 Tariff. 

El Paso states that the tendered tariff sheet was inadvertently omitted from its July 29, 1994, filing at Docket No.
RP94-338-000, which the Commission approved by letter order dated August 25, 1994.

El Paso states that the tendered tariff sheet, proposed to become effective August 1, 1994, provides for a decrease
of $.0013 per dth in El Paso's currently effective take-or-pay Throughput Surcharge due to the removal of the unamortized
portion of certain ineligible costs resulting from the Commission's Order Affirming Initial Decision and Order
on Rehearing issued concurrently on June 16, 1994, at Docket No. RP90-81-000, et al., and Docket No. RP91-26-000,
et al., (June 16th Orders) respectively.

El Paso states that it is requesting waiver of the notice requirement of Section 154.22 of the Commission Regulations
pursuant to Section 154.51 to permit the tendered tariff sheet to become effective on August 1, 1994, in order to be
consistent with the date the Commission accepted the other affected tariff sheets containing the decrease in the
Throughput Surcharge. Furthermore, no party will be harmed by the waiver of the notice requirement, since the result
will be a decrease in rates. 

El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all its Volume No. 2 tariff customers and interested state
regulatory commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules
and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before September 21, 1994. Protests will be considered by
the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to
the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the
Public Reference Room

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Program Announcement and Solicitation for Minority Academic Institution (MAI) Participation in Hazardous Substance
Research Centers (HSRC) Program; Pre-proposal for MAI Participation in the HSRC Program 



The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is concerned that minority academic institutions (MAIs) are underrepresented
in research and other activities relating to hazardous substance management. To improve this situation, EPA announces
the availability of funds to enhance the ability of MAIs to participate in research, technology transfer, training,
and academic development activities in collaboration with EPA's five University Hazardous Substance Research
Centers (HSRCs). The program rationale and design, areas of interest, eligibility requirements, and other important
information are described below. 

The process begins with submission of an original and eight copies of pre-proposals from MAIs to one of the five EPA
HSRCs. An administrative review will be made by the Center Director, in consultation with the EPA National HSRC Program
Director. Eligible applications will then be reviewed for relevance and quality by each Center's Director, Science
Advisory Committee, and Technology Transfer and Training Advisory Committees. Successful applicants will be invited
to submit full proposals. 



Hazardous Substance Problems 



One of the important environmental issues facing our civilization is the management of hazardous substances from
manufacture to treatment and disposal. Since 1980, over 40,000 hazardous waste sites have been discovered, more
than 1,000,000 underground storage tanks are estimated to be leaking, and more than 250,000 industrial and waste
storage or treatment facilities are subject to permit requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
A National Priorities List for cleanup of the worst of these sites has been established by EPA. This list, plus similar
state lists, total more than 5,000 sites. Such sites are causing contamination of air, soil, and ground and surface
water. There is a growing recognition of the risks such contamination inflicts upon ecological communities. Conventional
methods of determining, cleaning up, and managing these problems are proving inadequate to achieve desired levels
of clean-up. The HSRC Program is fueled by a strong desire to develop better, cheaper, faster, and safer methods to
assess and clean up these sites. EPA priorities for addressing these problems include development of new methods
to assess and remediate sites, decrease the production and use of hazardous substances, and train a new generation
of hazardous substance managers. 



General Description 



Under Section 311(d) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA),
as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9660(d), EPA has established five Hazardous Substance Research Centers. In 1994, Congress
provided EPA with funds to encourage MAIs to participate in the HSRCs' research and training and technology transfer
activities. These funds will be provided through a Federal Assistance Agreement with each HSRC, which in turn will
establish sub-contracts with MAIs. If additional funds become available, additional qualified applicants may
be funded. The MAI is expected to contribute a 20% match of non-federal resources. These resources may come from State,
local, foundation, individual, or private sector contributions and may include in-kind contributions. No Federal
funds provided for this program may be used to purchase, build, or renovate any buildings or to purchase land. Up to
15% of the funds will be available to encourage HSRC researchers to collaborate in joint projects with MAI researchers.




Hazardous Substance Research Center Program 



EPA has competitively established five Hazardous Substance Research Centers to provide: 

 Short- and long-term research on the manufacture, disposal, clean-up, and management of hazardous substances;


 Dissemination of research information and findings; and 

 Training, technology transfer, and technical outreach and support to benefit organizations, communities,
and individuals involved with hazardous substances. 




Research supported by the HSRCs covers all relevant scientific and technological subjects except human health effects
research (toxicology, dose-response epidemiology, etc.). Each HSRC is headed by a Center Director who is responsible
for managing each Center. The Director is the intellectual leader and guide for the Center. A Technology Transfer
and Training Director oversees training and commercial application of Center projects. Each of the five HSRCs serves
the States within two adjoining pairs of Federal Regions. All five collaborate to form a National Hazardous Substance
Research Centers Program. Each center has its own Science Advisory Committee and Technology Transfer and Training
Advisory Committee which regularly review the progress of ongoing work and recommend funding of new proposals.

Availability of Funds 



$3.5 million will be available for award under the terms described below. 



Submission and Eligibility Requirements 



U.S. MAIs in good standing with the Federal government may submit pre-proposals. Applications must include a written
certification that the applicant is a minority academic institution. The applicant's eligibility as an MAI will
be confirmed on the basis of enrollment data in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Fall Enrollment
Survey, provided by postsecondary institutions, through the National Center for Education Statistics, to the Office
for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education. The terms ``accredited,'' ``minority,'' and ``minority institution''
are set forth in 34 CFR 637.4(b). 

To be considered for an award, an original pre-proposal and eight copies must be submitted to the most appropriate
HSRC, as provided in the table. The pre-proposals are due at these contact points no later than 4:00 p.m. local time
on Friday, October 21, 1994. Applicants are encouraged to submit their pre-proposal as soon as possible to provide
for maximum opportunities to coordinate with appropriate HSRC staff and researchers. Receipt of pre-proposals
will be acknowledged for those applicants providing a mailing address label. Each pre-proposal must include the
information requested in the sample format at the end of this announcement. The proposed activity shall be described
in up to two pages addressing the evaluation criteria. A summary budget for up to an 18 month period shall be included.
HSRC research projects range from approximately $25,000-$75,000 per year. Each Center, upon reviewing the
pre-proposals, shall invite submission of full proposals. All applicants will be notified of the review results.







Program Orientation and Training 



All MAI program participants and administrative officials will meet initially with the EPA National Program Director,
Center Directors, and other Center and EPA personnel to initiate the program. Requirements for record keeping, laboratory
and site safety, quality assurance, etc., will be presented to program participants. All MAI research and faculty
participants will meet with Center Directors and other appropriate personnel in the latter part of their first year
to review the progress of the program. Requests for funds to support participation in these meetings shall be included
in each minority participation project.

Pre-Proposal Evaluation 



The first step in the review and selection process is an administrative review to determine eligibility and appropriateness.
For each Center, the following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate pre-proposals: 

 Short- and long-term benefits to the Minority Academic Institution; 

 Benefits to principal investigator professional development; 

 Benefits to student academic development; 

 Level of participation by minority individuals; 

 Compatibility with HSRC interests; 

 Leverage of resources; 

 Quality of work proposed; and 

 Potential impact of proposed activity. 



Areas of Interest 



Pre-proposals are encouraged in one or more of the following areas but will be considered in other areas as well. It
is recognized that some pre-proposals will incorporate elements from several areas of interest, such as a cooperative
research program that includes faculty and/or student enhancement. These pre-proposals are also encouraged and
will be evaluated on the strength of the consolidated pre-proposal. 




Cooperative Research Programs 




It is expected that most of the funds distributed under this solicitation will support cooperative research projects
which pair MAI investigators with HSRC investigators. The goals of a cooperative research project are to enhance
the research capabilities of the minority institution, promote significant interaction among the Center and MAIs,
and lead to a continuing collaboration among the investigators. Given the time constraints of the program, preference
will be given to projects that build on existing Center projects. New projects developed in collaboration with Center
investigators, however, can be proposed. A potential investigator is strongly encouraged to review the current
projects and activities of the Centers and contact Center personnel prior to submission of a pre-proposal. Examples
of project collaboration include periodic exchanges of researcher-in-residence at an MAI or HSRC facility, co-investigation
of a research topic, and joint supervision of research students. The specific nature of the collaboration will be
defined by the investigators. Necessary travel funds to provide for this collaboration shall be built into the project
pre-proposal. Pre-proposals are encouraged in the following broad HSRC research themes: 

 Thermal treatment/incineration; 

 Bioremediation; 

 Contaminated sediment and dredge material; 

 Mine wastes and contaminated soils; and 

 Remediation of contaminated groundwater. 




It is suggested that interested proponents review the Abstracts of HSRC Research Activities (following) and contact
the most appropriate HSRC from Table 1 for further information about specific personnel and research opportunities.




Faculty Enhancement 



The goal of the faculty enhancement component is to provide hazardous substance research opportunities to promote
professional growth of MAI faculty. A companion goal is to strengthen the hazardous substance research programs
at their home institutions. Specifically, the program is intended to: 

 Enhance research expertise and abilities; 

 Expand the knowledge-base in hazardous substance management research; 

 Provide hands-on experience with modern equipment and instrumentation; and 

 Help faculty develop linkages for future collaborative research. 

Activities to be supported include: 

 Academic-year sabbaticals (1-2 semesters); 

 Summer research visits (minimum of 10 weeks); and 

 Short-term faculty interactions (1-2 weeks). 

Faculty must be tenured or in a tenure-track position at an MAI to maximize potential benefits to the home institution.
For institutions without formal tenure systems, faculty holding a long-term or permanent position shall be eligible.




Student Enhancement 



MAIs are encouraged to develop pre-proposals which will provide internship programs for undergraduate and graduate
students. The goal of the student enhancement component is to motivate students toward advanced study and careers
in hazardous substance management by providing research and training opportunities at HSRC universities. Proposed
projects should provide undergraduates with an experience that fosters interest in pursuing graduate education
and research. Projects for graduate students should promote a greater understanding of the role of science and engineering
in providing solutions to hazardous substance related problems. The following selection criteria apply: 

 Undergraduate students should have completed one or more years of an academic program in a discipline with
an environmental focus. Graduate students should be pursuing a Masters or Ph.D. in an environmental discipline.


 Pre-proposals should demonstrate a plan for guiding students to the timely completion of research projects.


 MAIs should describe a student selection process that examines student academic records and recommendations
and also includes the potential student impact of selection into the program (e.g., high potential ``underachievers'',
etc.). 




The Center Director will assist in placing students into appropriate projects. Selections will be based on the strengths
of the proposed program and its ability to impact participants rather than the merits of individual students. 



Technology Transfer and Training 



There are a number of opportunities for MAIs to participate in the technology transfer and training activities of
the HSRCs. These opportunities may take a variety of forms, for example: cooperative ventures with existing HSRC
programs; development of new programs to assist in the development and commercialization of research technologies
to better manage hazardous substances; and training or education to communities, governmental decision makers,
industry, faculty, and students. 

Pre-proposals are solicited in the following areas: 

 Training to provide working knowledge of new technologies;

 Train-the-trainer courses for managing hazardous substance problems in minority and other communities;


 Training and assistance to MAIs to provide technical outreach and education to communities affected by hazardous
substances; and unique environmental circumstances including environmental justice, risk assessment and communication,
hazardous substance information, and education;

 Practitioner-in-Residence Program, bringing a technical expert to assist faculty and students at MAIs to
identify opportunities and develop programs, etc. 




All technology transfer and training pre-proposals shall define target audience, beneficiaries, and the nature
of the training activities.

In addition to research, the Center has a training and technology transfer program that is designed to complement
Center research. Activities include publication of synergos, a periodical research report; production of educational
videotapes; organization of conferences and seminars; and providing assistance to communities affected by hazardous
waste sites. 


South/Southwest Hazardous Substance Research Center 


The South and Southwest Hazardous Substance Research Center is a consortium led by Louisiana State University and
includes Georgia Institute of Technology and Rice University. The overall research mission of the Center is to provide
short and long-term investigations into the management of hazardous substance problems associated with the Center's
focus area-contaminated sediments and dredged materials-as well as problems unique to EPA Regions 4
and 6. The Center is also responsible for training and technology transfer activities including: community outreach
programs; one-day regulatory update conferences; a quarterly newsletter and technical briefs; an annual symposium
and report; and demonstration and transfer of technologies developed from Center activities. 
Most of the Center research activities are focused on problems with contaminated sediment (CS) and dredged material
(DM). The CS and DM of concern contain organics, metals and conventional pollutants as environmental contaminants
both in the water column and on the bottom of rivers, bayous, lakes, harbors, estuaries, freshwater wetlands and adjoining
regions of the continental shelf. Projects in the CS/DM focus examine source characterization, contaminant transport
and transformation processes, ecological effects and human exposure to chemicals in contaminated sediments and
dredged materials. Specific research projects are currently supported in the areas of: 
 Mobility of radium sediments; 
 Contaminant migration from sediment disposal facilities; 
 Contaminant exchange between sediments and the overlying water via biological and physicochemical processes;

 Biotransformation of contaminated sediments; 
 Plant enzyme mediated remediation of TNT contaminated soils; 
 In-situ monitoring of volatile hydrocarbons; and 
 Dynamics of pollutant-sediment reactions. 


Great Plains/Rocky Mountain Center


Kansas State University leads the twelve institution consortium representing EPA Regions 7 and 8. Participating
universities are Montana State University, South Dakota State University, Utah State University, Haskell Indian
Nations University, Lincoln University and the Universities of Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Utah and Wyoming.
The Center was established in 1989 to conduct research in identification, treatment and reduction of hazardous substances
resulting from agriculture, forestry, mineral and mining processing and other concerns of regional interest. 
The two regions have diverse interests resulting from the grouping of mineral-rich states with those whose principal
industries are agricultural, both crop land and animal husbandry. The Center's mission is focused on contaminated
soils and mining wastes. 
The diversity of interests and the large geographic area are further reflected in the Center's training and technology
program. Much of the Center's efforts support activities which reach large audiences with minimum resources. The
Center provides a repository for printed, visual, audial and photographic materials related to hazardous substance
research. The quarterly newsletter, 

HazTech Transfer, 

is disseminated nationally to more than 5000 addresses. The Community Technical Outreach program serves clients
across the region pair where hazardous substances have become a special concern. A special program to provide public
environmental information and education related hazardous substances is also underway. The Center is developing
a special environmental seminar program to serve the consortium campuses and the general public in the ten states
of EPA Regions 7 and 8. Current projects include: 
 Soil and water contamination by heavy metals associated with mining wastes and other industrial activities;

 Soil and groundwater contamination by organic chemicals from various industrial sources; 
 Improved technologies and methods for characterization and analysis of contaminated soil; 
 Innovative treatment technologies for remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater; and 
 Waste minimization and pollution prevention methods and technologies. 


Western Region Center 


The Western Region Hazardous Substance Research Center is a cooperative activity between Stanford University and
Oregon State University to address critical hazardous substance problems in EPA Regions 9 and 10. The objective of
the Center is to promote_through fundamental and applied research_the development of alternative and advanced
physical, chemical and biological processes for treatment of hazardous substances in the surface and subsurface
environments. Groundwater cleanup and site remediation, with a strong emphasis on biological approaches, represent

<DOCTITLE>New Mexico; Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of New Mexico for full program adequacy determination, public
hearing and public comment period. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of STIR,
adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribe permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and
the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the
permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.



On July 20, 1994, New Mexico applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA has reviewed New
Mexico's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that all portions of New Mexico's MSWLF permit
program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. New Mexico's application for program
adequacy determination is available for public review and comment. 
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has scheduled a public hearing on this determination and will hold the hearing if a sufficient number of
people express interest in participating in the hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within
30 days of the date of publication of this notice. If a public hearing is held, it will take place on the date given below
in the ``DATES'' section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold
the hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the
``CONTACTS'' section below.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


A. Background


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine
the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised
Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal
Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to
be determined adequate.
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives
full approval to a MSWLF program.


B. State of New Mexico 


On July 20, 1994, New Mexico submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA has reviewed New Mexico's application
and has tentatively determined that all portions of New Mexico's Subtitle D program will ensure compliance with the
revised Federal Criteria.
On July 8, 1994, the Solid Waste Management Regulations (EIB/SWMR-4) were adopted by the Environmental Improvement
Board. As required by the New Mexico State Rules Act, NMSA 1978, Section 14-4-5 (1988 Repl. Pamp.), EIB/SWMR-4
was filed with the New Mexico State Records Center and Archives on July 18, 1994, and will be in effect thirty days after
filing or August 17, 1994. NMSA 1978, Section 74-1-9.G. EIB/SWMR-4 was scheduled to be published
in the New Mexico Register on July 30, 1994.
EPA has tentatively determined that New Mexico's application is consistent with the Federal Criteria and will make
a final determination of adequacy after the amended regulations become effective.
The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until October 20, 1994. Copies of New Mexico's
application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this
notice. If there is sufficient public interest, the Agency will hold a public hearing on its tentative determination
on November 4, 1994 at 10 a.m. at the New Mexico Environment Department in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Comments can be submitted
as transcribed from the discussion of the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing.
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during the public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy
for New Mexico's program. EPA's final determination notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination
and a response to all major comments.
New Mexico's solid waste program is not enforceable on Indian lands.
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.






Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

<DOCTITLE>Draft NPDES General Permit for Offshore Oil and Gas Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and State Waters
of Alaska: Arctic NPDES General Permit</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Draft NPDES General Permit.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Regional Administrator, Region 10, is proposing to issue a draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit for oil and gas stratigraphic test and exploration wells on the Alaskan Outer Continental
Shelf and contiguous state waters. The proposed Arctic general permit will authorize offshore oil and gas stratigraphic
test and exploration wells in the federal and state waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Development and production
wells are not authorized to discharge by this general permit.



Unlike previous general permits for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, the Arctic general permit will cover a geographic
area not defined by specific state and federal lease sale tracts. Rather, the area of coverage includes the following:




_Federal waters of the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning basins as defined by the Minerals Management Service
(MMS) (see U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 1992), and

_State waters contiguous to the landward boundary of the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning basins.




The permit will authorize discharges from exploratory operations in all areas offered for lease by the U.S. Department
of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) included in previous general permits issued by EPA for the Beaufort
and Chukchi Seas. This includes federal lease sales 71, 87, 97, and 109; and state lease sales 36, 39, 43, and 43A, Federal/State
lease sale BF; and ``contiguous state lease sales'' which were covered by the modification for the Beaufort Sea II
NPDES general permit (54 FR 39574, September 27, 1989). Additional lease sale areas not previously covered by a permit
will include, but are not limited to, the following: MMS federal lease sales 124 and 126; and state lease sales 65 and
68.

A brief description of the basis for the conditions and requirements of the proposed permit is given in the fact sheet
published below.




PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD: 

Interested persons may submit written comments on the draft general permit to the attention of the Director, Water
Division, at the address below. All comments should include the name, address, and telephone number of the commenter
and a concise statement of the exact basis of any comment and the relevant facts upon which it is based. Comments must
be received by the regional office by November 21, 1994.




PUBLIC HEARING: 

Public hearings on the proposed general permit are tentatively scheduled to be held in Anchorage and Barrow, Alaska.
The Barrow hearing will be held at the North Slope Borough Assembly Chambers on November 2, 1994, from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The Anchorage hearing will be held at the Federal Building, Room 137, 710 ``C'' Street, Anchorage, Alaska on November
3, 1994, from 12 p.m. until 4 p.m. Persons interested in making a statement at the hearing must contact Debra Packard
at the address below or at (206) 553-1266 by 4:00 p.m. on October 24, 1994.



Either or both of the public hearings will be cancelled if insufficient interest is expressed in them. Interested
persons can contact Debra Packard at (206) 553-1266 during the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. PDT on October 25,
1994, to confirm that the hearings will take place. At the hearings, interested persons may submit oral or written
statements concerning the draft general permit.




ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD: 

The administrative record for the draft permit is available for public review at EPA, Region 10, at the address listed
below.

FACT SHEET



I. General Permits and Requests for Individual NPDES Permits



Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (the Act) provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance
with the terms of an NPDES permit. Under EPA's regulations [40 CFR 122.28(a)(2)], EPA may issue a single general permit
to a category of point sources located within the same geographic area if the regulated point sources:




_Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;

_Discharge the same types of wastes;

_Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions;

_Require similar monitoring requirements; and

_In the opinion of the Regional Administrator, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under
individual permits.




In addition, under EPA regulations [40 CFR 122.28(c)(1)], the Regional Administrator shall issue general permits
covering discharges from offshore oil and gas facilities within the Region's jurisdiction. Where the offshore area
includes areas for which separate permit conditions are required, such as areas of environmental concern, a separate
individual or general permit may be required by the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator has determined
that exploratory oil and gas facilities operating in the area described in this general NPDES permit are more appropriately
controlled by a general permit than by individual permits.

Any owner and/or operator authorized to discharge under a general permit may request to be excluded from coverage
under the general permit by applying for an individual permit as provided by 40 CFR 122.28(b). The operator shall submit
an application together with the reasons supporting the request to the Director, Water Division, EPA, Region 10 (``Director'').
A source located within a general permit area, excluded from coverage under the general permit solely because it already
has an individual permit (i.e., a permit that has not been continued under the Administrative Procedure Act), may
request that its individual permit be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the
individual permit, the general permit shall apply. Procedures for modification, revocation, termination, and
processing of NPDES permits are provided by 40 CFR 122.62-122.64. As in the case of individual permits, violation
of any condition of a general permit constitutes a violation of the Act that is enforceable under Section 309 of the
Act.

II. Covered Facilities and Nature of Discharges


A. Types of Discharges Authorized


The proposed general permit will authorize the following discharges from exploratory offshore oil and gas operations:
Drilling mud and drilling cuttings; deck drainage; sanitary wastes; domestic wastes; desalination unit wastes;
blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown; fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water; uncontaminated
ballast water; uncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; mud, cuttings, and cement at the seafloor; and
test fluids. Drilling muds and cuttings are the major pollutant sources discharged from exploratory operations.
Further description of discharges are given in Part V below. When issued, the proposed general permit will establish
effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions, and other conditions on the authorized discharges from the facilities
covered. 


B. Types of Facilities Covered 


The general permit proposed today authorizes the discharge of specific operational wastewaters from offshore exploratory
oil and gas operations located in federal and state waters. In order to be authorized to discharge under this permit,
the operator of such exploratory operations must be registered with EPA as the NPDES permittee. Development and production
operations are not covered by this general permit. Exploratory operations are defined as those operations involving
the drilling of wells to determine the nature of potential hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration facilities covered
by this general permit are included in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category
(40 CFR part 435, subpart A). Under the proposed permit, the number of wells from which discharges may occur is limited
to a maximum of five at a single site. 


C. Areas Covered


The area of coverage under previous general permits for offshore oil and gas activities in Alaska was linked directly
to federal or state lease sales. For a variety of reasons, EPA is now planning to tie the area of coverage to MMS planning
basins and all contiguous state waters. This method of defining the area of coverage will ensure that all areas likely
to be leased during the term of this general permit will be covered. While the planning basins are generally larger
than the specific sale areas offered for lease by MMS, discharges under this permit would occur in only those areas
successfully leased. EPA believes that this is a more practicable way of addressing the area of coverage. 
Hence, areas covered by the proposed Arctic NPDES general permit include the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning
basins as defined by MMS (U.S. Department of the Interior, 1992), and state waters contiguous to the landward boundary
of the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning basins. The general permit does not authorize discharges into any wetlands
adjacent to the territorial waters of Alaska or from facilities in the Onshore or Coastal Subcategories as defined
in 40 CFR Part 435. 



III. Statutory Basis for Permit Conditions


Sections 301(b), 304, 306, 307, 308, 401, 402, 403, and 501 of the Clean Water Act (The Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987), 33 U.S.C. 1311, 1314
(b), (c), and (e), 1316, 1317, 1318 and 1361; 86 Stat. 816, Public Law 92-500; 91 Stat. 1567, Public Law 95-217;
101 Stat. 7, Public Law 100-4 (``the Act'' or ``CWA''), and the U.S. Coast Guard regulations (33 CFR Part 151),
provide the basis for the permit conditions contained in the permit. The general requirements of these Sections fall
into three categories, which are described below. A discussion of the basis for specific permit conditions follows
in Section V of this fact sheet.



A. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations



1. BPT Effluent Limitations



The Act requires particular classes of industrial dischargers to meet effluent limitations established by EPA.
EPA promulgated effluent limitations guidelines requiring Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available
(BPT) for the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category (40 CFR part 435, subpart A)
on April 13, 1979 (44 FR 22069).

BPT effluent limitations guidelines require ``no discharge of free oil'' for discharges of deck drainage, drilling
muds, drill cuttings, and well treatment fluids. This limitation requires that a discharge shall not cause a film
or sheen upon or discoloration on the surface of the water or adjoining shorelines, or cause a sludge or emulsion to
be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shorelines [40 CFR 435.11(d)]. The BPT guidelines
for sanitary waste require that the concentration of chlorine be maintained as close to 1 milligrams/liter as possible
in discharges from facilities housing ten or more persons. For facilities continuously staffed by nine or fewer persons
or only intermittently staffed by any number of persons, the BPT guideline for sanitary waste require no discharge
of floating solids. A ``no floating solids'' guideline also applies to domestic waste.

2. BAT and BCT Effluent Limitations



As soon as practicable but in no case later than March 31, 1989, all permits are required by Section 301(b)(2) of the
Act to contain effluent limitations for all categories and classes of point sources which: (1) Control toxic pollutants
(40 CFR 401.15) and nonconventional pollutants through the use of Best Available Technology Economically Achievable
(BAT), and (2) represent Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT). BCT effluent limitations apply
to conventional pollutants (Ph, BOD, oil and grease, suspended solids, and fecal coliform). In no case may BCT or BAT
be less stringent than BPT. 
BAT and BCT effluent limitations guidelines and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for offshore oil and gas
operations were proposed on August 26, 1985 (50 FR 34592) and signed on January 15, 1993 (58 FR 12454, March 4, 1993).
The new guidelines were established under the authority of Sections 301(b), 304, 306, 307, 308, and 501 of the Act.
The new guidelines were also established in response to a Consent Decree entered on April 5, 1990 (subsequently modified
on May 28, 1992) in 

NRDC 

v. 

Reilly, 

D. D.C. No. 79-3442 (JHP) and are consistent with EPA's Effluent Guidelines Plan under Section 304(m) of the
CWA (57 FR 41000, September 8, 1992). This permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations based upon the BAT
and BCT effluent limitations guidelines. 
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are not incorporated in this general permit. Per the guidelines, NSPS are
not applicable to exploratory oil and gas operations (58 FR 12457, March 4, 1993). Exploratory operations are defined
in the preamble to the guidelines as ``new dischargers'' (rather than ``new sources'') on the basis that they do not
constitute ``significant site preparation''. NSPS do apply to certain development and production, but not exploratory,
operations. 

This will be the first oil and gas general permit issued by Region 10 incorporating the new effluent limitation guidelines.
Offshore exploratory oil and gas wastestreams for which there are new BAT and BCT effluent guidelines include: Drilling
fluids and cuttings, deck drainage, sanitary waste, and domestic wastes. This permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent
limitations from the guidelines for the aforementioned wastestreams (see also Sections IV and V below). Based upon
EPA's best professional judgement, limitations on test fluids have been established to reflect guidelines applicable
to produced water. 

The new effluent guidelines do not specifically address other wastestreams controlled by this permit (e.g., desalination
unit wastes; blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown; fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water;
uncontaminated ballast water; uncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; and muds, cuttings, cement at
seafloor). In the absence of effluent limitation guidelines for these wastestreams, permit conditions must be established
using Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) procedures (40 CFR Sections 122.43, 122.44, and 125.3). As with previous
oil and gas general permits issued by Region 10, this permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations based on
the Agency's Best Professional Judgement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As required by Section 304(b)(2)(B) of the Act, in developing the BPJ/BAT permit conditions, the Agency considered
the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of
various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achieving such effluent reduction, non-water
quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Director deemed appropriate.

The types of equipment and processes employed in exploratory drilling operations are well known to the Agency. Region
10 has issued numerous general and individual permits for exploratory oil and gas operations. The records for this
permit and those earlier permits thoroughly discuss the types of equipment, facilities and processes employed in
exploratory drilling operations. 
With regard to the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, there are no BAT
permit limitations based on installation of control equipment. BAT permit limitations based on the newly issued
guidelines can be achieved through product substitution for drilling muds and cuttings. Any costs of achieving the
effluent limitations and any non-water quality environmental impacts were also evaluated by the Agency where the
guidelines are applicable. A discussion of such evaluations is presented below with respect to any limitation where
applicable. 

As required by Section 304(b)(4)(B) of the Act, the same factors as in BAT are considered in determining BCT permit
conditions, with one exception. Rather than considering ``the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,'' any
BCT determination includes ``consideration of the reasonableness of the relationship between the costs of attaining
a reduction in effluents and the effluent reduction benefits derived, and the comparison of the cost and level of reduction
of such pollutants from publicly owned treatment works to the cost and level of reduction of such pollutants from a
class or category of industrial sources.'' BCT effluent limitations cannot be less stringent than BPT; therefore,
if the candidate industrial technology fails the BCT ``cost test'', BCT effluent limitations are set equal to BPT.




B. Ocean Discharge Criteria 



Section 403 of the Act requires that an NPDES permit for a discharge into marine waters located seaward of the inner
boundary of the territorial seas be issued in accordance with guidelines for determining the degradation of the marine
environment. These guidelines, referred to as the Ocean Discharge Criteria (40 CFR part 125, subpart M), and section
403 of the Act are intended to ``prevent unreasonable degradation of the marine environment and to authorize imposition
of effluent limitations, including a prohibition of discharge, if necessary, to ensure this goal.'' (45 FR 65942,
October 3, 1980) 

If EPA determines that the discharge will cause unreasonable degradation, an NPDES permit will not be issued. If a
determination of unreasonable degradation cannot be made because of a lack of sufficient information, EPA must then
determine whether a discharge will cause irreparable harm to the marine environment and whether there are reasonable
alternatives to on-site disposal. To assess the probability of irreparable harm, EPA is required to make a determination
that the discharger, operating under appropriate permit conditions, will not cause permanent and significant harm
to the environment during a monitoring period in which additional information is gathered. If data gathered through
monitoring indicate that continued discharge may cause unreasonable degradation, the discharge must be halted
or additional permit limitations established.

The Director has concluded that there is sufficient information to determine that exploratory oil and gas facilities
operating under the effluent limitations and conditions in this general permit will not cause unreasonable degradation
of the marine environment pursuant to the Ocean Discharge Criteria guidelines as long as discharge does not occur
shoreward of the 5 meter isobath (Tetra Tech, 1994a) as discussed in Section V.B.4. of this fact sheet. Conditions
imposed under Section 403(c) of the Act are discussed in Section V.B.4. below. 



C. State of Alaska Standards and Limitations



All dischargers to State waters must ensure compliance with water quality standards and with limitations imposed
by the state as part of its certification of NPDES permits under Section 401 of the Act. The state waters of the Beaufort
and Chukchi Seas have been classified by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) as marine waters
with water use classes 2A through 2D (water supply; water recreation; growth and propagation of fish, shellfish,
other aquatic life, and wildlife; and harvesting for consumption of raw mollusks or other raw aquatic life). In the
best professional judgement of Region 10, the requirements and discharge limitations in the proposed permit will
ensure compliance with the state water quality standards. 
In issuing this permit, EPA has considered Alaska's antidegradation policy (18 AAC 70.010(c)). The exploratory
discharges authorized under this proposed permit are expected to have minimal impact because:




_The relatively short duration of exploratory activities,
_The intermittent nature of the discharges,
_The limited areal extent of the discharges relative to the total area of coverage, and
_The controls placed on the discharges via the proposed NPDES permit.




Given the above, and since the project is not expected to result in any violations of state water quality criteria,
EPA believes the project complies with the state's antidegradation policy. 



D. Section 308 of the Clean Water Act



Section 308 of the Act and 40 CFR 122.44(i) authorizes the Director to require a discharger to conduct monitoring to
determine compliance with effluent limitations and to assist in the development of effluent limitations. EPA has
included several monitoring requirements in this permit, as listed in the table below in Section V. 



IV. Summary of New or Changed Permit Conditions



This section of the fact sheet is intended to provide readers with a brief summary of the parts of the general permit
which are substantively different from the previous general permits for offshore oil and gas exploratory activities
in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. For detailed discussion of the requirements and their bases, please refer to Section
V of this fact sheet. Many of the new and changed requirements are a consequence of the final Effluent Limitations Guidelines
and New Source Performance Standards for the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category
promulgated by EPA (see 40 CFR part 435, subpart A).

Drilling Muds and Drilling Cuttings



_Combination of wastestreams: In accordance with the guidelines, drilling muds, drilling cuttings and washwater
have been combined into a single discharge wastestream called drilling fluids and drilling cuttings (Discharge
001). Washwater had previously been combined with drilling cuttings in a separate wastestream but washwater is now
covered as an intrinsic component of the drilling muds and cuttings wastestream. 
_Discharge prohibitions: Under Section 403(c) of the Act, discharge of drilling muds and cuttings is prohibited
to waters shallower than 5 meters depth in accordance with computer modeling done in preparation for this proposed
permit. Previously discharge had been prohibited in waters shallower than 2 meters. 
_Toxicity limit: A toxicity limit of a minimum of 30,000 ppm suspended particulate phase (SPP) has been applied to
the discharge in accordance with the guidelines. 
_Oil content: In accordance with the guidelines, EPA has eliminated the 10% by weight maximum oil limitation on cuttings
in favor of the no free oil limitation. 
_Barite: EPA has maintained the limitations on the mercury and cadmium content of stock barite but has eliminated
the case-by-case waiver option present in previous permits. This waiver option has been eliminated to ensure consistency
with the effluent guidelines.

_Mud Plan: EPA has included a requirement that a mud plan be developed by operators to encourage operators to estimate
in advance the toxicity of the drilling muds and cuttings to ensure compliance with the toxicity limitation. The individual
NPDES permit recently issued to Arco Alaska for operations in Cook Inlet contains a similar requirement. 
_Area and Seasonal Restrictions: In addition to several continued restrictions, based on Section 403(c) of the Act
the proposed permit also prohibits discharges within 3 miles of Kasegaluk Lagoon and its passes. 
_Environmental monitoring: The requirements for environmental monitoring are more specific and detailed. These
changes reflect the current level of specificity present in other NPDES permits issued by Region 10. 



Domestic Wastes



_Garbage (``All other domestic waste''): Under the Coast Guard Regulations, discharges of garbage, including plastics,
are prohibited with one exception. Victual or food waste can be discharged with restrictions. This requirement reflects
the new offshore guidelines (58 FR 12506, March 4, 1993). Several definitions have been included to clarify this new
effluent parameter. 



Test Fluids



_Oil and grease: Per EPA's best professional judgement and the new guidelines, the oil and grease limitation on test
fluids has been made more stringent. The limitations are now 29 mg/l monthly average and 42 mg/l daily maximum. 



Discharge Limitations for All Wastestreams



_Rubbish, Trash and Other Refuse: As proposed the permit will prohibit the discharge of ``garbage'' including food
wastes within 12 nautical miles of nearest land. With restrictions, comminuted food waste may be discharged further
than 12 nautical miles from nearest land. Under the proposed permit these limitations, which are already effective
under the Coast Guard regulations, will be incorporated into the Arctic general permit for consistency purposes.




Best Management Practice Plan Requirement



_The proposed general permit requires permittees to develop and implement a Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan
which prevents or minimizes the generation of pollutants, their release, and potential release from the permitted
facilities to the waters of the United States.



V. Specific Permit Conditions



A. Approach



The determination of appropriate conditions for each discharge was accomplished through: 
(1) consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control conventional pollutants under BCT; 
(2) consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control toxic and nonconventional pollutants under
BAT; and 
(3) evaluation of the Ocean Discharge Criteria for discharges, assuming conditions in (1) and (2), above, were in
place. 

Discussions of the specific effluent limitations and monitoring requirements derived from (1) through (3) appear
below in sections B. through G. For convenience, these conditions and the regulatory basis for each are cross-referenced
by discharge in the following table:

B. Drilling Muds and Drill Cuttings 



The term ``drilling fluid'' generally includes all compositions of fluids used to aid the production and removal
of cuttings (particles from geological formations) from a borehole in the earth. The essential functions of drilling
fluids are: 




_To carry cuttings to the surface, 

_To cool and clean drill bit, 

_To reduce friction in the borehole, 

_To maintain pressure balance between formation and borehole in uncased sections of hole, and 

_To assist in collection and interpretation of information available from cuttings, cores, electrical logs, etc.





All drilling fluids fall into one of three classes: gas-based (e.g., mist or foam), water-based, or oil-based. When
the main component of the drilling fluid is liquid (i.e., water or oil), it is referred to as ``mud''. All of Region 10's
previous permits address only the discharge of muds, as gas fluids are not used in Alaskan offshore or coastal drilling
operations. As discussed below in subsections 1 and 2, the discharge of oil-based muds (with oil as the continuous
phase and water as the dispersed phase) is prohibited because they do not comply with the no free oil limitation. 

The Agency understands that non-petroleum hydrocarbon organic liquids are being developed as an alternate to gas,
water or hydrocarbon (e.g., diesel or mineral) oil-based drilling muds. The Agency invites comments on the applicability
and feasibility of such muds to exploratory drilling operations in the offshore Arctic. 



1. BCT Limitations on Drilling Muds and Cuttings 





Free oil and oil-based muds: 

No discharge of free oil is permitted from the discharge of drilling mud and drill cuttings, based upon the guidelines.
The technology basis for this limitation is substitution of water-based drilling fluids in place of oil-based muds,
non-petroleum oil-containing additives, and minimization of the use of mineral oil. When this substitution is not
possible, the guidelines contemplated that the technology basis was also transportation and discharge onshore.
Free oil is being regulated under BAT as an ``indicator'' pollutant for the control of toxic pollutants. Although
it is not a listed conventional pollutant, as is oil and grease, free oil is also limited as a surrogate for oil and grease
under BCT. 

The discharge of oil-based drilling fluids is prohibited since discharge of oil-based fluids would violate the effluent
limitations of no discharge of free oil. 

Compliance with the free oil limitation will be monitored by use of the Static Sheen Test (see 40 CFR part 435, appendix
1 to subpart A) daily and before bulk discharges. Region 10 has required the use of the Static Sheen Test in previous
permits because visual observation of the discharge for sheen upon the receiving water will not prevent violations
of the standard. This test is also appropriate for the harsh weather and extended periods of darkness common in Alaska.


Previous Region 10 permits have contained an oil content limitation on drill cuttings. However, this approach has
been rejected in favor of the no free oil limitation contained in the guidelines. As discussed at 56 FR 10682 and 56 FR
10685 (March 13, 1991), the Agency rejected an oil content limitation based on cuttings washing treatment technologies
because limitations on other parameters (diesel oil, free oil, and toxicity) are sufficient to reduce toxics from
drilling wastes. Because the no free oil limitation is more stringent than the 10% by weight limitation on the oil content
of cuttings, this change does not invoke antibacksliding provisions (see 40 CFR 122.44(l)(2)). 



2. BAT Limitations on Drilling Muds and Cuttings 





Toxicity: 

Region 10 is proposing to incorporate an effluent toxicity limit of minimum 96-hour LC

50

 of 30,000 ppm suspended particulate phase (SPP) on discharged drilling muds and cuttings. This limit is designed
to be a technology-based control on toxicity, as well as toxic and nonconventional pollutants. The 30,000 ppm SPP
limitation is based on the Agency's evaluation that it constitutes an economically and technically achievable level
of performance and is both technologically feasible and economically achievable and reflects BAT level of control
(U.S. EPA, 1993a) on a national basis. This limitation is present in the general permit for the Western Gulf of Mexico
(57 FR 54652, November 19, 1992). The toxicity limit is also present in a recently issued individual NPDES permit for
ARCO Alaska operations in Cook Inlet.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The purpose of this limitation is to encourage the use of water-based or other low toxicity drilling fluids and additives.
This toxicity criterion became BAT when the final effluent guidelines were signed January 15, 1993 (58 FR 12469, March
4, 1993). 

The toxicity limit is an end-of-pipe discharge limit; and represents a different approach to controlling this wastestream
than has been applied in previous general permits issued by Region 10. When the Region issued its first general permits
under the proposed guidelines, it developed a case-by-case approach to limiting the toxicity of discharged mud/additive
systems as BPJ determination of BAT until guidelines could be promulgated. Region 10 used the 30,000 ppm SPP value
as a criterion in evaluating available bioassay data for the proposed discharges. The process of evaluating each
mud/additive system with respect to the discharge toxicity constituted BPJ determination of BAT. Since the guidelines
have now been promulgated with a toxicity limitation for drilling muds and cuttings, Region 10 will be discontinuing
the mud preapproval process in favor of the end-of-pipe limitation. 

Compliance with the drilling mud toxicity limit will be determined by using the Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test (see
appendix 2 to subpart A of part 435, 58 FR 12507, March 4, 1993). At a minimum, monitoring is to be done on a monthly basis
for each well. When the end-of-well is reached, a final bioassay analysis will be required (see Part II.A.1.k. of permit).
The last monthly bioassay may constitute the end-of-well bioassay. If a mineral oil pill is required (Part II.A.1.g.
of permit), the mud shall be sampled for bioassay prior to application of the pill

 and 

after removal of the pill. Complete bioassay reports are required as part of the regulatory record for each well. 



Diesel oil: 

The discharge of drilling muds and cuttings which have been contaminated by diesel oil is prohibited by the Agency,
in accordance with the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12469, March 4, 1993). The prohibition on the
discharge of diesel oil has been part of all of the general NPDES permits issued by Region 10 for the Offshore and Coastal
Subcategories. Diesel oil, which is sometimes added to a water-based mud system, is a complex mixture of petroleum
hydrocarbons, known to be highly toxic to marine organisms and to contain numerous toxic and nonconventional pollutants.
The pollutant ``diesel oil'' is being used as an ``indicator'' of the listed toxic pollutants present in diesel oil
which are controlled through compliance with the effluent limitation (i.e., no discharge). The technology basis
for this limitation is product substitution of less toxic mineral oil for diesel oil. 



Mercury and Cadmium in Barite: 

In accordance with the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12469, March 4, 1993), the proposed permit contains
limitations of 1 mg/kg mercury and 3 mg/kg cadmium in barite. Barite is a major constituent of drilling muds. These
restrictions on drilling fluid influent are designed to limit the discharge of mercury, cadmium, and other potentially
toxic metals in the drilling fluid effluent, since these metals can occur as contaminants in some sources of barite.
The justification for the limitation under BAT is product substitution or transportation and disposal of the waste
onshore. That is, operators can substitute ``clean'' barite, which meets the above limitations, for contaminated
barite, which does not meet the limitations. Numerous offshore exploratory wells and the production wells drilled
under permits previously issued by Region 10 have been drilled subject to this requirement. Chemical analyses have
shown that the barite used has not exceeded the limitations. Further discussion on the mercury and cadmium limits
in barite is presented in the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12479-80, March 4, 1993) and in the development
document (U.S. EPA, 1993a). 

EPA has eliminated a waiver provision for the barite limits which was in the previous permits. The waiver stipulated
that if a permittee was unable to comply with the barite limitations due to the lack of availability of barite which
meets the limitation, then the permittee could request a case-by-case waiver allowing the discharge of barite which
exceeded the limits (53 FR 37858, September 28, 1988). As a part of the effluent guidelines development, EPA investigated
the availability of domestic and foreign supplies of barite to meet the cadmium and mercury limits. The Agency also
considered the potential for the increased demand for clean barite stocks resulting from this rule to cause a rise
in the cost of barite. (See the Development Document (U.S. EPA, 1993a) and the Economic Impact Analysis (U.S. EPA,
1993d) for detailed discussion on the availability and economic availability.) EPA concluded that ``there are sufficient
supplies of barite capable of meeting the limits of this rule to meet the needs of offshore drilling operations (58
FR 12480, March 4, 1993). Hence, the waiver provision has not been included in this proposed general permit. 



3. Section 308 Documentation and Monitoring Requirements for Muds and Cuttings 









</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00061 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00027 </PARENT>

The following reporting and discharge monitoring requirements are based on Section 308 of the Act and 40 CFR 122.44(i).
These requirements serve to determine compliance with, or the possible future need for, effluent limitations in
the permit.




_Chemical analysis 
_Chemical inventory 
_Monitoring volume discharged 
_Mud plan




The requirement of a mud plan is new and is explained below. The first three requirements have been present in previous
NPDES general permits for all coastal and offshore operations in Region 10. The chemical analysis requirement has
been expanded to require analysis of total recoverable metal concentration, in addition to total metal concentration.
Analyses are to be conducted on split samples. This requirement has been included to enable the Agency to better evaluate
the impact of metals in the mud discharges. 



Mud Plans: 

As previously noted, Region 10 plans to discontinue authorization of mud/additive systems. Instead EPA is shifting
the responsibility of case-by-case evaluations from the Region to the operator. Resources do not allow Region 10
to continue to perform case-by-case evaluations or to issue discharge authorizations for each drilling mud/additive
system. Hence, the proposed permit contains a requirement that the permittee develop, have on-site, and available
upon request a plan for discharge of drilling muds and additives (hereafter called ``mud plan''). This requirement
is analogous to analyses that the region has been performing in development of drilling mud authorizations. 

The basis for the mud plan requirement is Section 308(a)(A) of the Act which provides that EPA may require the permittee
to establish and maintain records and/or reports that will assist the Region to determine compliance with other requirements
and effluent limitations of the permit. The mud plan is one component of the Best Management Practices Plan (see Part
II.F.4.d.(4) of the permit). The mud plan requirement is also based upon the Pollution Prevention Act and its policy
of prevention, reduction, recycling, and treatment of wastes (PPA Section 102(b)) through measures which include
process modification, materials substitution, and improvement of management (PPA Section 107(b)(3)).

The goal of requiring development of a mud plan is to ensure that personnel on-site are knowledgeable about the information
needed and the methods required to formulate the mud/additive systems in order to meet the effluent toxicity limit.
Simply put, the mud plan is intended to be a written guide to planning for, and using, a mud/additive system in compliance
with the permit. 

Region 10's case-by-case approach to evaluating discharge of mud/additive systems coupled with use of worst case
cumulative toxicity estimates as bases for authorization, has been conducive to the discharge of muds with lower
toxicity than elsewhere in the OCS. To date Alaskan operators have demonstrated that thorough planning and evaluation
of mud/additive systems with respect to possible cumulative toxicity does consistently result in discharge of muds
that are less toxic than the 30,000 ppm SPP limit. 

The mud plan is intended to demonstrate that the discharged mud/additive system for the well in question will meet
the effluent limit of 30,000 ppm SPP based on the following decision criteria:




_Estimates of worst case cumulative discharge toxicity (either calculated or actual toxicity test results);

_Estimates of toxicity of discharged mud when a mineral oil pill has been used; and 

_Use of less toxic alternatives where possible.




The mud plan shall also include a clearly stated procedure for dealing with situations in which additives not originally
planned for are needed at the ``last minute.'' This procedure should enable drilling and mud personnel to determine
whether an additive or mud component may be added to the circulating mud system without significant effect upon the
discharge toxicity. Criteria for reaching this type of ``last minute'' additive decision shall be clearly specified
in the mud plan.

In addition to developing the mud plan, the operator is also required to certify that the mud plan is complete, on-site,
and available upon request (see Part II.A.1.f. of the permit).

Certification is due no later than submission of their written notice of intent to commence discharge (see Part I.C.
of the permit). 



4. Section 403(c) Requirements for Muds and Cuttings





Depth-related Restrictions: 

Additional restrictions on these discharges are necessary to ensure no unreasonable degradation of the environment.
The area of coverage includes water depths from 5 to about 3,000 meters deep. Discharge rate limitations on total muds
and cuttings have been established in the ocean discharge criteria evaluation process in order to allow adequate
dispersion of the discharges. These maximum rates are:




_No discharge in waters less than 5 meters deep, 
_500 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 5 meters but not more than 20 meters in depth, 
_750 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 20 meters but not more than 40 meters in depth, and 
_1,000 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 40 meters in depth.




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These limits are necessary because for any given discharge rate, the dilution of drilling muds and cuttings is not
as great in shallow waters as in deeper waters. However, at any particular water depth, greater dilution close to the
discharge point will be achieved with a lower discharge rate. These maximum rates will ensure that the water quality
standards will not be exceeded at the edge of the 100 meters mixing zone (Tetra Tech, 1994a). 
Previous permits have allowed the discharge of drilling muds and cuttings between 2 and 5 meters depth. However, computer
modeling of the dispersion of the drilling muds conducted for this permit in 2-5 meters depth did not perform
adequately (Tetra Tech, 1994a). The maximum depth of mud accumulation for these cases was 10-20 times greater
than the water depth. Mud accumulations of this magnitude would effectively bury the drilling mud outfall, making
any calculation of dilution values meaningless. Accordingly, EPA is proposing zero discharge of muds and cuttings
in waters less than 5 meters deep. 



Areal Restrictions: 

Discharge of muds and cuttings are prohibited in the following four areas: 
(a) Between the shore (mainland and barrier islands) and the 5 meters isobath, 
(b) within 1000 meters of river mouths or deltas during unstable or broken ice or open water conditions, 
(c) Within 1000 meters of the Stefansson Sound Boulder Patch, and 
(d) Within 3 miles of Kasegaluk Lagoon or the passes of Kasegaluk Lagoon. 

For the specific requirements, see Parts II.A.3. of the permit. In accordance with 40 CFR 125.123 (c), the Director
has prohibited these discharges because the Region has determined they may cause unreasonable degradation of the
marine environment. Prohibition (a) has changed from previous permits as described in the previous section of this
fact sheet. Prohibitions (b) and (c) are contained in the previous Beaufort Sea NPDES general permits (49 FR 23734,
June 7, 1984 and 53 FR 37846, September 28, 1988). This is the first time that a provision concerning Kasegaluk Lagoon
has been included in a general permit for offshore oil and gas exploration since the area has never been covered by an
NPDES permit for exploratory oil and gas operations. 
With regard to (a) and (b) above, EPA has extensively studied the nearshore zone of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea in several
Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluations (Tetra Tech, 1994a; Jones & Stokes, 1983, 1984). These evaluations have
clearly shown that these nearshore areas provide important feeding and migratory habitat for a large number of species
including fish, waterfowl, and mammals. Further, these areas provide essential feeding and preferred habitat for
species of major importance for subsistence and commercial fisheries. 
Concerning (c) above, the proposed permit does not authorize discharges within 1000 meters of the Stefansson Sound
Boulder Patch as defined by Dunton et al. (1982). The ``Patch'' is a rare and unique biological community that is susceptible
to adverse effects caused by discharged drilling muds and cuttings. 
As noted in (d) above, the proposed permit restricts activity near Kasegaluk Lagoon and its barrier island system.
Specifically discharge is prohibited within Kasegaluk Lagoon and in the waters within 3 miles of the following passes
intensively used by the beluga whales: Kukpowruk Pass, Akunik Pass, Utukok Pass, Icy Cape Pass, and Alokiakatat Pass.
This restriction is in accordance with the North Slope Borough's Coastal Management Program (NSB, 1988). The NSB
recognizes Kasegaluk Lagoon as a Candidate Area Meriting Special Attention (AMSA) and imposes the above restrictions.


Kasegaluk Lagoon extends for approximately 140 miles along the Chukchi Sea coast. About 90 miles of the lagoon is south
of Icy Cape and the rest is north of Icy Cape. Kasegaluk Lagoon is located in state waters of the Chukchi Sea and provides
important habitat for spotted seals and beluga whales. Beluga whales are known to feed, calve and may molt in this lagoon
(North Slope Borough, 1988; Frost and Lowry, 1993; Tetra Tech, 1994a). Spotted seals also calve in Kasegaluk Lagoon
(NSB, 1988). The lagoon also provides important feeding, migrating, and rearing areas for marine and anadromous
fish, as well as migratory birds.

Kasegaluk Lagoon, the barrier islands, and the nearshore waters seaward of the barrier islands are an important subsistence
area for the villagers of Point Lay (NSB, 1988). Subsistence activities that occur seasonally in the Kasegaluk Lagoon
Candidate AMSA area include egg gathering, waterfowl hunting, sealing, fishing, walrus hunting, and whaling for
belugas. This proposed permit and the Borough's management program recognizes the importance of the area for marine
mammals, seabirds, and subsistence activities.

Environmental Monitoring: 

Environmental monitoring is required in two areas which are of particular concern to Region 10: discharge of drilling
muds and cuttings below-ice to water depths shallower than 20 meters and within 1000 meters of an area of biological
concern (i.e., a unique biological community or habitat). The Director has determined that controlled discharges
to these areas, in accordance with 40 CFR 125.123(a) and the limitations and conditions in the draft permit, will not
cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment. Environmental monitoring is required to verify that
discharges to these areas will not produce conditions in the future that would lead to unreasonable degradation.



C. Deck Drainage (Discharge 002) 


Deck drainage includes all waste resulting from deck washings, spillage, rainwater, and run-off from gutters and
drains including drip pans and work areas. Oil and grease are the primary pollutants identified in deck drainage.
In addition to oil, various other chemicals used in drilling operations may be present. Specific conventional, toxic,
and non-conventional pollutants found in deck drainage are controlled by the prohibition on the discharge of free
oil. Deck drainage discharges are not continuous and can vary significantly in volume. 


Free oil: 

EPA is controlling pollutants found in deck drainage by the prohibition on the discharge of free oil. This limit is
the current BPT level of control and is also the appropriate level of control under BCT and BAT. No free oil is permitted
from the discharge of deck drainage in accordance with the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12506, March
4, 1993). Deck drainage was subject to this limitation in the previous permits issued by Region 10 and past practices
have not resulted in violations of this limit. 
Compliance with the free oil limitation for deck drainage will be by visual observation for a sheen on the receiving
water as mandated by the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12506, March 4, 1993), except under the conditions described
below. The Static Sheen Test will also be required for the monitoring of deck drainage during unstable or broken ice
and stable ice conditions. Use of the Static Sheen Test will prevent a violation of the free oil limitation in those
discharges most likely to be contaminated with oil. This would not be possible with an after-the-fact visual observation
of a sheen on the receiving water. This requirement is similar to requirements in the Region's previous permits and
will not result in any additional costs to the industry. 


Flow Rate: 

Flow rate is required to be estimated monthly. The basis for this requirement is Section 308 of the Act. 


D. Sanitary Wastes (Discharge 003) 


The sanitary wastes from offshore oil and gas facilities are made up of human body wastes from the toilets and urinals.
The volume and concentrations of these wastes vary widely with time, occupancy, platform characteristics, and operational
status (U.S. EPA, 1993a). 


Floating Solids: 

The prohibition on floating solids is mandated by the offshore oil and gas guidelines for facilities intermittently
manned or continuously manned by fewer than 10 persons (58 FR 12470, March 4, 1993). This requirement does not specifically
apply to facilities continuously manned by 10 or more persons (however, the method of compliance with the residual
chlorine limit effectively limits floating solids for these facilities). Since previous permits for exploratory
operations in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas have prohibited the discharge of floating solids for all facilities regardless
of staffing, Region 10 is continuing the requirement in this permit based upon antibacksliding provisions [40 CFR
122.44(l)(2)]. This BCT prohibition on the discharge of floating solids is equivalent to the current level of control
for sanitary wastes in previous permits. 


Residual Chlorine: 

Chlorine is regulated by the Agency in the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines as a conventional pollutant. Chlorine
is added to the wastestream to control fecal coliforms in the discharge. Facilities continuously manned by 10 or more
persons are required to have a residual chlorine content of 1 milligram per liter (and maintained as close to the limit
as possible). This limitation has been in previous Region 10 permits and is in the proposed permit as well. 
For facilities with fewer than 10 persons or intermittently staffed by any number of persons (i.e., M91M facilities),
the proposed permit prohibits the discharge of floating solids only, with no chlorine limitation.

E. Domestic Wastes (Discharge 004) 


Domestic wastes refers to materials discharged from sinks, showers, laundries, safety showers, eyewash stations,
and galleys. Because domestic wastes do not contain fecal coliform, chlorination is not required. 


Floating Solids: 

Under BCT, EPA is prohibiting the discharge of floating solids. The limitation is included in the offshore oil and
gas guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4, 1993) and is equivalent to the current level of control for sanitary wastes in
the previous permits. 


Visible Foam: 

Discharges of visible foam are prohibited under BAT in the offshore oil and gas guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4, 1993).
This limitation is equivalent to the current level of control for domestic wastes in existing permits and past practices
have not resulted in violations of this limitation. 


All other domestic waste: 

This permit includes requirements limiting the discharge of all other domestic waste (garbage) as included in U.S.
Coast Guard regulations at 33 CFR part 151. These limitations are a new feature in EPA offshore oil and gas permits for
Beaufort and Chukchi Seas operators and reflect the offshore oil and gas effluent guidelines (58 FR 12487, March 4,
1993). The requirements on garbage are currently included in the most recent reissuance of the Western Gulf of Mexico
general permit (57 FR 54654, November 19, 1992). 
As proposed, the reissued permit will prohibit the discharge of garbage including food wastes within 12 nautical
miles from nearest land. Comminuted food waste which is able to pass through a screen with a mesh size no larger than
25 mm (approximately 1 inch) may be discharged 12 or more nautical miles from nearest land. Incineration ash and non-plastic
clinkers that can pass through a 25 mm mesh screen may be discharged beyond 3 miles from nearest land, otherwise ash
and non-plastic clinkers can only be discharged beyond 12 nautical miles from nearest land. 
Since this BCT limitation already exists in Coast Guard regulations and other NPDES permits, it will not result in
any additional compliance cost, or additional non-water quality environmental impacts. There are no incremental
costs associated with the limitation. 


F. Miscellaneous Discharges: 


Desalination unit wastes (005), blowout preventer fluid (006), boiler blowdown (007), fire control system test
water (008), non-contact cooling water (009), uncontaminated ballast water (010), uncontaminated bilge water
(011), excess cement slurry (012), and mud, cuttings, and cement at the seafloor (013). 
No free oil: Region 10 has determined that no free oil shall be discharged. The no free oil limitation is Region 10's
best professional judgement determination of BPT controls for these discharges. Compliance with the free oil limitation
for miscellaneous discharges will be by visual observation for a sheen on the receiving water, except for bilge water
under the conditions described below. All of these discharges have been subject to this limitation in the previous
permits issued by Region 10 and past practices have not resulted in violations of this limit. 


G. Discharge 014 (Test Fluids) 


Limited volumes of formation waters which are encountered during testing of the well are authorized for discharge
as test fluids. Formation waters are encountered during well testing and are similar in composition to produced waters.



Free oil: 

As previously discussed, no discharge of free oil is permitted from discharges authorized by this permit. In previous
general permits, Region 10 has determined that the BCT effluent limitations guideline of no discharge of free oil
from the discharge of deck drainage, drilling muds, drill cuttings, and well treatment fluids should apply to other
discharges, including test fluids. The no free oil limitation is Region 10's best professional judgement determination
of BCT controls for the test fluids discharge. Operators have been subject to a no free oil limitation in previous permits
issued by Region 10, and past practices have not resulted in violations of this limitation. In accordance with Section
308, the Static Sheen Test will be required for the monitoring of test fluids. 


Oil and grease: 

Although oil and grease is a conventional pollutant subject to BCT, it also serves as BAT (i.e., as an indicator of toxic
pollutants) for produced water. Specifically, the toxic pollutants which are controlled by limiting oil and grease
include phenol, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, and toluene (U.S. EPA 1993a). EPA has determined that it is not technically
feasible to control these toxic pollutants individually so that the limitation on oil and grease controls discharge
these pollutants in produced water at the BAT level (U.S. EPA 1993a). 
The promulgated BAT for oil and grease in produced water as 29 mg/l monthly average and 42 mg/l daily maximum based upon
the improved operating performance of gas flotation technology (58 FR 12506, March 4, 1993). Based upon the chemical
similarity of test fluids and produced water, Region 10 Agency has determined that it is reasonable to apply the produced
water provisions to test fluids. Accordingly, the proposed permit limits on oil and grease in test fluids are 29 mg/l
monthly average and 42 mg/l daily maximum. 


pH: 

The pH of discharged test fluids (which may have a substantially different pH from that of the ambient receiving water)
has been limited to a range of 6.5-8.5 at the point of discharge. In Region 10's best professional judgement,
this limitation appropriately equals a BPT level of control. No more stringent standard has been identified by the
Region at this time. Therefore, Region 10 is setting a BCT effluent limitation for the pH of test fluids equal to that
of BPT. This limitation will ensure that pH changes greater than 0.2 pH unit will not occur beyond the edge of the 100-meter
mixing zone [40 CFR  125.121(c)]. This requirement has been and is routinely complied with by operations under
previous BPT permits and thus, reflects no cost incremental to BPT.

H. Other Discharge Limitations 




No Floating Solids, or Visible Foam, or Oily Wastes:

 Region 10 has determined that the BCT effluent limitations guideline of no discharge of floating solids from the discharge
of sanitary wastes should apply to all other discharges as well. Operators have been subject to a visible foam limit
and an oily waste limit in previous permits issued by Region 10 and past practices have not resulted in violations.



Surfactants, Dispersants, and Detergents:

 The draft permit contains a provision that the discharge of surfactants, dispersants, and detergents shall be minimized
except as necessary to comply with the safety requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration
and the Minerals Management Service. These products contain primarily nonconventional pollutants. This provision
previously appeared in the permits for the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Norton Sound, Bering Sea, and Cook Inlet. 


Rubbish, Trash, or Other Refuse:

 The discharge of any solid material not authorized by this permit (as described above) is prohibited. This permit
includes limitations set forth by the U.S. Coast Guard in 33 CFR part 151 for domestic waste disposal from all fixed
or floating offshore platforms and associated vessels engaged in exploration of seabed mineral resources. These
limitations, as specified by Congress apply to all navigable waters of the United States. 
This permit prohibits the discharge of ``garbage'' including food wastes, within 12 nautical miles from nearest
land. Comminuted food waste (able to pass through a screen with a mesh size larger than 25 mm, approximately 1 inch)
may be discharged from operations located 12 nautical miles or more from land. Graywater, drainage from dishwater,
shower, laundry, bath and washbasins are not considered ``garbage'' within the meaning of the Coast Guard regulations.
Incineration ash and non-plastic clinkers that can pass through a 25 mm mesh screen may be discharged greater than
3 miles from the nearest land; otherwise, ash and non-plastic clinkers can only be discharged beyond 12 nautical miles
from nearest land. 


Other Toxic and Non-conventional Compounds:

 Under the proposed permit, prohibitions on discharges of the following pollutants are retained: halogenated phenol
compounds, trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium chromate, and sodium dichromate. The class of halogenated
phenol compounds includes toxic pollutants, and sodium chromate and sodium dichromate contain chromium, also a
toxic pollutant. Trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid is a nonconventional pollutant. The discharge of these compounds
was previously prohibited in the general permits for the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Norton Sound, Bering Sea, and
Cook Inlet.

I. Best Management Practice Plan Requirement 


It is national policy that, whenever feasible, pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source, that pollution
which cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner, and that disposal or release into
the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner
(Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13101). Section 402(a)(1) authorizes EPA to include miscellaneous
requirements in permits on a case-by-case basis which are deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act.
Best Management Practices (BMPs), in addition to numerical effluent limitations, are required to control or abate
the discharge of pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(k). 
Pursuant to Section 402(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and Region 10 policy (EPA Region 10, 1992), development and implementation
of a Best Management Practices Plan is included as a condition of this NPDES general permit. 
The proposed general permit requires the development and implementation of a BMP Plan which prevents or minimizes
the generation of pollutants, their release, and/or potential release from the facility to the waters of the United
States through normal operations and ancillary activities. Relevant operations and activities include material
storage areas, site runoff, storm water, in-plant transfer, process and material handling areas, loading or unloading
operations, spillage or leaks, sludge and waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. 
In addition to developing and implementing the BMP Plan, the operator is also required to certify that the BMP Plan
is complete, on-site, and available upon request (see Part II.F.1. of the permit). Certification is required no later
than submission of their written notice of intent to commence discharge (see Part I.C. of the permit). These certification
requirements are similar to the requirements for a mud plan. 
The BMP Plan must be amended whenever there is a change in the facility or in the operation of the facility which materially
increases the potential for an increased discharge of pollutants. The BMP Plan will become an enforceable condition
of the permit; a violation of the BMP Plan is a violation of the permit. 


VI. Other Legal Requirements 


A. Oil Spill Requirements 


Section 311 of the Act prohibits the discharge of oil and hazardous materials in harmful quantities. Routine discharges
specifically controlled by the permit are excluded from the provisions of Section 311. However, this permit does
not preclude the institution of legal action or relieve permittees from any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties
for other, unauthorized discharges of oil and hazardous materials which are covered by Section 311 of the Act. 


B. Endangered Species Act 


The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allocates authority to and administers requirements upon Federal agencies regarding
endangered species of fish, wildlife, or plants and habitat of such species that have been designated as critical.
Its implementing regulations (50 CFR Part 402) require EPA to ensure, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior
or Commerce, that any action authorized, funded or carried out by EPA is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat. [40 CFR 122.49(c)]. 
In compliance with Section 7 of the ESA, an endangered species list was requested by EPA and received from both the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the affected area. The following
threatened, endangered and/or candidate species are reported to potentially occur in the vicinity of the discharges
associated with oil and gas operations proposed by the permit: arctic peregrine falcon, spectacled eider, stellars
eider, and bowhead whale. 
A draft biological evaluation was prepared by Tetra Tech under contract to EPA to determine whether the discharges
authorized by this proposed general permit are likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species or
its critical habitat (Tetra Tech, 1994b). Based upon the available information, it is not expected that the exploratory
oil and gas permitted discharges and related activities will not adversely affect any of the listed species or their
habitat. 
EPA has informally consulted with the USFWS and the NMFS pursuant to Section 7 consultation of the Endangered Species
Act. The EPA shared the draft biological evaluation with USFWS at their request. Comments raised by the USFWS have
been addressed. EPA has forwarded the revised document to both Services for their review. EPA will consider the Services'
comments in developing the final permit. 


C. Coastal Zone Management Act 


EPA has determined that the activities authorized by this general permit are consistent with local and state Coastal
Management Plans. The proposed permit and consistency determination will be submitted to the State of Alaska for
state interagency review at the time of public notice. The requirements for State Coastal Zone Management Review
and approval must be satisfied before the general permit may be issued. 


D. Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act 


No marine sanctuaries as designated by this Act exist in the vicinity of the permit areas.

E. State Water Quality Standards and State Certification 



Since state waters are involved in the proposed general permit area, the provisions of Section 401 of the Act apply.
In accordance with 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1), public notice of the draft permit has been provided to the State of Alaska agencies
having jurisdiction over fish, shellfish, and wildlife resources (see section II.C. above). 


F. Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12866
pursuant to Section 8(b) of that order. 


G. Paperwork Reduction Act 


EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in this draft general permit under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501 

et seq. 

Most of the information collection requirements have already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) in submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the
environmental monitoring requirements pursuant to Section 403(c) of the Clean Water Act in Part II.B.4 of this permit
are similar to the monitoring requirements that were approved by OMB for the previously issued Beaufort Sea II and
Chukchi Sea general permits (September 28, 1988, 53 FR 37846) and the modification of the Beaufort Sea II NPDES general
permit (September 27, 1989, 54 FR 39574). The final general permit will explain how the information collection requirements
respond to any OMB or public comments. 



H. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 



After review of the facts presented in the notice of intent printed above, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions
of 5 USC 605(b), that this general permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
This certification is based on the fact that the regulated parties have greater than 500 employees and are not classified
as small businesses under the Small Business Administration regulations established at 49 FR 5024 

et seq. 

(February 9, 1984). These facilities are classified as Major Group 13_Oil and Gas Extraction SIC 1311 Crude Petroleum
and Natural Gas.

Grants For Violence-Related Injury Prevention Research; Notice of Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1995 


Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces applications are being accepted for Violence-Related
Injury Prevention Research Grants for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving
the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce
morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the area of Violent and Abusive
Behavior (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the Section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

) 



Authority 



This program is authorized under Sections 301, 391-394 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241, 280b-280b-3).
Program regulations are set forth in Title 42 CFR Part 52. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants include all non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus State, and local health departments,
other State and local governmental agencies, universities, colleges, research institutions, and other public
and private organizations, including small, minority and/or woman-owned businesses are eligible for these research
grants. Current holders of CDC injury control research projects are eligible to apply. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1.0 million may be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 3 to 5 grants. The amount of funding actually
available may vary and is subject to change. New grant awards will not exceed $300,000 per year (including both direct
and indirect costs). Grant applications that exceed the $300,000 per year cap will be returned to the investigator
as non-responsive. Research grant supplements will generally be no more than $75,000 (including both direct and
indirect costs). New awards are expected to begin on or about September 1, 1995. Awards will be made for a 12-month budget
period within a project period not to exceed 3 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on
the basis of satisfactory progress demonstrated by investigators at work-in-progress monitoring workshops, the
achievement of workplan milestones reflected in the continuation application, and the availability of Federal
funds. In addition, continuation awards will be eligible for increased funding to offset inflationary costs depending
upon the availability of funds. 



Purpose 



The purposes of this program are to: 

A. Build the scientific base for the prevention of injuries and deaths due to violence in the following three priority
areas: interpersonal youth violence, youth suicide, and firearm injuries as delineated in Injury Control in the
1990s: A National Plan for Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993 and Healthy People 2000;


B. Identify effective strategies to prevent violence-related injuries; 

C. Expand the development and evaluation of current and new intervention methods and strategies for the primary prevention
of violence-related injuries; 

D. Encourage professionals from a wide spectrum of disciplines such as medicine, health care, public health, criminal
justice, and behavioral and social sciences, to undertake research to prevent and control injuries from interpersonal
violence and suicidal behavior.

Program Requirements 



The following are applicant requirements: 

A. A principal investigator who has conducted research, published the findings, and has specific authority and responsibility
to carry out the proposed project. 

B. Demonstrated experience in conducting, evaluating, and publishing injury control research on the applicant's
project team. 

C. Effective and well-defined working relationships within the performing organization and with outside entities
which will ensure implementation of the proposed activities. 

D. An explanation of how research findings could lead to the development of injury control interventions within 3-5
years of project start-up. Furthermore, how the research findings might be disseminated and implemented through
organizations (such as public health agencies) or systems, both public and private. 

E. The ability to carry out injury control research projects. 

F. The overall match between the applicant's proposed theme and research objectives, and the program priorities
as described under the heading ``Programmatic Interests'' and in Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for
Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993, and Healthy People 2000.






Note: 

Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care services. 





Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements (as set forth in the PHS Grants Policy
Statement) as necessary to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application. 



Programmatic Interests 



The grants should concentrate on the need to prevent the morbidity, mortality, and disability which results from
interpersonal violence and suicidal behavior, in order to reduce their devastating social and economic impact on
the nation. Applicants are encouraged to propose research which either: (1) Rigorously evaluates the outcomes of
violence prevention strategies currently in use, or (2) identifies modifiable risk factors which can lead to the
development of effective interventions. Examples of possible projects listed under the priority areas below are
by no means exhaustive, and innovative approaches are encouraged. Because of time constraints, comments were not
solicited from the general public regarding funding priorities and special considerations. 

(1) 

Evaluating the outcomes of violence prevention strategies: 

In prevention,

 there is specific interest in research which evaluates the effectiveness of interventions in preventing violent
injuries or reducing their impact and develops the basic sciences of injury (i.e., social and behavioral science,
biomechanics, and epidemiology). This research might evaluate one or more different approaches to implementing
a specific intervention strategy. In addition, there is a need to examine intervention strategies for which evidence
of effectiveness is either sparse or totally lacking. Interventions chosen for evaluation should have a significant
potential for reduction in violent injury morbidity, mortality, disability, or cost. Special consideration will
be given to grants which target populations at high risk for violence-related injuries and their consequences, including
adolescents, women, and children, racial and ethnic minorities, urban residents, and people with low incomes. 

Prevention strategies for 

youth suicide

 whose effectiveness should be assessed include: 

 school or community ``gatekeeper'' training; 
 screening for high-risk youth; 
 peer support programs; 
 suicide education of the general population; 
 crisis centers and hotlines; 
 limiting access to lethal means of suicide, such as firearms, prescription drugs, and high places; 
 intervention after a suicide or attempted suicide to prevent imitation due to the effects of ``contagion''.

<TEXT>
 

Interventions which should be evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing firearm injuries are listed below:

 firearm design modifications to reduce the lethality of firearms and ammunition, loading indicators, and
safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge; 
 statutory interventions (e.g., prohibiting carrying firearms in public, increasing sentences for felony
gun use, or owner liability for firearm injury); 
 imposing waiting periods and limits on the number of guns which can be purchased within a specified time period;

 taxing firearm and/or ammunition purchases; 
 increased gun dealer fees and restrictions; 
 metal detectors in schools; 
 firearm licensure system (e.g., restricting youth access to firearms, owner-registration regulations,
etc.); 
 storage containers which limit unauthorized access to weapons and ammunition; 
 disrupting illegal gun markets through localized street-level tactics currently used against illegal drug
markets, and neighborhood-oriented police coordination with residents and community-based organizations; 
 public education campaigns to change weapon storage practices. 

Examples of interpersonal youth violence interventions which deserve further evaluation include: 
 mentoring programs which provide positive adult role models for high-risk youth; 
 public information campaigns which dramatize the unacceptability and enormous social and economic cost
of 
violence, while promoting alternatives to violence as a means of conflict resolution; 
 environmental changes such as improved lighting, protective landscaping, or closed-circuit television
monitoring; 
 legal sanctions restricting youth access to alcohol; 
 job training and work experiences; 
 sports and recreational activities which offer young people opportunities to spend time in a structured and
purposeful environment; 
 parent training to increase parental support for non-violent behavior by youths. 
(2) 

Identifying modifiable risk factors: 
In epidemiology, 

there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks of injury which
might lead to new or more effective interventions against the four types of violence highlighted in this announcement.
Examples of 

potentially modifiable risk factors 

which should be examined for each area are listed below: 


Youth Suicide 

 impact of acute exposure to alcohol and chronic alcohol abuse on suicidal behavior among youth; 
 possible relationship between sexual orientation and suicidal behavior among youth; 
 impact of accessibility to lethal means (e.g., guns, medications) upon youth suicide; 
 relationship between a history of physical and/or sexual abuse and suicidal behavior among youth; 

Firearm Injuries 
 risk of firearm injury vs. the protective value of firearms; 

 motives and sources of gun acquisition by adolescents; 

 role of firearms in protecting people from injuries; 

Interpersonal Youth Violence 
 role of social and economic factors (e.g., unemployment, poverty, family dysfunction, and racism) in contributing
to violent behavior; 
 early childhood experiences of violence, as a victim or witness, related to later development of violent behavior
patterns; 
 link between television and media portrayals of violence and the development of attitudes which lead to violent
behavior as an acceptable method of settling conflict; 
 influence of alcohol or other drug use upon victimization and perpetration of violent behavior;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00035 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 role of academic performance, athletics or other extracurricular activities as a protective factor for violent
behavior; 
 history of prior victimization as a predictor of risk for future homicide/assault perpetration or victimization.


Also of interest is research that more accurately defines the cost of violent injuries and the cost effectiveness
or prevention effectiveness of interventions. Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate,
to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses one of the three priority areas of violence-related injury research
previously outlined, (i.e., youth suicide, firearm injuries, and interpersonal youth violence). A more complete
discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in, A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness
of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number
RR-3, pages 5-11). (To receive information on these reports see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 


Evaluation Criteria 




Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading, Program Requirements (A-F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive
will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive
may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient
technical and scientific merit to warrant further review (triage); the CDC will withdraw from further consideration
applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and
the official signing for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further
evaluated by a dual review process. Awards will be made based on priority score ranking by the Injury Research Grants
Review Committee (IRGRC), programmatic priorities and needs by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and
Control, and the availability of funds. 

A. The first review will be a peer review to be conducted on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:


1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad long-term objectives, the intended accomplishment
of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested;

and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill; 
3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed
research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research; 
4. For competitive renewal and supplemental applications, the progress made during the prior project period. For
new applications, (optional) the progress of preliminary studies pertinent to the application; 
5. The adequacy of the proposed research design, approaches, and methodology to carry out the research, including
quality assurance procedures, plan for data management, and statistical analysis plan; 
6. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of the
stated objectives; 
7. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities; 
8. The degree of commitment and cooperation of other interested parties (as evidenced by letters detailing the nature
and extent of the involvement); 
9. The reasonableness of the proposed budget to the proposed research and demonstration program; 
10. Adequacy of existing and proposed facilities and 
resources. 
B. The second review will be conducted by the Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control. The factors to
be considered will include:

rural); 
5. Budgetary considerations (e.g., preference may be given to applicants who submit proposals requesting funding
for research projects of one to two year's duration); 
6. Additional consideration may be given to those applicants who provide evidence of an active training program or
mentoring program for inexperienced minority injury researchers (``junior investigators''). 
C. Continued Funding:

Continuation awards made after FY 1995, but within the project period, will be made on the basis of the availability
of funds and the following criteria: 

1. The accomplishments reflected in the progress report of the continuation application indicate that the applicant
is meeting previously stated objectives or milestones contained in the project's annual workplan and satisfactory
progress has been demonstrated through monitoring presentations or work-in-progress workshops; 

2. The objectives for the new budget period are realistic, specific, and measurable; 

3. The methods described will clearly lead to achievement of these objectives; 
4. The evaluation plan will allow management to monitor whether the methods are effective; and 
5. The budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable and consistent with the intended use
of grant funds. 
D. Supplementary Funding:

ACTION:

 Notice of public workshop.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public scientific workshop to discuss draft guidance for manufacturers
concerning testing requirements for alternatives to breast prostheses containing silicone.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA recognizes that many women needing or wanting breast implants would like to have a safe and effective alternative
to breast prostheses containing silicone. In addition, potential manufacturers of these medical devices would
like to know the agency's views on testing requirements for alternative breast implants intended for reconstruction
and/or augmentation. The purpose of the scientific workshop is to provide a forum for FDA to present draft guidance
concerning alternative breast prostheses testing requirements. Among the major topics planned for discussion
are developments in biomaterials, chemical characterization of materials, mechanical testing, preclinical biological
testing, clinical testing, quality of life considerations, requirements for investigational device exemptions
and premarket approval applications, and postmarket-epidemiological issues. The workshop will include discussion
and an exchange of information by invited scientific authorities.

<DOCTITLE>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health; Privacy Act of 1974; Altered System of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of an altered system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing a notice of altered
system of records for the attached 67 Privacy Act systems of records. The purpose of the alteration is to add a new routine
use.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

PHS is proposing to add a new routine use to the 67 Privacy Act systems of records listed below. This routine use will
permit the disclosure of information from these systems to certain individuals who are working in various PHS components
but who do not have the status of agency employees and, in many instances, do not receive pay from the office that employs
them. Examples of such categories of individuals are:




PHS volunteers engaged under 42 U.S.C. 217b.

Student volunteers engaged under 5 U.S.C. 3511.

Job Corps enrollees engaged under the Job Training Older American Community Service Employment Act enrollees. 

Individuals working under a personal services contract.




Since some offices that use these workers wish to have them perform functions that entail access to records in Privacy
Act systems of records, the question arose whether these workers can be considered employees for purposes of the Privacy
Act. PHS has decided to promulgate a new routine use rather than rely on the protection of subsection (b)(1) of the Privacy
Act.

The proposed new routine use is compatible with the purpose of the data collection, since the disclosures are being
made for the very purpose for which the information was collected, i.e., to carry out the particular agency or program
function for which the specific system of records was established.

The records will continue to be adequately protected, since the individuals to whom the information will be disclosed
work under the supervision of agency employees. They must observe the same safeguards that agency employees do in
the maintenance of Privacy Act records.

Single Family Property Disposition Sales Program for 
Public Safety Employees 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal 
Housing Commissioner, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today, HUD is announcing a sales initiative under the 
Single Family Property Disposition Regulations that is designed to enhance the quality of life and make more homeownership
opportunities available to employees who are charged with the responsibility of ensuring the safety and well-being
of residents in the community. Under this effort, HUD will allow governmental entities to purchase HUD-owned properties
for resale to their public safety employees, such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians.
These properties will be occupied by the public safety employees as their primary residences. Assisting local governments
by making properties available for purchase by public safety employees will further the Department's objective
of creating a safe and decent housing environment for all American families. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 291, Disposition of HUD-Acquired Single Family Property, allow the Secretary to
sell properties to governmental entities. 
On October 20, 1993, the Department published an interim rule, which subsequently became effective on November 19,
1993, amending certain provisions of part 291 to allow for a greater flexibility in fluctuating market situations
and to provide greater opportunities for affordable housing to families and to State and local governments or nonprofit
organizations serving low- and moderate-income families. 
A major goal of the Department is to use its resources in a manner that enhances the general well-being of American communities.
Promoting safe neighborhoods is a critical component of the Nation's housing policy. 
The Department wants to assist these kinds of efforts. Accordingly, it will utilize its authority under 24 CFR part
291 to make single family properties nationwide available for this purpose. 


II. Requirements for Purchase of Properties 


Only a unit of state or local government may purchase properties under this program. Governmental entities will receive
a discount of 30 percent for those properties which are uninsurable and located in revitalization areas. Insurable
properties in revitalization areas will be offered at a discount of 10 percent. It is anticipated that this discount
will be passed on to the public safety employee. 
Governmental entities purchasing properties under this program should establish a means to ensure that its intent
is not abused by the potential purchaser, the public safety employee. The public safety employee should be required
to occupy the property as his or her principal residence for at least one year from the date of HUD's closing. Exceptions
may be granted by the governmental entity to this occupancy requirement. 


III. Participation in this Program 


Properties will be sold to governmental entities through competitive bidding or direct sale. Interested governmental
entities should contact the local HUD Field Office in their jurisdiction for information on this program.

Notice of document availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery
plan for 

Aristida chasae, Vernonia proctorii, Lyonia truncata 

var. 

proctorii. 

These three species are endemic to Puerto Rico and known only from the southwestern part of the island. The species
are threatened by agricultural, residential and tourist development. The Service solicits review and comments
from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened species or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish them,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.



Aristida chasae, Vernonia proctorii 

and 

Lyonia truncata 

var. 

proctorii 

are known only from the southwestern part of the island of Puerto Rico. 

A. chasae, 

an endemic grass, is known from two areas: The Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge in Cabo Rojo and the Sierra Bermeja
hills in Cabo Rojo and Lajas, 

V. proctorii and L. truncata 

var. 

proctorii, 

two small shrubs, are known only from upper slopes of the Sierra Bermeja hills. All three species are threatened in
these hills by residential, agricultural and tourist development. Wildfires, a frequent occurrence in the dry southwest
scrub forests, also threatened these species, particularly in the Sierra Bermeja. 

A. chasae 

may also be threatened by competition from introduced grass species.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531.

AGENCY: 

Lower Gila Resource Area, Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

The Draft Maricopa Complex Wilderness Management Plan and Environmental Assessment is available for public review
and comment. Two open public meetings will be held to facilitate and record public comment. Written comments will
also be accepted through November 2, 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

(1) Scope of Proposed Action and Alternatives: The draft plan covers the management of four Wilderness Areas: the
Sierra Estrella, the North Maricopa Mountains, South Maricopa Mountains and the Table Top for a period of ten years.
The environmental assessment document describes the impacts of the proposed action and three alternatives.


(2) Geographic Areas Involved: Four separate wilderness areas, totaling 173,000 acres in the Lower Sonoran Desert
of Southwestern Arizona, southern Maricopa and western Pinal Counties, within a 45 mile radius of Gila Bend, Arizona
and 12 to 45 miles south of the metropolitan Phoenix. Other towns in the vicinity are Maricopa, Stanfield, Casa Grande,
Avondale and Buckeye, Arizona.

(3) Summary of Proposed Actions: Seventy nine miles of former vehicle ways reclaimed; 16 miles converted to pedestrian
and/or equestrian trails. Four access routes shortened. Seventeen vehicle barriers constructed. Four new trails
and seven trailheads established and two existing trails and trailheads improved and maintained. Signs, enlarged
parking areas, and minimal camping facilities provided at some trailheads. Two vehicle safety shoulders created
along Interstate 8. Trail and human encounter standards adopted, maps and other information provided. Commercial
recreation outfitters and guides permitted. Six wildlife water catchments and associated fencing modified, and
along with two others, maintained. One new pump installed in a wildlife water well. Transplants of desert bighorn
sheep and aircraft telemetry following allowed. Installation of new wildlife catchments to be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis. Animal damage control allowed. Five earthen livestock water tanks abandoned. Thirteen livestock control
fences maintained. Coordination with multi-jurisdictional law enforcement and search and rescue agencies and
organizations improved. Five thousand seven hundred and sixty acres of State of Arizona surface and subsurface inholdings
acquired plus some access easements. New grazing standards established. All wildfire suppressed but related activities
restricted. Reduction in low-level civilian aircraft flights encouraged. Twenty nine instances of motorized/mechanized
use allowed annually over 9 years dropping to 18 per year thereafter, to: maintain 8 livestock fences, modify 6 wildlife
catchments, maintain and haul water to these and two other catchments, respond to life-threatening emergencies,
rescue sick livestock, pursue felons or major game violators, and census or track wildlife. Response actions if monitoring
standards are exceeded are identified.

(4) Proposed Restrictions: No campfires, charcoal fires, wood gathering or wood cutting, and other surface disturbances.
Pets prohibited on one trail; horses on another. No camping within 200 feet or sight of the established trails, five
day camping limit of stay at trailheads. Some pack stock activity restrictions.

(5) Summary of Alternatives: A visitor use and wildlife enhancement alternative with additional hiking and/or riding
trails and wildlife developments; a naturalness enhancement alternative without maintained trails, with most
developments removed, and 10 instances of low level aircraft use occurring yearly for wildlife census; and a no action
alternative maintaining the status quo.

(6) Kind and Extent of Public Involvement Provided: Two open public meetings will be held to record comments on the
draft proposals. These will be held in Gila Bend and Phoenix, Arizona at the following times and locations:

<USDEPT>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Union Pacific Railroad Company_Abandonment_in Morgan County, CO (Julesburg Subdivision)


The Commission has issued a certificate authorizing Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) to abandon its line of railroad
known as the Julesburg Subdivision, extending from milepost 81.10 near Union to the end of the line at milepost 98.78
near Ft. Morgan, a distance of approximately 17.68 miles in Morgan County, CO. The abandonment was granted subject
to: (1) The condition that UP keep intact all of the right-of-way underlying the track, including bridges, trestles,
culverts, and tunnels, and retain the line intact and not sell any portion thereof, for a period of 180 days from the
effective date of this decision to enable any State or local government agency or other interested person to negotiate
the acquisition of the right-of-way for public use; (2) the condition that UP retain its interest in and take no steps
to alter the historic integrity of line in its entirety (except for rails, ties, and related appurtenances, which
may be salvaged) until completion of the section 106 process of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
470f; (3) the condition that UP, prior to conducting any salvage operations, contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Omaha District, to determine if permits are required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344; and (4)
the employee protective conditions in 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979).
The abandonment certificate will become effective October 20, 1994, unless the Commission finds that: (1) A financially
responsible person has offered financial assistance (through subsidy or purchase) to enable the rail service to
be continued; and (2) it is likely that the assistance would fully compensate the railroad.
Any financial assistance offer must be filed with the Commission and UP no later than 10 days after publication of this
Notice. The following notation shall be typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the envelope containing
the offer: ``Office of Proceedings, AB-OFA.'' Any offer previously made must be remade within this 10-day period.
Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C.
10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27.



Decided: September 14, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company_Joint Relocation Project Exemption_In
Kansas</DOCTITLE>


On August 19, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to
relocate a line of railroad in a joint project with the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company (SKOL). The joint
project involves: (1) A haulage agreement under which SKOL will haul MP cars over its trackage, as MP's agent, between
Winfield and Coffeyville, KS; 
 (2) overhead trackage rights to MP over SKOL rail lines known as: (a) The Moline Subdivision from milepost 248.1 near
Winfield to milepost 127.7 near Chanute; (b) the Tulsa Subdivision from milepost 127.7 near Chanute to milepost 155.8
near Cherryvale; and (c) the Coffeyville Subdivision from milepost 155.8 (also milepost 0.0) near Cherryvale to
milepost 16.9 near Coffeyville,
 a total distance of approximately 165.4 miles; and (3) an abandonment by MP of its Wichita Branch from milepost 387.00
near Yates Center to milepost 453.20 near El Dorado, in Woodson, Greenwood and Butler Counties, KS, a distance of approximately
66.20 miles.
 The transaction was expected to be consummated on or after August 26, 1994.






The joint relocation project will result in an alternate route with no disruption of rail service for MP's customers.
 As indicated, SKOL will haul MP's cars over its lines between Winfield and Coffeyville, KS, pursuant to a haulage agreement.
MP, in turn, will retain access to its customers via the trackage rights granted by SKOL. According to MP, the relocation
of its operations will not generate new traffic, extend rail service into new territory, or impact or change the competitive
situation of the rail carriers in the area. The project is expected to result in satisfactory and cost-effective rail
operations in the area, as well as effective use of rail assets.




The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment component of a relocation project, and require separate
approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion
into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. 

See, generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN, 

4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions
such as the one involved here. 

See D.T.& I.R._Trackage Rights, 

363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental trackage rights component requires no separate
approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies
for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5).
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 

360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Joseph D. Anthofer, Missouri
Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, Nebraska 68179.



Decided: September 13, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of established 1994 aggregate production quota.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice establishes a 1994 aggregate production quota for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine, a substance
in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate
production quotas for all controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to  0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994).



On July 19, 1994, a notice of the proposed 1994 aggregate production quota for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine,
a Schedule I controlled substance, was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 36784). All interested persons were invited to comment on or object to this proposed aggregate production quota
on or before August 18, 1994. No comments or objections were received.

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by  0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 aggregate production quota for the following controlled substance, expressed in grams of anhydrous
base, be established as follows:

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Florida Power Corp.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License No. DPR-72, issued to Florida Power Corporation, (the licensee),
for operation of the Crystal River Unit 3 Nuclear Generating Plant, located in Citrus County, Florida.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action:



The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated June 7, 1993, as supplemented March 28,
1994, for exemption from certain requirements of Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50 (10 CFR 50), Appendix
R, ``Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior to January 1, 1979,'' Section III. 0, ``Oil
collection system for reactor coolant pump.'' The exemption would allow installation of a new reactor coolant pump
motor with an oil collection system which is capable of collecting oil leakage from all potential pressurized and
unpressurized leakage sites except for four potential oil leakage sites. The four potential leakage sites are: the
anti-reverse device (ARD) vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system
piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells.



The Need for the Proposed Action:



10 CFR 50, Appendix A, ``General Design Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants,'' Criterion 3, ``Fire protection,'' specifies
that ``Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed and located to minimize, consistent
with other safety requirements, the probability and effect of fires and explosions.'' 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, sets
forth fire protection features required to satisfy the general design Criterion 3 of the Commission's regulations.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, the RCP shall be equipped with an oil collection system which ``* * *
shall be capable of collecting lube oil from all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor
coolant pump lube oil systems.''

As part of its design improvements program to enhance motor reliability and simplify maintenance activities, the
licensee proposed to replace the existing RCP motors with a new motor and implement, a re-designed RCP lube oil system.
As a result of physical interferences and other design difficulties, four specific sites in the RCP motor lube oil
system could not accommodate an oil collection system for collecting potential oil leakage. An exemption from 10
CFR 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, is required to permit the four specific sites in the RCP lube oil systems without
an oil collection system, and thus, exclude them from leakage protection.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application.

Section III. 0 of Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50 states that: ``The oil collection system shall be so designed, engineered,
and installed that failure will not lead to fire during normal or design basis accident conditions and that there is
reasonable assurance that the system will withstand the Safe Shutdown Earthquake [SSE]. Such collection systems
shall be capable of collecting lube oil from all potential pressurized and unpressurized leakage sites in the reactor
coolant pump lube oil systems. Leakage shall be collected and drained to a vented closed container that can hold the
entire lube oil system inventory.''

The RCP motor lube oil system, with its pumps and associated piping, supplies oil to several parts of the RCP. The existing
RCP lube oil system includes a high pressure and an induced flow system. The high pressure system consists of two independent
pumps, and associated piping, and supplies oil, among other components, to the ARD. The induced flow system is driven
by the rotation of the RCP motor and provides lube oil to the thrust bearings, guide bearings, and to the ARD.

The new oil lubricating system would contain approximately 200 gallons of oil and would include several design features
such as spray shields, series of drip and drain pans and piping, and a lube oil collection system tank. The new system
eliminated one of the two lift pumps and its components which should result in a decrease in the number of potential
leakage sites. The oil collection system would be capable of collecting lube oil from all possible pressurized and
unpressurized leak sites except for the four specific locations. Of the four potential leakage sites, ARD vents and
lower RCP motor leak detection system piping do not contain oil under routine operating conditions. The upper oil
supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD are pressurized only during a brief period of motor startups and shutdowns.
The lower guide bearing thermocouple wells are passive in nature. Additionally, in the new design, vents would be
equipped with demisters and filters to prevent lube oil mist from escaping to the atmosphere. If leakage were to occur
during normal plant operations, the oil would channel to the drain pan. Any lube oil leak which may not have been fully
captured could potentially run down the RCP motor onto hot Reactor Coolant System surfaces. However, the flammability
characteristics of the oil, flashpoint of 452 
 F, and an auto ignition temperature of 500 
 F - 7 
 F, that would be used in the lube oil system, reduce the likelihood that the oil will readily ignite upon coming
in contact with hot RCS piping surfaces. Additionally, if the oil leak became ignited, the fire would be localized
in the area of the leakage and detected by the thermal fire detectors.

Fire protection features for the RCP motors include three temperature heat detectors with 190 
 F setpoints located over each RCP. Any localized fire in the area due to oil leakage would be detected by the thermal
fire detectors and would provide an alarm function in both the reactor building and annunciate in the main control
room. Additional indications of a potential RCP fire would also be provided by control room alarms on low level oil,
low oil pressure or high vibrations. If an RCP fire alarm is received in the main control room, it is expected that the
control room operators would evaluate any alarm associated with the RCP and its lube oil system and initiate fire brigade
entry into the reactor building to investigate and fight the fire. The reactor building is equipped with an internal
firefighting standpipe hose station system and fire extinguishers are appropriately distributed throughout the
structure. RCP firefighting would be accomplished by using either portable fire extinguishers or water from a hose
stream or a combination of both. Access to the four RCPs for firefighting can be accomplished by making entry into the
``D'' rings.

The existing Crystal River Unit 3 RCP motor lube oil system is a non-seismic system. The new RCP lube oil system and lube
oil collection systems would be seismically qualified to withstand an SSE. Therefore, if an SSE were to occur, the
system is not expected to fail.

Based on the design features of the new RCP motors and the fact that their lube oil system and associated lube oil collection
systems are seismically designed to withstand an SSE, there is reasonable assurance that the RCP lube oil system will
not present a major fire hazard.

The staff concludes, based on its evaluation, that potential oil leakage from the specific four sites in the RCP lube
oil system will not present a major fire hazard and that the current level of fire protection is sufficient to mitigate
the consequences of a fire in the area of these potential leakage sites. In addition, the staff concludes that it is
not expected that these potential leakage sites will fail during an SSE. On that basis, the staff finds that the licensee's
proposed design of the RCP motor lube oil collection system provides an equivalent level of fire safety to that required
by the provisions of Appendix R, section III.0, and, therefore, is acceptable.

Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed change does not affect non-radiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement,
dated May 1973, related to operation of Crystal River Unit 3.




Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the State of Florida regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact




The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated June 7, 1993, and March 28, 1994,
which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC and at the local public document room located at Coastal Region Library, 8619 W. Crystal Street, Crystal River,
Florida 32629.

<DOCTITLE>Staff Meetings Open to the Public; Final Policy Statement </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final policy statement. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This statement presents the policy that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will follow in opening meetings
between the NRC staff and one or more outside persons to public observation. This policy statement also announces
central agency services available to the public for obtaining schedules for the staff meetings that are open to public
attendance. Implementing guidance will be issued to the NRC staff as a management directive. The policy statement
relates only to meetings involving the NRC staff and does not affect existing regulations that apply to public attendance
at meetings such as Commission meetings, advisory committee meetings, and enforcement conferences. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background




The NRC first published its policy for open staff meetings in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1978 (43 FR 28058). On September 14, 1993 (58 FR 48080), the NRC published for public comment a proposed policy
statement entitled ``Staff Meetings Open to the Public'' in the 

Federal Register

 that would supersede the policy statement of 1978 (58 FR 48080). The NRC requested comments on the proposed policy
statement and on comments submitted previously by the American Mining Congress that were made in response to an interim
NRC policy statement similar to the policy statement that was proposed. 



II. Summary of Public Comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and NRC Responses 



General Comments 



In late 1993, the NRC received 13 letters with comments on the proposed policy statement on ``Staff Meetings Open to
the Public.'' These comments were from the following organizations: the American Mining Congress; two law firms,
Winston & Strawn and Newman & Holtzinger, P.C.; and seven utilities, including Texas Electric, Yankee Atomic
Electric Company, Commonwealth Edison Company, Florida Power Corporation, Georgia Power Company, Virginia Electric
and Power Company, and Southern Nuclear Operating Company; the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, the State
of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, and Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.
(OCRE). Two of these commenters, Georgia Power Company and Virginia Electric and Power Company, endorsed the comments
of the Nuclear Management and Resources Council. 

Two commenters endorsed the proposed policy statement. The other commenters either objected to the proposed policy
statement or expressed their preference for retaining the 1978 policy statement. Several endorsed the general concept
of opening staff meetings. Most offered suggestions for improving the proposed policy statement should it be adopted
by the Commission. 



Impact on the Quality of Public Meetings 



The principal concern expressed was that having the public present during meetings with the NRC staff would have an
adverse impact on the quality of those meetings. Several commenters indicated that the presence of the public at meetings
with the NRC staff would unnecessarily complicate NRC and licensee discussions, would adversely affect the candor
of those discussions (because the public would likely misunderstand and misconstrue the content of conversations),
and would generally have an adverse effect on open communications between the NRC and licensees. 

The NRC has been conducting public meetings for nearly 15 years under the 1978 policy statement. Since September 1992,
the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, the Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the regional
offices have operated under an interim policy similar to the proposed policy statement. The NRC has not found that
meetings open to the public under the 1978 policy statement or under the 1992 Interim Policy Statement have substantially
interfered with the NRC staff's ability to accomplish its meeting goals or that the presence of public observers adversely
affected its ability to communicate openly with licensees and other participants. Even though the NRC recognizes
that having meetings open to public observation exposes the participants to the risk that information may be misunderstood
or misconstrued, the NRC has not, in its many years of public meetings, found that risk to be of sufficient concern to
outweigh the public confidence gained in the NRC's regulatory programs that comes from public observation of NRC
staff meetings with outside persons. 



Policy Expansion 



Several commenters viewed the presumption that all staff meetings are open for public observation unless they fall
into one of the exemptions detailed in the proposed policy statement as representing a significant extension of the
agency policy on open staff meetings over that published in the 1978 policy statement. They also argue that the extension
adds little to existing opportunities for public participation.

The NRC agrees that the proposed policy statement would result in more meetings being open to the public than would
have been under the 1978 policy statement. The 1978 policy covered only meetings between the NRC and parties to proceedings.
The proposed policy statement reflects NRC's longstanding practice of providing the public with the fullest information
practicable on its activities and of conducting business in an open manner. Evolving agency practice since 1978 has
resulted in additional types of meetings being open to the public that are not covered by the 1978 policy statement.
These include meetings with licensees on technical issues, with licensee senior management on Systematic Assessment
of Licensee Performance reports, and with licensees on exit meetings for special team inspections or by accident
investigation and diagnostic evaluation teams. In addition, NRC has open meetings with trade organizations and
with public interest groups regarding policy and technical issues and the agency's regulatory responsibilities.
The policy statement codifies current practice by establishing uniform guidelines for the staff. 



Definition of a Public Meeting 



Several commenters offered suggestions for refining the definition of ``public meeting.'' Several commenters
suggested that the type of individuals attending a meeting should be a determinant of whether the meeting is open to
the public. One commenter suggested limiting public meetings to those where a decision-maker was attending. Other
commenters suggested limiting public meetings only to those where technical staff were in attendance or where only
a project manager and one or more license representatives were present. The NRC strongly believes that the subject
matter of the meeting, or the administrative burden of opening the meeting, rather than the type of participant in
attendance, should be the determining criterion for deciding if a meeting should be considered open for public observation.


One commenter expressed concern that the policy does not apply to state and local governments, including agreement
states. The policy statement does apply to those entities as provided for in Section C.1. of the policy statement.


A commenter suggested language be included to establish a presumption that meetings between the NRC staff and outside
parties be open. The NRC believes its policy statement clearly announces a policy of openness and establishes only
a limited number of necessary exemptions. The NRC believes the policy statement provides meaningful opportunities
for the public to be informed of NRC activities without unduly affecting open and candid discussions between licensees
and the NRC staff or interfering with the NRC staff's ability to exercise its regulatory and safety responsibilities
without undue administrative burden. 

Other commenters suggested that the definition of a public meeting specifically exclude all meetings other than
``face to face meetings,'' that is, exclude meetings using electronic communications, such as telephone conference
calls or teleconferencing. The NRC agrees that the definition of a public meeting is not intended to include conversations
using electronic communications and has modified the definition to clarify that meetings covered by this policy
statement are those where participants are physically present at a single meeting site. 

One commenter suggested that the definition of a public meeting be limited to one in which public interest has been
expressed or where the NRC has reason to believe there is substantial public interest. The use of this type of criterion
would require that the NRC judge what is of significant interest to a wide range of groups that have varied interests.
The NRC does not presume to judge for these varied groups what meetings they may consider to be of significant interest.
The NRC believes that it is the responsibility of members of the public, not the NRC, to decide if they are interested
in attending a staff meeting. 

Several commenters suggested that the public's role at open staff meetings be clearly limited to that of observers.
The preamble of the proposed policy statement clearly states that staff meetings open to the public would be open only
to observation. However, in response to this concern, the NRC has amended the definition of a public meeting to include
the phrase, ``open to public observation.'' 

Several commenters suggested that the policy statement include specific ways to limit public participation, such
as permitting members of the public to ask questions only at the conclusion of a meeting or requiring them to submit
written comments or questions. The policy statement is not intended to address the role of the public beyond that of
observation. However, the NRC recognizes that some meetings open under the policy statement may warrant a greater
degree of public participation. If participation beyond that of observation is allowed for a particular meeting,
a description of the degree of participation will be specified when the meeting is announced and at the outset of the
meeting by the senior NRC official participating in the meeting. 

One commenter asked that NRC prohibit members of the public from interrupting meetings to pursue a personal agenda
or raise public policy issues. The NRC recognizes the concern outside persons may have regarding this possibility.
As above, the NRC staff will indicate the ground rules for a public meeting at the beginning of a meeting and adhere to
those rules throughout the meeting.

The suggestion that the term ``encounter'' in the definition of a public meeting be changed to ``meeting'' was rejected.
Had this suggestion been accepted, the definition would have read, ``A public meeting is a formal meeting,* * *''
phrasing that does not comply with the logical terms of a definition. 


Exemptions 


In reviewing the comments regarding the exemptions and scope of the policy statement, the NRC staff recognizes that
exemption ``g'' should be clarified. The phrase, ``Is a general information exchange'' has been added to the exemption.
Furthermore, guidance has been provided to the staff at the end of Section C.2 as follows: ``Also note that meetings
between staff and licensees or trade groups to discuss technical issues or licensee performance would normally be
open because they may lead to a specific regulatory decision or action. However, should a meeting involving a general
information exchange be closed and should discussions during such a meeting approach issues that might lead to a specific
regulatory decision or action, the NRC staff may advise the meeting attendees that such matters cannot be discussed
in a closed meeting and propose discussing the issues in a future open meeting.'' 
Several commenters suggested that the policy statement contain additional specific exemptions for closing a meeting.
For example, one commenter suggested closing meetings that are administrative in nature, that are held to discuss
scheduling or constraints associated with licensee actions, or that are held to review material submitted to the
NRC by licensees. The NRC believes that these types of meetings will be exempt to the extent the definition of a public
meeting encompasses only meetings where substantive issues are discussed. Also, exemption ``g'' as rewritten covers
those types of meetings because they are held only for the exchange of information. 
Several commenters suggested closing meetings for the exchange of preliminary, unverified information; meetings
held within a licensee's protected areas; and meetings between NRC Resident Inspectors and licensees. The NRC believes
that these types of meetings are already exempted by the policy statement in that the first type would be closed under
exemption ``f,'' and second and third types would be closed under exemption ``h.'' 
One commenter suggested that exemptions ``f,'' ``g,'' and ``h'' need to be refined to preserve NRC's flexibility
to carry out its health and safety responsibilities without being unduly inhibited by the expanded openness policy.
Another commenter believed these exemptions were too broad. NRC believes exemption ``f'' is sufficiently focused
to be clearly interpreted. Exemptions ``g'' and ``h'' have been refined and the NRC believes that the policy statement
has sufficient flexibility to ensure that NRC meets its safety and regulatory responsibilities. The policy statement
clearly enunciates this flexibility in stating, ``[t]his policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed
from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate.'' The commenter specifically requested that the term ``substantially''
be deleted from exemption ``h.'' The NRC agrees because the NRC will not open a meeting if the NRC staff believes the
administrative burden will interfere with the efficient performance of its safety and regulatory responsibilities
and exemption ``h'' has been broadened to specifically exclude meetings held as an integral part of an NRC inspection.

One commenter interpreted the provision in exemption ``f'' in the policy statement as a means to exempt meetings convened
to solve potential problems, such as reclamation proposals or enforcement matters. The NRC does not agree with this
interpretation. The exemption addresses meetings that could result in the inappropriate disclosure and dissemination
of ``preliminary, unverified information.'' The purpose of this exemption is not to close all meetings for which
preliminary information, proposals, or concerns are discussed, but to specifically ensure that agency licensees
and applicants will not be inhibited in bringing preliminary, unverified information to the attention of the NRC.

The NRC staff believes that this reasoning applies to another commenter who believes that meetings between the staff
and licensees, where technical issues or approaches to emerging issues are discussed, should also be classified
as ``preliminary'' in nature and not open to the public. 


Meeting Arrangements 


Several commenters raised issues regarding arrangements for public meetings. One recommended that public recording
and transcription of meetings be prohibited. The NRC does not believe it should limit public attendees when they want
to record or transcribe proceedings which they have a right to attend. This type of a prohibition would be difficult
to enforce and would infringe upon an established practice of media representatives and others who routinely record
public proceedings for their convenience and subsequent use.

One commenter suggested that ``outside parties'' be consulted before announcing a meeting open to public observation
because they may wish to submit proprietary, personal, or other confidential information prior to the meeting. Another
suggested that the NRC staff inform the ``outside parties'' if a meeting will be a public meeting. This is the current
NRC practice; however, the NRC will include a provision in its implementing management directive emphasizing that
the NRC staff should make outside persons aware when a meeting will be a public meeting. This practice will allow the
outside persons to raise concerns regarding confidential information before a meeting. 
Several commenters expressed the concern that essential or urgent meetings would not be scheduled promptly enough
because of the need to provide ``ten days advanced notice.'' This provision is intended to ensure that when the NRC
staff deems that a meeting should be a public meeting there is sufficient time to provide adequate public notice of
the meeting. When a meeting is deemed essential and adequate public notice cannot be provided, exemption ``h'' of
the policy statement would apply because trying to provide notice would constitute an administrative burden that
could interfere with the NRC staff's efficient execution of its safety and regulatory responsibilities; however,
limited notice would still be provided using available telephone and electronic bulletin board systems. 
Another commenter noted that its experience has been that some past public meetings noticed in the 

Federal Register

 were published on the day of the meeting or published so close to the date of the meeting that public attendance was impossible.
The NRC recognizes that delays may occur because of the requirement to publish a notice of the meeting in the 

Federal Register

. Consequently, the NRC did not adopt publication in the 

Federal Register

 as the principal mechanism for announcing public staff meetings. The NRC will announce public meetings through a
toll-free telephone recording, a toll-free electronic bulletin board, weekly distribution of public meeting announcements
to the Press, and by posting meeting announcements in the NRC Public Document Room. 
One commenter suggested that minutes of closed meetings be prepared when substantive regulatory issues are raised
in a closed meeting or when minutes of the closed meeting can be prepared and released to the public. The NRC recognizes
that closed meetings may involve discussions regarding substantive regulatory matters, such as those involving
preliminary, unverified information; meetings may also be closed because of the administrative burden of opening
the meeting for public observation. The NRC does not believe it is necessary to require in the policy statement the
preparation of meeting minutes or summaries of closed meetings. However, current NRC practice, when appropriate,
is to make publicly available summaries of non-public meetings. This practice will continue.

Duration of Policy 


One commenter suggested that any revised policy adopted by the NRC be limited to a two-year trial basis similar to that
approved for open enforcement conferences. Another commenter suggested that the policy statement should be limited
to a period necessary to determine if there is sufficient interest to justify the expense of opening routine meetings
to the public. The NRC believes that its long-term experience with open meetings justifies opening staff meetings
and that this practice has resulted in significant benefits to the public. Thus the NRC does not believe its policy
should be limited for any particular period of time. 


Costs 


Several commenters expressed concern regarding expenditures that would be required by the NRC and licensees to accommodate
public observation of meetings. Two commenters expressed concern that additional expenditures would be incurred
without commensurate benefits; for example, that public meetings may be held with no public attendance. Should this
happen, these commenters suggested that these types of meetings be added as exemptions because no public interest
in them would have been demonstrated. Others believed that the proposal should be abandoned because it would affect
fee assessments under the agency's 100-percent user fee policy, resulting in a net loss in regulatory effectiveness
and with no public benefit. The NRC does not envision more than a nominal increase in expenditures because the meetings
in question will be held with or without public attendance, and are usually held at NRC facilities and meetings at licensee
facilities are normally held in a facility readily accessible to the public. NRC's costs associated with operating
the toll-free telephone line and the public-access electronic bulletin board are minimal and, to a great extent,
offset by consolidating several current meeting notice telephone systems into one. Press notices of public meetings
will be included in the agency's Weekly Press Release Compilation. Concerns related to fee assessments are routinely
addressed as part of rulemakings for 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171. In February 1994, the NRC issued the ``Report to the Congress
on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Licensee Policy Review Required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992'' that
addresses concerns raised regarding the NRC licensee fee policy. 


American Mining Congress Comments 


The NRC invited public comment on concerns that had been submitted by the American Mining Congress (AMC) on the September
1992, Interim Policy Guidance that had been used by the NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, the Office for Analysis
and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the NRC regional offices. The AMC stated that the proposed policy was generally
responsive to its concerns. AMC's additional comments and the concerns of other commenters who referenced AMC's
concerns are addressed in the preceding analysis of comments in Section II of this document.

III. Discussion of the Policy 


The purpose of revising the open meeting policy is to further the goal of providing meaningful opportunities for the
public to be informed of NRC activities without unduly affecting open and candid discussions between licensees and
the NRC staff or interfering with the NRC staff's ability to exercise its regulatory and safety responsibilities
without undue administrative burden. The policy also provides guidance to the NRC staff concerning the types of meetings
that should be open to public observation. The open meeting policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed
from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate. 
The open meeting policy excludes meetings where the expressed intent is not to discuss substantive issues that are
directly associated with NRC's regulatory and safety responsibilities. Meetings that would not need to be open could
include training, conferences, and association meetings where both NRC staff and applicant/licensee officials
participate. The open meeting policy also excludes meetings or interviews between NRC staff and licensee staff or
management personnel that occur during the performance of an NRC inspection. The policy also excludes meetings the
NRC staff has with its own employees, contractors, and consultants, other Federal agencies where the matter does
not relate to a specific activity for which NRC has oversight, and with representatives of foreign governments and
State and local representatives on matters other than those relating to specific NRC licensing or regulatory actions
involving individual NRC licensees. 
Exemptions to the policy will permit meetings to be closed to ensure that classified, commercial or financial proprietary,
safeguards, personal privacy, and investigative information protected by statute or otherwise requiring protection
is not disclosed to the public. Other exemptions are provided to ensure that the NRC staff has sufficient flexibility
to efficiently carry out its responsibilities. 
A meeting to discuss preliminary, unverified information is not an open meeting under the policy. The purpose of this
exemption is to ensure that licensees and applicants are not inhibited in bringing to the Commission information
that is not verified or sufficiently analyzed to draw firm conclusions. It also ensures that discussions about potential
implications of this type of information occur candidly and openly without fear that it may be misunderstood by the
public as fact or as final conclusions. 
A meeting that is an information exchange having no direct, substantive connection to a specific NRC decision or action
is not an open meeting under this policy. The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that routine administrative matters
relating to regulatory activities can be carried out efficiently. For example, drop-in visits or similar management
meetings between senior executives of a utility licensed to operate a nuclear power plant and the Executive Director
for Operations, Regional Administrators, or other senior NRC managers are generally closed meetings because they
typically consist of a general exchange of information not directly related to any regulatory action or decision.
Furthermore, meetings to discuss schedules for NRC actions, or the status of an applicant's or licensee's activities
would not be open under this exemption. Meetings between staff and licensees or trade groups to discuss technical
issues or licensee performance would normally be open under this provision because they may lead to specific regulatory
action. 
The final exemption is for meetings where the administrative burden associated with public attendance could interfere
with the NRC staff's efficient execution of its safety and regulatory responsibilities. This exemption ensures
that the NRC staff has the discretion to have a needed meeting on short notice where adequate public notice cannot be
provided without placing an undue burden on the agency. The meeting could be necessary because of an urgent issue that
needs addressing or where the opportunity becomes available on short notice to meet with an official of the applicant
or licensee that would benefit the NRC staff person in carrying out his or her duties. The meeting also might be in a location
that does not have the facilities to easily accommodate the public, such as within a plant's protected area, because
these meetings would require an undue administrative burden to establish access authorization for members of the
public. For example, an NRC manager may visit a facility on short notice or without any notice for purposes other than
meeting with licensee officials. These purposes may include but are not limited to monitoring and assessing the performance
of NRC subordinates, touring the facility, or independently assessing licensee performance. During such a trip,
he or she may visit licensee officials and may discuss substantive regulatory issues with them. Opening such a meeting
to the public would constitute an undue administrative burden and could impede the efficient executions of the NRC's
safety and regulatory responsibilities. 
The public meeting notice system planned for providing public notice of all NRC staff meetings open to the public will
have a toll-free telephone recording and a public-access electronic bulletin board for announcing meeting notice
information. Open staff meetings will also be announced by a weekly press release as well as being posted in the agency's
Public Document Room, as is the current practice. 


IV. Commission Policy Statement on Staff Meetings Open to the Public 


A. Purpose 


This statement presents the policy that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff will follow in opening meetings
between the NRC staff and one or more outside persons to public observation. The policy continues NRC's longstanding
practice of providing the public with the fullest information practicable on its activities and of conducting business
in an open manner, while balancing the need for the NRC staff to exercise its regulatory and safety responsibilities
without undue administrative burden. This policy also announces central agency services available to the public
for obtaining schedules for the staff meetings that are open to public attendance. Implementing guidance will be
issued to the NRC staff as a management directive. This meeting policy is a matter of NRC discretion and may be departed
from as NRC convenience and necessity may dictate. 


B. Definition 


A public meeting is a planned, formal encounter open to public observation between one or more NRC staff members and
one or more outside persons physically present at a single meeting site, with the expressed intent of discussing substantive
issues that are directly associated with the NRC's regulatory and safety responsibilities. 
An outside person is any individual who is not:


a. An NRC employee; 
b. Under contract to the NRC; 
c. Acting in an official capacity as a consultant to the NRC; 
d. Acting in an official capacity as a representative of an agency of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch
of the U.S. Government (except when the agency is subject to NRC regulatory oversight);

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940920-2-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940920-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

e. Acting in an official capacity as a representative of a foreign government; 
f. Acting in an official capacity as a representative of a State or local government (except when specific NRC licensing
or regulatory matters are discussed). 


C. Applicability and Exemptions 


1. This policy applies solely to NRC staff-sponsored and conducted meetings and not to meetings conducted by outside
entities that NRC staff members might attend and participate in. It does not apply to the Commission or offices that
report directly to the Commission. Similarly, it does not apply to meetings between the NRC staff and representatives
of State governments, including Agreement State representatives, relating to NRC Agreement State activities or
to State regulatory actions or to other matters of general interest to the State or to the Commission, that is, matters
other than specific NRC licensing or regulatory actions involving specific licensees. Also, the policy is not intended
to apply to or supersede any existing law, rule, or regulation that addresses public attendance at a specific type
of meeting. For example, 10 CFR Part 7 specifically addresses public attendance at advisory committee meetings;
and 10 CFR Part 9, Subpart C, addresses public attendance at Commission meetings. The policy also does not negate existing
Memoranda of Understanding, procedural agreements, or other formal agreements or requirements regarding the accessibility
of the public to observe or participate in meetings between NRC and its licensees or any other entities. In addition,
the policy does not apply to meetings involving enforcement matters under 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C nor to settlement
conferences. 
2. In general, meetings between the NRC staff and outside persons will be classified as public meetings unless the
NRC staff determines that the subject matter to be discussed_
a. Is specifically authorized by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign
policy (classified information) or specifically exempted from public disclosure by statute; 
b. Contains trade secrets and commercial or financial information (proprietary information); 
c. Contains safeguards information; 
d. Is of a personal nature where such disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

e. Is related to a planned, ongoing, or completed investigation and/or contains information compiled for law enforcement
purposes; 
f. Could result in the inappropriate disclosure and dissemination of preliminary, unverified information; 
g. Is a general information exchange having no direct, substantive connection to a specific NRC regulatory decision
or action; 
h. Indicates that the administrative burden associated with public attendance at the meeting could result in interfering
with the NRC staff's execution of its safety and regulatory responsibilities, such as when the meeting is an integral
part of the execution of the NRC inspection program. 
It is important to note that whether or not a meeting should be open for public attendance is dependent primarily on
the subject matter to be discussed, not who outside nor who within the NRC staff is participating (e.g., staff level
versus senior management). 
Also note that meetings between staff and licensees or trade groups to discuss technical issues or licensee performance
would normally be open because they may lead to a specific regulatory decision or action. However, should a meeting
involving a general information exchange be closed and should discussions during such a meeting approach issues
that might lead to a specific regulatory decision or action, the NRC staff may advise the meeting attendees that such
matters cannot be discussed in a closed meeting and propose discussing the issues in a future open meeting. 


D. Notice to the Public 


1. Normally, meeting announcement information is to be provided by the staff to the agency's meeting announcement
coordinator at least ten days in advance of the date of the meeting so that adequate notice can be made to the public.
Public notice will be provided through the Weekly Compilation of Press Releases and posting in the NRC headquarter's
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street (Lower Level) NW., Washington, DC. The public may obtain a schedule of agency staff
meetings on a toll-free telephone recording at 800-952-9674 and on a toll-free electronic bulletin board
at 800-952-9676. 
2. Meetings which are scheduled for the next 60 calendar days will be announced to the public. Meeting announcements
will include the date, time, and location of the meeting, as well as its purpose, the agency and outside organizations
in attendance, and the name and telephone number of the agency contact for the meeting. Information about canceled,
rescheduled, and open meetings scheduled on short notice will be updated daily or as needed by its posting at the agency
Public Document Room, on the telephone recording, and on the electronic bulletin board.

Self-Regulatory Organization; the Depository Trust Company; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Establishing
the Stock Loan Income-Tracking System


On May 6, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') submitted a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-07)
to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on June 22, 1994, to solicit comment from interest persons.
 This order approves the proposal.





I. Description of the Proposal


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish the stock loan income-tracking system that will eliminate
the need for participants to track income distributions on their securities that are the subject of outstanding stock
loans. The current DTC procedures enable participants to identify stock loan related deliver orders through the
use of reason codes. Proper allocation of income payments arising from the securities that are the subject of these
loans currently rests entirely with the lending and borrowing participants because DTC allocates income to participants
to whom the securities are credited on the relevant entitlement date (

i.e.

, the borrowing participants). Lending participants recover income that DTC has allocated to borrowing participants
either through DTC's securities payment order service or through some other mutually agreed upon arrangement by
the participants.
The proposed rule change will facilitate participants' processing of income attributable to securities that are
the subject of outstanding stock loans. The proposed stock loan income-tracking system will track and monitor participants'
stock loan related deliver orders; will net the share amounts by participant and CUSIP; and will automatically credit
income distributions to the proper participant on income payment date. To execute these functions, DTC will create
a special stock loan memo account which will maintain a daily net balance of loan obligations for each stock loan counterparty
of each participant. 
The proposed rule change provides that a party from whom distributions are due to be transferred may unilaterally
halt all future distribution transfers by giving a letter of instructions to DTC two or more business days in advance
and by giving a copy to the counterparty. DTC will notify the counterparty participant of any action taken by DTC based
on the instructions. DTC will not assess the parties legal obligations to each other.
 




If a participant's account is being transferred to another participant due to a merger or acquisition, DTC will move
the transferring participant's open stock loan positions to the transferee participant. 
If a participant is about to retire, DTC first will verify that the participant has closed out all its entitlements
and obligations for future distributions created by stock loans. If DTC has ceased acting on behalf of a participant,
DTC will determine which other DTC participants are stock loan counterparties and will adjust those participants'
stock loan memo account positions in order to balance the elimination of DTC's obligations to and entitlements from
the terminated participant. 
Before the stock loan income-tracking system is implemented, DTC will provide a means for participants to load DTC's
stock loan data base with information about currently outstanding stock loans. Deliveries with a stock loan reason
code made after implementation will automatically be added to this data base. 


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular Section 17A of the Act.
 Sections 17A (b)(3)(A) and (F) of the Act
 require that each clearing agency be organized and its rules be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the
custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. Moreover, in Section 17A(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, Congress set forth its findings that new data processing and communication techniques create the opportunity
for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearing and settlement.







The stock loan income tracking system is an automated system which will eliminate inefficient income processing
by stock loan counterparties. Because DTC receives data related to stock loan income attributions in the normal course
of its operations, DTC is in a good position to process such data and to maintain appropriate records of the rights and
obligations of its participants to the income related to stock loan activity. In addition to being well situated for
the centralized processing function, because DTC processes all data through its automated facilities, there should
be uniform treatment of the data as opposed to the current system whereby stock loans income attributions are handled
differently by each involved DTC participants. The Commission believes that the stock loan income tracking system
should improve the efficiency of the income transfer and record keeping. 
Additional, the stock loan income tracking system is being implemented consistently with DTC's obligation to safeguard
securities and funds in its custody or control. In addition to DTC normal safety measures, DTC has built into the system
risk reduction measures such as provisions for the termination of future DTC obligations upon a participant's voluntary
or involuntary termination of its membership. 


III. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that DTC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act.







It is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-07) be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to New
Organizational Structures for Members</DOCTITLE>


September 13, 1994.


I. Introduction


On February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend the Exchange's Constitution and rules to allow the admission of entities with new organizational
structures as members.





The proposed rule change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34390 (July 15, 1994), 59 FR
37278 (July 21, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change.


II. Description of the Proposal



The NYSE is amending NYSE Rule 311(f) to permit entities with new organizational structures to qualify for admission
to Exchange membership. Specifically, the NYSE is amending its rules to permit the Exchange to approve as a member
organization, entities that have characteristics essentially similar to corporations, partnerships, or both.
For example, the amendment permits the Exchange, it its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange
may prescribe, to approve business trusts,
 limited liability companies
 or other organizational structures as member organizations so long as the characteristics of the entity in question
are essentially similar to those of corporations or partnerships. Currently, memberships on the Exchange can be
owned by individuals, partnerships, and corporations. The noncorporate or partnership entities
 

would have to be structured in such a format that would qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC pursuant
to the Act, as this is a prerequisite to becoming an Exchange member organization.







The Exchange believes that the rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(2) of the Act
 in that it permits registered brokers or dealers to become member organizations of the Exchange. The Exchange also
believes that the rule change also is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
 in that it broadens the types of entities which the Exchange may approve as a member organization and therefore avoids
possible unfair discrimination, and with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,
 in that it serves to remove possible burdens on competition resulting from organizational structure not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.







III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 Specifically, the Commission believes the amendment is consistent with Section 6(b)(2)
 of the Act, which requires the rules of an exchange, subject to the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Act,
 to ensure that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may
become a member of the exchange and any person may become associated with a member thereof.







The NYSE currently allows individuals, partnerships, and corporations to become members of the Exchange.
 The amendment would enable entities with new organizational structures similar to corporations and partnerships
to become Exchange members and be included in the Exchange's definition of a member organization. As in the case of
a partnership or corporation applying for membership, the new entity will be subject to all other requirements for
membership approval.





The Commission believes that the amendment to NYSE Rule 311(f) reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in having
the flexibility to approve entities with new organizational structures for Exchange membership, with the regulatory
interests in protecting the financial and structural integrity of a member organization. For example, although
the amendment permits the Exchange to approve business trusts, limited liability companies, or other organizational
structures with characteristics of corporations or partnerships as member organizations, the NYSE will review
each Exchange member organization application on a case-by-case basis, and prior to approving any such organization
for membership, the Exchange must be satisfied that: (1) The Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction
over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member
organizations.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-01) is hereby approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Sulphur Carriers, Inc.; Notice of Application for Permission Pursuant to Section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act,
1936, as amended, and Article II-13 of Waterman Steamship Corporation's Operating-Differential Subsidy
Agreement, Contract MA/MSB-450 for Operation of the M/V SULPHUR ENTERPRISE in the Coastwise Trade of the United
States


Notice is hereby given that Sulphur Carriers, Inc. (SCI), a U.S. corporate affiliate of Waterman Steamship Corporation
(Waterman), by letter dated September 15, 1994, requested written permission pursuant to section 805(a) of the Act
and Waterman's Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement (ODSA), Contract MA/MSB-450, to operate the U.S.-flag
M/V SULPHUR ENTERPRISE (Vessel), for and on behalf of Freeport-McMoran Resource Partners (Freeport)_a principle
phosphate fertilizer producer in the United States_in the coastwise trade of the United States. The requested permission
is to amend a previously approved section 805 permission for the M/V NORDIC LOUISIANA.
On September 27, 1991, the Maritime Administrator granted written permission, pursuant to section 805(a) of the
Act and Waterman's Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement, Contract MA/MSB-450, for operation of the
British-flag M/V/ NORDIC LOUISIANA for and on behalf of Freeport in the coastwise trade of the United States, as authorized
by Public Law 102-100. The permission was for a period of four years, or until a replacement vessels for the M/V
NORDIC LOUISIANA, enters service, whichever is sooner. The replacement vessel M/V SULPHUR ENTERPRISE is expected
to be delivered on or about September 23, 1994.
Because of the short time frame of this notice, one party who expressed an interest previously in this matter will be
contacted directly.
Any person, firm or corporation having any interest (within the meaning of section 805(a)) in SCI's request and desiring
to submit comments concerning the request must by 5:00 PM on September 22, 1994, file written comments in triplicate
with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, together with petition for leave to intervene. The petition shall
state clearly and concisely the grounds of interest, and the alleged facts relied on for relief.
If no petition for leave to intervene is received within the specified time or if it is determined that petitions filed
do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will take such action as
may be deemed appropriate.
In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues are received from parties with standing to be
heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence under section 805(a) relative to whether
the proposed operations (a) could result in unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusively
in the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (b) would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act relative
to domestic trade operations.

<DOCTITLE>Substitute Return Format Standardization for Individual Returns Filed on Paper</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement_Notice of intent to standardize substitute return format for individual returns filed on paper. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The IRS is in the process of modernizing its computer systems and in keeping with this premise, those forms and schedules
that are not filed electronically will be scanned and machine-read. This technology will expedite processing, increase
customer service, and maximize the use of resources. The changes will become effective as the new computer systems
of the IRS become operational and notice will be posted in the Internal Revenue Bulletin and disseminated through
other media. IRS will then request that the following methods be used to file individual income tax returns: 




1. Electronically-filed returns; 
2. Computer-generated summary sheets (Form 1040PC); 
3. IRS-published Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ and their respective forms and schedules (or machine readable substitutes,
as defined in Revenue Procedure 94-51). 




Publication 1167, Substitute Printed, Computer-Prepared, and Computer-Generated Tax Forms and Schedules, has
been revised to reflect these preferences. There are several reasons for this initiative. The IRS receives more than
115 million individual tax returns and the volume increases annually. Form 1040PC and electronic filing provide
better quality input. They also reduce the need for document storage. IRS wishes to limit the submission of traditional
returns to IRS-produced paper forms in keeping with the Tax System Modernization (TSM) initiatives to scan all forms.
However, IRS recognizes that many practitioners and individual taxpayers utilize software packages to produce
computer generated returns and that this software is considered by the public to reduce the burden in the filing of
tax returns. Therefore, IRS seeks a balance between its need to maintain strict control and the convenience the taxpaying
public enjoys through the use of tax preparation software. The goal is to scan all returns received. IRS will hold a
``Town Meeting'' to discuss this intent with the public. 






Note: 

Last minute changes to the date or location of the meeting are possible and could prevent advance notice.

Reauthorization of Vocational and Adult Education Programs 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for public comment on the reauthorization of vocational and adult education programs. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education invites written comments from the public regarding the reauthorization of programs under
the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; the Adult Education Act; and the National Literacy
Act of 1991.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Secretary is requesting public comments on the reauthorization of the Department's Vocational and Adult Education
programs, including 18 programs funded at approximately $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1994. The funded programs include:
Vocational Education Basic State Grants; Tech-Prep Education; Vocational Education Research; Vocational Education
Demonstrations; Vocational Education Data Systems; Adult Education State Programs; State Literacy Resource Centers;
Literacy Programs for Prisoners; Workplace Literacy Partnerships; and Adult Education National Programs, including
the National Institute for Literacy. 


Need for Reauthorization 



The statutory authorization for these programs expires on September 30, 1995. In order to contribute in a timely manner
to congressional reauthorization discussions, the Secretary is beginning a review of these programs. The Secretary
intends to submit to Congress the Department's proposals to reauthorize these programs in early 1995. To ensure an
opportunity for public participation, the Secretary invites public comments on the reauthorization. 


How the Information Will Be Used 



The Department has identified six general issues, listed as follows, around which to initiate reauthorization discussions
and is particularly interested in receiving comments on those issues. The Department seeks to develop program initiatives
that link vocational and adult education programs to the National Education Goals and to the national effort to enable
all students to achieve to challenging academic standards. As such, the reauthorization will build on the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and the pending Elementary and Secondary Education
Act reauthorization, each of which focuses on_providing students with greater opportunities to meet high standards;
giving States and localities flexibility in the delivery of services in exchange for accountability for results;
and directing Federal resources to communities where they are most needed, in amounts sufficient to make a real difference.
The Department will also examine how Federal Vocational and Adult Education programs can be coordinated with other
Federal programs, such as the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), Higher Education Act student aid programs, and
Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) that address similar purposes and serve similar populations.

The reauthorization process also provides an opportunity for resolution of issues affecting current programs that
have arisen through evaluations, audits, program operations, budget deliberations, and previous legislative
actions. Thus, the Department, while it will examine new program strategies, also seeks comment on the program-specific
issues listed below. 


Issues for Public Comment 


The Secretary seeks comments and suggestions regarding reauthorization of these programs. Comments are especially
invited on the following issues.

General Principles and Issues 


1. Restructuring Vocational and Adult Education Programs To Achieve the National Education Goals




Results of recent studies of vocational and adult education reveal that considerable progress must be made in these
areas if the Department hopes to achieve the National Education Goals. For example, the National Adult Literacy Survey
found that as many as 90 million adults in the United States have serious problems with literacy, and, of those, approximately
40 to 44 million function at the lowest proficiency levels defined by the survey. With the American economy in transition,
increasing global challenges to our economic competitiveness, and more jobs requiring a high level of technical
expertise, our employment and training systems must produce greater numbers of skilled and adaptable workers than
in the past. 

How can the Federal Vocational and Adult Education programs best be structured to help the Nation achieve the National
Education Goals, particularly the goal of ensuring that every American is literate and possesses the knowledge and
skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship? 


2. Promoting World-Class Standards for All Students




A major theme of the Administration's earlier legislative proposals has been creating an expectation for all students
to meet challenging academic or occupational skill standards. The Department is now exploring options for making
this theme a core principle for the Perkins Act and Adult Education reauthorizations as well. Along these lines, how
can these Federal Acts best incorporate systems of standards and implement these standards for all vocational and
adult education students, including in-school and out-of-school youth, postsecondary students, adults, and special
populations? How can these standards best be coordinated with standards developed under Goals 2000 and the reauthorized
Elementary and Secondary Education Act? 



3. Connecting Vocational and Adult Education to Broader Objectives for Achieving Education Reform



How can some of the other key themes of the Administration's earlier proposals_such as offering greater State, local,
and school flexibility in exchange for accountability for student outcomes (including authorizing waivers of certain
statutory and regulatory requirements), encouraging integration of services across categorical programs, and
targeting resources more effectively_be incorporated in the Vocational and Adult Education reauthorization?



4. Linking the Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act


Should some aspects of the Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act be meshed? For example, could the reauthorization
coordinate resources to create a more coherent system for preparing youth and young adults for further education
and employment? 




5. Coordinating With Other Federal Programs and Initiatives



In recent reports, the General Accounting Office identified, by its count, over 150 programs with employment training
aspects, including several vocational and adult education programs. The GAO reports contend that the programs overlap
one another and are poorly coordinated, and that their proliferation makes it difficult for States and localities
to forge comprehensive employment training strategies. In light of these findings, how should Federal Vocational
and Adult education statutes relate to other Federal programs, such as JTPA, Higher Education Act student aid programs,
and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and to pending initiatives such as elementary and secondary
education reform, welfare reform, and the Reemployment Act? How can Perkins Act and Adult Education Act resources
be better deployed to meet national needs for workforce development? 



6. Building Bridges Between Vocational Education, Adult Education, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act


Should the Perkins Act or the Adult Education Act, or both, be revised to complement the School-to-Work Opportunities
Act? If so, how should this be accomplished? What principles and goals would be achieved by this linkage? Should some
or all of Perkins Act resources be structured specifically to support the School-to-Work act? 


Issues That Cut Across Both Vocational and Adult Education Programs

<TEXT>
 

Program Standards and Assessment



Under existing legislation, States have developed systems of standards for the evaluation of both vocational and
adult education. Research suggests that these standards are not widely used for program improvement. How can the
reauthorization encourage the use of program standards and assessment to improve the quality of vocational and adult
education? How can valid program standards, meaningful assessments, and the use of both in program improvement,
be instituted in vocational and adult education at the national, State, and project levels? Is it feasible to develop
national standards for either program or core standards that apply to both programs? 



Distribution of Funds



Both the Adult Education Act and the Perkins Act include funding formulas that specify how the Department of Education
allocates vocational and adult education funds to the States. The adult education formula is based on the number of
adults, 16 years of age and above, who are not required to be in school and have not received a high school diploma or its
equivalent. The vocational education formula, under the 1990 amendments to the Perkins Act, remains essentially
the same as under the original Vocational Education Act of 1963; the two main elements of the formula, a set of population
factors and an income factor, have remained unaltered for over 30 years. Neither formula includes incentives for
States to develop successful, innovative programs or to increase their financial support for vocational or adult
education. 

The Department intends to review the current allocation formulas for vocational and adult education programs and
seeks comment on how those allocation formulas might be changed or how the distribution of funds might otherwise be
improved. For example, what methods of distribution, other than formulas, could be designed? If formulas are retained,
what bases, other than population, years of schooling, and income, might be used to allocate Federal funds? What other
specific changes are desirable? For example, should the adult education formula be modified to reflect the fact that
many clients, particularly those enrolled in English-as-a-Second Language courses, already have earned a high
school diploma or its equivalent? To consider the impact on State allocations of the in-school population count?
Should the vocational education formula include need-related factors such as the State unemployment rate or dropout
rate? In general, should funding allocations to States, under either program, be more targeted? 



Corrections Education



The Adult Education Act, the National Literacy Act, and the Perkins Act contain three separate provisions for providing
educational services to incarcerated individuals. Section 326 of the Adult Education Act requires a State to reserve
at least 10 percent of its adult education allocation to fund education programs for criminal offenders in corrections
institutions and other institutionalized individuals. Literacy Programs for Prisoners, section 601 of the National
Literacy Act, authorizes discretionary grants to establish and operate programs that reduce recidivism through
the improvement of life skills and functional literacy. Under section 102(a)(5) of the Perkins Act, States are required
to set aside at least one percent of their allocations for vocational education programs for juvenile and adult criminal
offenders. 

Are these three separate authorities effective at meeting the vocational and adult education needs of incarcerated
individuals? Would this population be served better if these authorities were combined into a comprehensive education
program for criminal offenders? If so, should there continue to be a set-aside in the Adult Education Act for institutionalized
individuals? If so, should it also address the needs of non-incarcerated criminal offenders, such as parolees and
probationers? 



State Plans and Responsibilities



Are any aspects of the State organizational and planning responsibilities under the Adult Education Act or the Perkins
Act overly burdensome? If so, which provisions of the Acts should be revised or deleted to ease any administrative
burden they cause? To encourage comprehensive State plans, should any of the State organizational or planning responsibilities
under the Acts be modified to require linkages to other Federal education planning requirements, such as those in
Goals 2000, the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act?




Professional Development



Both the Adult Education Act and the Perkins Act include provisions for encouraging educators' professional development,
but a more comprehensive system of Federal support for professional development may be required. Section 353 of the
Adult Education Act requires that at least 15 percent of a State's allocation be reserved for demonstration projects
and teacher training activities; at least two-thirds of this reservation must be used to train adult educators. Under
the Perkins Act, States and local service recipients are authorized to use Basic grants and Tech-Prep funds for professional
development, and the Act also authorizes support for professional development through other, currently unfunded
authorities. Despite these provisions, adult education research has found that few instructors are certified adult
educators_only 18 percent of full-time staff and 8 percent of part-time staff. According to the recent National Assessment
of Vocational Education (NAVE), both secondary and postsecondary vocational teachers have less formal education
than academic teachers, while virtually all academic teachers and faculty members have at a least a bachelor's degree,
12 percent of secondary vocational teachers and 15 percent of postsecondary occupational faculty do not. 

What steps can the Federal Government take through the reauthorization to ensure that vocational and adult educators
possess the knowledge and skills necessary to be effective and teach to high standards? How can resources under the
Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act be used to (1) Support professional development strategies that States will
develop under the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and (2) ensure that educators learn and apply
the principles of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, so that schools accomplish real integration of academic
and vocational skills? 



Data Collection



In the course of collecting data for the National Evaluation of Adult Education Programs, the Department's contractor
found weaknesses in the information management systems of many local programs. Many programs that participated
in the study did not know how many different clients they serve during a year nor the number of students they serve on
a given day. In vocational education, NAVE researchers found data inconsistencies across local tech-prep programs,
and national data collection efforts in vocational education have long been problem-plagued. Yet, data collections
can be extremely important because they can, if properly conducted, yield valuable information on program outcomes
and can help drive funding and policy decisions at both the State and Federal levels. 

What role can the Federal Government play to ensure that data collection activities in vocational and adult education
programs yield meaningful information that can be used to improve programs and, ultimately, benefit the learner?

1. Basic State Grants



 Program Focus. 

The last two reauthorizations of the vocational education basic grant have emphasized program improvement and achieving
equitable access for special populations. Have these emphases produced the desired results of better preparation
for, and success in, postsecondary education and the labor market for the target populations? Should the reauthorization
address a revised or expanded set of objectives? 

 Secondary and Postsecondary Education. 

Should the Perkins Act be restructured to focus on assisting in the comprehensive reform and improvement of secondary
education, for example by providing resources primarily to encourage the integration of academic and vocational
education at the high school level? Alternatively, should the Act focus mainly on the improvement of postsecondary
education, especially community college programs? As a related issue, should the Perkins Act continue to support
vocational education only below the baccalaureate level? What attention should the Act give to the needs of out-of-school
adults and youth, including dropouts? 

 Discretionary Grant Competitions. 

The final NAVE report recommends that Congress consider using some portion of Basic State Grant funds for competitive
grants to States that propose, and show promise of effecting, comprehensive reforms consistent with the goals of
the Act. Should the Department adopt this recommendation? More broadly, should the Act be revised to provide incentives
for States to undertake comprehensive reform of their vocational education programs? How would these incentives
account for the differences in progress States have already made in undertaking reforms? 

 Role of the States. 

Most observers agree that the 1990 amendments to the Perkins Act deemphasized the role of the States, yet the NAVE Independent
Advisory Panel has contended that States hold the key to achieving vocational education reform at ``a pace and scale
sufficient to affect national workforce quality.'' Should the next reauthorization establish a stronger State
role? For what purpose? Should the current State governance structure in the Act be modified to reinforce the State
partnerships developing under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act? How would this be achieved? 

 Targeting Funds for Special Populations. 

The NAVE reports that individuals with special needs are overenrolled, relative to their presence in the population,
in vocational education. Should the Perkins Act continue to target funds to areas with high concentrations of special
populations? Should there be more emphasis on serving all students? 

 Criteria for Services to Special Populations. 

The 1990 Perkins Act amendments greatly increased the amount and specificity of procedural requirements related
to provision of services to special populations. Are these provisions ensuring that members of special populations
receive equal access to program services? Are the services provided of benefit to special populations? Could the
level of prescription be reduced, in exchange for greater attention to higher outcomes for all students, including
students with special needs? Are the current provisions and protections for special populations effective at ensuring
that they have an equal opportunity to enter and succeed in the full range of high-quality vocational programs? Should
the law continue to focus on providing the supplementary and other services that special populations need to succeed
in vocational education, or, as the final NAVE report suggested, should it instead focus more on improvement of the
vocational programs in which those students participate? If that strategy were carried forward, would other programs
such as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
be able to provide the supplementary services special populations require? 

 State Plans. 

The current Perkins Act State planning requirements are some of the most prescriptive found in any Federal education
legislation. Can the goals of these planning requirements be met without these controls on State process? Are the
existing procedures for development of the plan and the items required to be included in the plan having their desired
effect? If not, what changes should the Department consider?

 State Council on Vocational Education. 

For over two decades, the Federal Government has funded the activities of State councils to advise on and assist in
the development of vocational education programs in the States. While the 1992 JTPA amendments allow the States to
consolidate their vocational education councils into broader State Human Resource Investment Councils, most States
have continued to operate separate councils for vocational education.

Have the State vocational education councils fulfilled their objective of monitoring quality and ensuring business
involvement in the operation of programs in the States? Should they continue to be separately funded, or should their
operation be at State discretion? Is maintaining the independence of councils chartered under the Perkins Act important?
Does the existence of separate councils for vocational education contribute to a fragmentation of State policymaking
within the broader areas of human resource development and employment? Should consolidation with the State Human
Resource Councils be required in order to ensure coordination between JTPA and vocational education? 

 Program Accountability.

According to the NAVE, most States have gone beyond the accountability requirements established in the 1990 amendments
to the Perkins Act, developing fuller arrays of performance measures than required and applying them to all vocational
programs, not just those receiving Perkins funds. However, while as of 1991-1992 State agencies had given a
high priority to developing performance standards and measures, local implementation had not yet occurred. Have
States and localities found the standards and measures useful for improving programs? How have States' experiences
implementing these requirements compared to experiences with the accountability requirements under the JTPA?
Should the reauthorization encourage States and localities to give more attention to development and implementation
of performance standards and measures? If so, how can program performance best be evaluated and measured so as to benefit
the grantees, allow for replication of successful projects, and provide meaningful information to the Department
and to Congress? Additionally, should federally supported vocational programs, which currently must meet the accountability
requirements set forth in the Perkins Act, be aligned with the standards-based reform activities States and localities
will undertake under Goals 2000 and the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act?

Even beyond the standards and measures requirements, the 1990 Perkins amendments greatly increased the Act's focus
on accountability, including adding language on ``program improvement'' to ensure that local grantees, and then
States, take action to improve ineffective programs. Is this working? Should it be continued? Should the statute
incorporate more incentives for success? How are the incentives and adjustments for special populations working?
Should the statute allow States to take ``corrective action'' or cut funding to programs that repeatedly fail to reach
the standards? More broadly, how can the reauthorization better emphasize accountability for results? 

 Skill Standards.

Development of occupational and industry skill standards has become an important component of Federal policy. The
Goals 2000: Educate America Act establishes a National Skill Standards Board to encourage the creation of a comprehensive
system of voluntary skill standards and certification. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act includes, as a basic
element of the school-based learning component, high academic and occupational skill standards to be developed
under Goals 2000. Previously, the Departments of Education and Labor funded 22 grants to promote the development
of skill standards and certification in a variety of industries. How could the reauthorization support the development
of voluntary industry skill standards and portable skill certification? How would skill standards and certification
of work-related skills affect educators developing curricula and employers seeking skilled workers? 

 Coherent Sequence of Courses.

The NAVE found that, in general, secondary vocational programs are not as coherent or rigorous as they should be. They
usually lack prerequisites, which maximizes access but reduces chances of aligning vocational courses with each
other or with academic courses. In addition, the NAVE reported that most districts, including Title II grant recipients,
do not meet the Perkins requirement for a coherent sequence of academic and vocational courses. Should the next reauthorization
do more to ensure that more students have the opportunity to take a coherent sequence of academic and vocational courses?
If so, how? 

 All Aspects of the Industry.

The Perkins Act encourages local recipients to use basic State grant funds to provide vocational education programs
that educate students in all aspects of an industry. The NAVE found that, as of the second year of implementation of
the 1990 Perkins amendments, the ``all aspects'' language had only a minor impact on vocational programs. Should
the reauthorization continue this area of statutory emphasis? If so, how can it be made more effective?

 Employer Interest and Involvement.

A 1993 survey conducted for the NAVE asked employers about their familiarity and satisfaction with vocational programs.
About 60 percent of employers responding to the survey (which had a high non-response rate) said they were familiar
with vocational education programs in their local areas. Forty-one percent were familiar with secondary vocational
programs, and 47 percent with postsecondary programs. How should the reauthorization encourage business interest
and involvement in occupational education? Along these lines, should the reauthorization seek to strengthen cooperative
education, and, if so, how? Should employer involvement, through activities such as provision of work-based learning
experiences, be given more prominence in the Act? If so, how can the Act increase business involvement, including
increased workplace education in vocational and basic skills? What about other federally supported programs, including
adult education programs? 

 Sex Equity and Single Parents Programs.

The Perkins Act requires States to set aside 10.5 percent of Basic State Grant funds for programs to eliminate sex bias
in vocational education and programs for single parents, single pregnant women, and displaced homemakers. Have
these provisions worked effectively to eliminate sex bias and provide appropriate opportunities for single parents
and displaced homemakers in vocational education? If not, what changes should be made? Do the two set-asides mesh
with State priorities or are they overly restrictive? Are the two set-asides still needed? 

Current law also requires that each State employ a full-time sex equity coordinator who administers the sex equity
and single parents set-aside programs, collects and disseminates data on programs, provides technical assistance
to local programs, and carries out other responsibilities. Is this requirement an effective means of ensuring gender-equitable
practices in vocational programs? Is it still needed? Is it overly prescriptive? 

 Native American and Hawaiian Natives Programs.

Currently, under Basic State Grants, the Department sets aside funds for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians.
What role should Perkins play in providing vocational education for these populations? Are the current set-aside
programs working effectively, or should they be revised? Would the population served through the program be better
served if the program was administered by the Department of the Interior? Should the education needs of Native American
youth be addressed through current means, or should greater efforts be made to provide resources for these students
as part of more comprehensive systems? If so, how would this work?



2. Tech-Prep Education



Tech-Prep programs have expanded tremendously since their introduction in the mid-1980s. The tech-prep approach
is one of the few models for local school-to-work opportunity programs and can be built on by States as they implement
statewide school-to-work opportunity systems. However, the NAVE found considerable inconsistency in the quality
of these programs and in the extent to which they have incorporated all the program components described in the literature
and the legislation. Should the reauthorized Act continue to provide categorical support for Tech-Prep education,
or should broader support for School-to-Work Opportunities programs, including other models, be offered? If the
Tech-Prep program is continued, how can the Act be amended to improve the quality of local projects? Should the Tech-Prep
Education program include a mandatory work-based learning component?



3. Research and Dissemination



What should the role of the Department be in conducting vocational education research, and how should it be conducted?
Through a national center or centers, as is currently the case for most of the Federal effort? Through field-initiated
research? Through discretionary research projects determined through annual priorities? What should be the role
of the Department in disseminating research results, descriptions of effective practices, and other information
on vocational education? How can vocational education research and dissemination activities, along with similar
activities in other programs and Departments, be structured in order to ensure maximum benefits and the efficient
use of resources?



4. Demonstration Programs



The Vocational Education Demonstrations Program authority provides the Department and educational institutions
an opportunity to try new approaches to vocational education and to learn about the effectiveness of these approaches.
The Department has funded a large number of demonstration projects in a variety of areas. Has the field found these
demonstrations useful in obtaining information on effective educational approaches? Should a Federal vocational
education demonstrations program authority be continued? If so, what areas of inquiry might be emphasized? How should
the demonstration projects conducted under this authority mesh with the newly authorized School-to-Work demonstration
projects and other, related Federal demonstration activities?



5. Vocational Education and Occupational Information Data Systems

Currently, under the Perkins Act, the Departments of Education and Labor provide funding for the National Occupational
Information Coordinating Committee (NOICC) and its affiliated State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees
(SOICCs). The NOICC and the SOICCs assess current and future labor market conditions by assembling and disseminating
occupational information. Is the current system useful to educators planning programs and to students selecting
careers? If not, what changes should be made? How can the NOICC and SOICCs be linked to key elements of the Reemployment
Act, such as One-Stop Career Centers?



6. Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions



Through this program, the Department provides grants for the operation and improvement of tribally controlled postsecondary
vocational institutions. Is the program fulfilling its purposes? Should the program be continued? Would the population
served through the program be better served if the program was administered by the Department of the Interior?



7. Unfunded Authorities



Currently, the Perkins Act includes separate funding authorities for career guidance and counseling programs,
business-labor-education partnerships, vocational education lighthouse schools, model community education
employment centers, supplementary State grants for facilities and equipment, and other program improvement activities.
None of these activities is currently funded. Should any of them be continued in the reauthorization? If so, why, and
with what revisions? More specifically, how should the reauthorization address the area of career development and
counseling?



Adult Education



1. State Programs



 Program Focus.

According to an analysis of 1990 census data, more than 44 million adults, nearly 27 percent of the adult population
of the United States, have not received a high school diploma or its equivalent. The adult education formula targets
this population. Of that population, 39 percent have completed eight or fewer years of education, but 61 percent have
finished between nine and twelve years of schooling. Forty-one percent of the target population is 60 years of age
or older, while 11 percent fall between 16 and 24 years of age. The variation in these individuals' educational needs
and goals can make it difficult and time-consuming for adult educators to design effective instructional strategies
for them. An additional complication is the broad statement of purpose contained in section 311 of the Adult Education
Act, which focuses, in part, on providing assistance to States ``* * * to improve educational opportunities
for adults who lack the level of literacy skills requisite to effective citizenship and productive employment. * * *''

Should Adult Education remain as a separate program serving a diverse population of adult learners with diverse needs?
As one alternative, should the programs be refocused, for example on work preparation and literacy skills upgrading
for adults? How can Federal Adult Education programs best be structured to achieve the current objectives in areas
such as workforce preparation, family literacy, and English proficiency? Should program services be organized
around target populations (such as dislocated workers or immigrants)? By program objective (such as basic skills
or workplace literacy)?

 General Educational Development (GED) Preparation.

Many of the approximately one million adults who enrolled in Adult Secondary Education programs in 1993 had as their
goal the attainment of a GED certificate. The value of the GED examination as a measure of academic competence and achievement
has attracted increasing attention over the past several years as the percentage of high school certificates awarded
through equivalency examinations has increased. In the United States, 475,602 of the 756,645 adults who took the
GED in 1993 passed the test. Studies focusing on the skill levels, economic outcomes, and postsecondary education
experience of GED holders have yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradictory results. For example, most research
on the economic value of the GED shows that it is significantly less valuable than a high school diploma; on the other
hand, some evidence indicates that GED recipients have higher incomes than high school dropouts.

Should attainment of a GED diploma continue to be a primary focus of Adult Secondary Education? If not, what credential
alternatives are available for adults seeking to complete their secondary education? Should local programs be encouraged
to offer courses that allow adults to earn a high school diploma? 

 Set-Asides.

By establishing set-asides and targeting the needs of special populations, the Adult Education Act requires States
to use their Federal adult education funds to address the educational needs of a diverse population, for example:
those in need of basic education services, the limited-English-proficient, incarcerated and otherwise institutionalized
individuals, and public housing residents. While each of these groups may have a well-established need for adult
education services, the mix of their needs may make it difficult for adult education providers to target limited resources
on, and create solutions to, the most pressing problems in adult education.

Do the set-asides (e.g., 10 percent for criminal offenders in corrections education and other institutionalized
individuals) required by the Adult Education Act further the purposes of the Act? Are they overly prescriptive? Should
the reauthorized program continue to draw a distinction between adult basic education and adult secondary education
and specify the maximum amount of funds that may be used for high school equivalency programs? Should the Gateway Grants
program be continued?

 Special Experimental Demonstration Projects and Teacher Training.

For many years States have reserved formula grant funds to undertake special projects and to train adult educators.
Has this set-aside been an effective means of spurring innovation and ensuring a trained adult education workforce,
or should other means of achieving those objectives be considered? If this set-aside is retained, should States be
required to establish mechanisms for the dissemination of effective practices?

 English-as-a-Second Language.

The National Evaluation of Adult Education Programs found that enrollments in English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL)
courses are outpacing enrollments in Adult Basic Education (ABE) and Adult Secondary Education (ASE); during 1992,
approximately 46 percent of all clients served in the Basic State Grants program were enrolled in ESL courses. The
study also found that the characteristics of ESL clients vary considerably from those served in ABE and ASE. For example,
about 50 percent of new ESL clients had a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, while 89 percent of new ABE/ASE
students lacked such a credential.

Given the above findings, is the Adult Education program structured properly to address the English language instruction
needs of limited English proficient individuals? If so, should the funding formula be changed, or should a new formula
be added, to reflect the characteristics of this population?

 Achievement.

Should the Adult Education Act be amended to provide a grea
