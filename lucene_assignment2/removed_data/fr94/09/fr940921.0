Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAC
1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes. This action requires revising the Limitations Section of the
FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation.
This action also provides optional terminating action for the AFM limitation. This amendment is prompted by reports
of cracking of certain brackets and levers in the primary flight control system due to residual stresses, mechanical
loading, and material properties changes associated with aging. The actions specified in this AD are intended to
prevent loss of integrity of the primary flight control system due to structural failure of the brackets or levers.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400
series airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received reports of cracking of certain brackets and levers in the primary
flight control system. These brackets and levers were manufactured from L53 aluminum alloy casting material. Investigation
has revealed that the cracking may be attributed to a combination of residual stresses, mechanical loading, and material
properties changes associated with aging. Cracking of these brackets and levers could lead to structural failure
of these components. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of integrity of the primary flight control
system. 



British Aerospace has issued Alert Service Bulletin 27-A-PM6025, Issue 1, dated March 23, 1994, which
specifies a new operating restriction for reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation. Limiting
/such reversion to emergency situations only will greatly reduce the probability that flight control system brackets
and levers (manufactured from L53 aluminum alloy casting material) will experience higher stresses, and thereby
higher probability of structural failure associated with manual operation of the flight control systems. 

The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking
of the rudder pedal pivot brackets, elevator pivot levers, and aileron pulley brackets (manufactured from L53 aluminum
alloy casting material) in the primary flight control system, replacement of any cracked bracket or lever with a serviceable
part, and application of water displacing fluid to the brackets and levers. The CAA classified this alert service
bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of the integrity of the primary flight
control system. This AD requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)
to limit reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation. This AD also provides for an optional terminating
action for the AFM limitation, consisting of inspections, replacement (as necessary), and application of water
displacing fluid, as specified in the alert service bulletin described previously.

The FAA is considering further rulemaking to require accomplishment of the currently optional terminating action.
However, the proposed compliance time for those actions is sufficiently long so that notice and time for public comment
would not be impracticable. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-138-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the 
autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. This amendment is prompted by 
several incidents in which the flight crew did not depress both halves of the autopilot 
disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 approach and, as a result, one autopilot 
remained engaged. This condition resulted in unanticipated movements of the stabilizer 
trim and higher than anticipated control forces of the flight controls. The actions 
specified by this AD are intended to prevent the flight crew from inadvertently 
disconnecting only one autopilot when both autopilots are engaged, which could result in 
unanticipated control surface movements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 


Federal Register

 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24383). That action proposed to require 
replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost 
approximately $2,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,860, or $2,940 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A Series 
Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe
125-1000A series airplanes, that requires modification of the control circuit wiring for the engine thrust
reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. This amendment is prompted by a report that a single
dormant electrical fault in the control circuit of the thrust reversers could cause a thrust reverser to deploy if
the pilot selects reverse thrust during the approach phase of flight; and by reports that if an asymmetric thrust reverser
condition occurs, the correct rudder bias may not be annunciated before the flight crew applies high reverse thrust.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent adversely affected controllability of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A series airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22141). That action proposed to require modification of the control circuit wiring for the
engine thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 60
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $81,700, or $4,300 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not

Airworthiness Directives; Puritan Bennett Sweep-On Model 2000 Crew Masks 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Puritan Bennett Sweep-On
Model 2000 crew masks installed on various transport and commuter category airplanes. This action requires modification
of certain crew oxygen masks. This amendment is prompted by reports of difficulty in exhaling into certain crew oxygen
masks due to misalignment of the demand diaphragm. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent the flight
crew from experiencing difficulty in exhaling into the affected crew oxygen masks in the event oxygen masks are required
for the crew, such as during depressurization of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, the flight crews from various 
transport and commuter category airplanes reported that they experienced difficulty in exhaling into certain Puritan
Bennett Sweep-On Model 2000 crew oxygen masks. Investigation revealed that the demand diaphragm on these crew oxygen
masks were misaligned, which may have resulted in the seizure of the exhalation valve. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in the flight crew experiencing difficulty in exhaling into the affected crew oxygen masks in the event
oxygen masks are required for the crew, such as during depressurization of the airplane. 



The FAA has reviewed and approved Puritan Bennett Service Bulletin 
174250-35-1, dated August 1994, which describes procedures for modification of certain crew oxygen
masks. This modification entails aligning the demand diaphragm in the vertical position, which would prevent the
seizure of the exhalation valve. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Puritan Bennett Sweep-On
Model 2000 crew oxygen masks that are installed on various transport and commuter category airplanes, this AD is being
issued to prevent the flight crew from experiencing difficulty in exhaling into the affected crew oxygen masks. This
AD requires modification of certain crew oxygen masks. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
94-NM-154-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed

Establishment of Class E Airspace; Inyokern Municipal Airport, Inyokern, CA



<AGENCY>

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA. A Global Positioning System (GPS) standard instrument
approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Inyokern Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending
from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. This action will provide adequate Class
E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Inyokern Municipal Airport.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History




On June 24, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA. (59 FR 32669). A Global Positioning System (GPS) standard instrument approach procedure
(SIAP) has been developed for the Inyokern Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above
the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. One comment was received. China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station requested the exclusion of
Class E airspace from Restricted Area R-2505. The Restricted Area was excluded in response to their request.

The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1.

The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Inyokern, CA, to establish
controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface for aircraft executing the GPS SIAP into the Inyokern Municipal
Airport at Inyokern, CA.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 19, 1989 (54 FR 51946), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 9B4172) had been filed by PPG Industries,
Inc., Pittsburgh, PA 15146, proposing that  176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of

+) alcohols as a component of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous foods.


In its evaluation of the safety of this additive, FDA has reviewed the safety of the additive itself and the chemical
impurities that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself
has not been shown to cause cancer, it may contain minute amounts of unreacted 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, carcinogenic
impurities, resulting from the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids,
such as 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food
additives.


I. Determination of Safety


Under Section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the evidence available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations
(21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
The food additives anticancer, or Delaney, clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) provides that no food additive
shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney
clause applies to the additive itself and not constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive,

II. Safety of the Petitioned Use 


FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive,

'
'

-hexakis(methoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine polymer with stearyl alcohol,

-hydroxypoly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), and alkyl (C

20

+) alcohols, will result in levels of exposure to the additive of no greater than 19 parts per billion in the daily diet
(Ref. 1).
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies on the additive. No adverse
effects were reported in these studies.
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limits of risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicals
that may be present as impurities in the additive, 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide. This risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane
and ethylene oxide has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure to the impurities from the proposed
use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable
exposure to humans.


A. 1,4-Dioxane


FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the petitioned use of the additive in
the manufacture of paper and paperboard to be 11 nanograms per person per day (ng/person/day) (Ref. 1). The agency
used data from a carcinogenesis bioassay on 1,4-dioxane, conducted for the National Cancer Institute (Ref. 3), to
estimate the upper-bound limits of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed
use of the additive (Ref. 3). The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic
for female rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of
squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in female rats.
Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime
risk from the potential exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of the subject additive is 4x10

-10

, or less than 4 in 10 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure
estimate, actual lifetime averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxane is likely to be substantially less than the
worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes
that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to 1,4-dioxane that might result from the proposed
use of the additive.


B. Ethylene Oxide


FDA estimated that the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethylene oxide from the petitioned use of the additive
in the manufacture of paper and paperboard is 11 ng/person/day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from a carcinogenesis
bioassay on ethylene oxide conducted for the Institute of Hygiene, University of Mainz, Germany, to estimate the
upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposure to ethylene oxide stemming from the proposed use of the additive
(Ref. 5). The results of the bioassay on ethylene oxide demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for female
rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cell
carcinomas of the forestomach and carcinoma in situ of the glandular stomach.
Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime
risk from the potential exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the subject additive is 2x10

-8

, or less than 2 in 100 million (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure
estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure to ethylene oxide is likely to be substantially less than
the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency
concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to ethylene oxide that might result from
the proposed use of the additive.


C. Formaldehyde 


A review of the petition also indicates that the additive may contain formaldehyde as an impurity at a dietary concentration
of 15 micrograms/person/day. The potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was reviewed by the Cancer Assessment
Committee (the committee) that has been formed by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The committee
noted that for many years formaldehyde has been known to be a carcinogen by the inhalation route, but it concluded that
these inhalation studies are not appropriate for assessing the potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde in food
because of the inappropriate route administration and the fact that tumors were observed only locally at the portal
of entry (nasal turbinates). The agency has received literature reports of two drinking water studies on formaldehyde:
(1) A preliminary report of a carcinogenicity study purported to be positive by Soffritti et al. (1989), conducted
in Bologna, Italy (Ref. 7), and (2) a negative study by Til, et al. (1989), conducted in The Netherlands (Ref. 8). The
committee reviewed both studies and concluded in a ``Memorandum of Conference,'' dated April 24, 1991 and March 4,
1993, ``* * * that data concerning the Soffritti study reported were unreliable and could not be used
in the assessment of the oral carcinogenicity of formaldehyde'' (Ref. 6). This conclusion is based on a lack of critical
details in the study, questionable histopathologic conclusions, and the use of unusual nomenclature to describe
the tumors. Thus, the committee concluded that there is no basis to find that formaldehyde is a carcinogen when ingested.


D. Need for Specifications


The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary to control the amount of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene
oxide in the additive. The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low levels at which 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide may be expected to remain as impurities following production
of the additive, the agency would not expect these impurities to become components of food at other than extremely
low levels; and (2) the upper-bound limits of lifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst-case
assumptions, is very low, less than 4 in 10 billion and less than 2 in 100 million for 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide,
respectively.


III. Conclusion


FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed uses for the
additive in paper and paperboard products in contact with aqueous food are safe. Based on this information, the agency
has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical effect. Accordingly,  176.170 is amended
as set forth below.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


V. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before October 21, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 20, 1993, in response to requirements in part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA) submitted materials to USEPA pertaining to new source review (NSR) in nonattainment areas. This submittal
included no revisions to any Ohio regulations. Instead, the submittal relied on existing pre-1990 NSR rules, described
how Ohio intended to implement various applicable part D requirements, and presented a rationale that no revisions
to State regulations would be necessary to satisfy these requirements. USEPA disagrees with this rationale and disapproves
the State's submittal for failure to satisfy applicable requirements, as proposed on March 4, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Sections 172, 173, 182, 189, and other sections of the Clean Air Act require States to submit implementation plan provisions
for new source review in nonattainment areas to USEPA for approval or disapproval. Ohio provided various materials
to USEPA between November 1992 and April 1993, but USEPA notified the State on June 1, 1993, that these materials did
not constitute a complete submittal and that the State had failed to submit a complete submittal. On August 20, 1993,
the Ohio provided new material to USEPA addressing new source review in nonattainment areas. USEPA notified OEPA
on October 22, 1993, that it found this August 1993 submittal complete. 
USEPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on the State's submittal on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10349). This document
summarized the history of new source review plans in Ohio, reviewed the submittal of August 20, 1993, and proposed
disapproval of the submittal. In a cover letter accompanying the submittal, the OEPA Director stated that Ohio's
NSR rules adopted in 1974 were sufficient for USEPA to find the State's submission both complete and approvable. According
to the OEPA Director, ``Ohio EPA believes that the current, federally approved, Ohio SIP is adequate for fulfilling
the requirements of a NSR SIP, and that no changes are necessary. . . . Ohio EPA has thoroughly evaluated the basis for
this submittal, and has resolved that the 1974 [NSR] rules remain the vehicle for the U.S. EPA to review as part of this
NSR SIP submittal.'' OEPA also submitted a document dated October 1992 entitled ``Requirements for Major New Sources
in Nonattainment Areas'' (referenced in this document as ``Ohio's statement of permitting criteria''). On page
4 of this latter document, the State again states that ``Ohio EPA needs not modify the current rules to conform to the
legislatively mandated changes under the CAA. In fact, the current state law and Ohio EPA requires that the Director
account for these new requirements in the review of new source applications.'' Ohio thus seeks approval of its existing
pre-1990 NSR rules, along with its statement of permitting criteria, as satisfying the NSR SIP submittal requirements
of part D of title I of the Act, including the new requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 Amendments).
Based on a review of the submittal, USEPA proposed that Ohio's submittal failed to satisfy the NSR SIP submittal requirements
of part D, both for requirements predating the 1990 Amendments as well as new requirements imposed by the 1990 Amendments.
Concerning requirements predating the 1990 Amendments, USEPA explained that the State had failed to make any of the
necessary changes to its NSR rules since USEPA's prior action on September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47211) in which USEPA concluded
that the State had not satisfied the requirements of part D, even as required before 1990, particularly because of
exemptions from NSR permitting for temporary sources and resource recovery facilities. Regarding requirements
imposed by the 1990 Amendments, USEPA noted that Ohio's statement of permitting criteria ``was not adopted according
to the full procedures in Ohio for adoption of regulations, even though this statement is intended to serve purposes
normally served by regulations.'' In an extensive discussion, USEPA also concluded that ``the statement of permitting
criteria lacks the specificity, the regulatory standing, and the assurance of being enforceable that are needed
to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements'' and that the State's reliance ``on a general regulatory provision (requiring
compliance with the Clean Air Act)'' fails to authorize the State to impose the necessary ``specific, detailed permit
conditions.'' Therefore, USEPA proposed to disapprove Ohio's submittal.


II. Comments on Proposed Rulemaking


Subsequent to the proposed rulemaking, Ohio requested an extension of the public comment period, which USEPA granted
on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22776). During the extended comment period, comments were received from OEPA, the local air pollution
control agency for the Dayton area, a law firm, and the State Chamber of Commerce. The following summarizes the comments
received and USEPA's responses.


Comment:

 All four commenters disputed USEPA's proposed conclusion that Ohio's 1974 regulations and its statement of permitting
criteria do not adequately specify applicable new source review requirements. The Chamber of Commerce stated that


Ohio's submittal has the same specificity as Federal law, the law is sufficiently specific and clear, and Ohio's submittal
meets all requirements of that law. The State commented that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are very specific
and clearly specify applicable requirements, such that further efforts to define these requirements by regulation
would be redundant and unnecessary. Another commenter stated that ``specificity and clarity of criteria'' are not
an appropriate basis for disapproving a submittal which has the same specificity and clarity of criteria as the relevant
Federal law, and the fourth commenter stated that ``[d]isagreement over [the form that Ohio's permitting mandates
take rather than over the substance of those mandates] should not be a basis on which to disapprove Ohio's NSR program.''




Response:

 As stated in the proposed disapproval, Ohio's statement of permitting criteria was not adopted pursuant to the applicable
Ohio procedures for the adoption of binding, enforceable regulations and did not clearly identify detailed decisionmaking
criteria, and therefore ``lacks the specificity, the regulatory standing, and the assurance of being enforceable
that are needed to satisfy the Clean Air Act requirements.'' A fundamental principle for SIPs is that SIP measures
must be enforceable. See 57 FR 13498, 13568 (April 16, 1982). In its comments, OEPA did not dispute USEPA's conclusion
that Ohio's statement of permitting criteria does not constitute binding regulations and is unenforceable. Instead,
the State merely responded that ``[t]he requirements of the CAAA are clearly enforceable via existing Ohio regulations''
(emphasis added). Ohio's response makes it clear that its statement of permitting criteria is not enforceable and
that Ohio seeks approval of its submission based on its existing pre-1990 NSR rules. Accordingly, USEPA concludes
that it cannot rely on the unenforceable statement of permitting criteria to approve Ohio's submittal.
USEPA also evaluated whether Ohio's existing NSR rules, adopted well before the 1990 Amendments, satisfy current
NSR SIP requirements. As the State conceded in its statement of permitting criteria, several applicable sections
of the amended Act, including sections 182(a)(2)(C) and 189(a)(2)(A), required states to submit revisions to their
State Implementation Plans for nonattainment NSR permits by various dates in 1992 and 1993. As described above, the
State contends that its existing pre-1990 NSR rules are sufficient to meet current requirements because they require
adherence to ``applicable law,'' including the Clean Air Act. Thus, instead of submitting revisions to its rules,
Ohio asserted that no such revisions are necessary. USEPA disagrees. It should be self-evident that Ohio's reliance
on its existing pre-1990 NSR rules does not satisfy the statutory mandates enacted in 1990 for revisions to the State's
NSR rules. USEPA reaffirms its view that a reference in existing state rules to the Clean Air Act, and references to
pre-1990 sections of the Act, do not satisfy current NSR SIP requirements.
USEPA believes that the Act requires States to adopt specific, enforceable rules to implement the Act's requirements
for a nonattainment new source review program. Although not mandated by the Act, USEPA has already provided general
guidance to states concerning NSR SIP requirements (See 57 FR 13498, 13552-13556 (April 16, 1982); 57 FR 55620,
55623-55624 (Nov. 25, 1992)), and plans to issue further guidance and rules concerning NSR SIP measures later
in 1994. Although certain provisions in the Act may present questions of statutory interpretation, USEPA finds that
Ohio's NSR submission, consisting primarily of existing pre-1990 NSR rules supplemented by the unenforceable statement
of permitting criteria completely fail to satisfy the statutory obligation to submit specific revisions to its NSR
SIP rules.

1







This regulatory situation is typical. Statutes usually establish general requirements and usually cannot be successfully
implemented without detailed regulations clearly specifying criteria for evaluating individual cases. Thus,
the issue is not simply philosophical or superficial, but rather a fundamental question of whether Ohio has properly
set forth a regulatory framework under which to implement the mandated provisions, and whether USEPA or a member of
the public could successfully object if a permit were proposed that would violate NSR requirements.
USEPA believes that it would be difficult and impractical for a commenter to object to a proposed permit based on statutory
provisions in the amended Act where USEPA had approved the SIP as satisfying the requirements of the amended Act but
where the SIP did not contain specific provisions to implement the amended Act. USEPA further believes that Federal
enforcement of NSR requirements would be severely jeopardized by USEPA approval of NSR SIP provisions that fail to
contain specific provisions implementing the amended Act. Ohio's SIP submission fails to provide enforceable NSR
provisions which assure compliance with the amended Act and therefore are disapproved.
A discussion of comments and responses below addresses specific requirements for offsets, offset ratios, and major
source and major modification definitions. The technical support document for the proposed rulemaking also identified
deficiencies with respect to the alternatives analysis requirement, and observed that Ohio's statement of permitting
criteria mistakenly assigns various USEPA responsibilities regarding clean coal technology demonstration projects
to OEPA, such as promulgation of national regulations and review of other States' submittals. No comments were submitted
on these latter deficiencies, and so they remain as additional examples of Ohio's submittal being inadequate to implement
the mandated requirements.


Comment:

 The State further commented regarding emissions offsets that ``[t]hese requirements are all contained and specified
in either Federal rules, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 or in Ohio EPA policy.'' 


Response:

 As discussed above, Ohio's existing NSR rules do not contain (either directly or by reference) a definition of offset
ratios reflecting the amended Clean Air Act. Ohio observes that the Clean Air Act identifies the values of the ratios
to be used in various circumstances. However, Ohio does not address the concern identified in the NPR with the absence
(in either the existing NSR rules or Ohio's statement of permitting criteria) of detailed, explicit criteria for
evaluating offset ratios. Relevant criteria include whether fugitive or secondary emissions (with or without mobile
source emissions) are to be included in computing the ratio, what averaging time to use, whether the numerator or denominator
is to be potential to emit or actual emissions, and where the offsets may occur. Since these criteria are not explicit
or implicit elements of Ohio's rules, it would be difficult and impractical to implement the mandated offset ratios
effectively and consistent with the Clean Air Act.


Comment:

 The State agrees that ``Appendix S is not explicit in requiring annual, actual offsets,'' but observes that this requirement
has been established by OEPA policy and is given in Ohio's submitted statement of permitting criteria.


Response:

 USEPA acknowledges that OEPA interprets its regulation to require annual, actual offsets. However, this requirement
should be given full regulatory standing by being incorporated into enforceable Ohio regulations.


Comment:

 The State asserts that it has properly relied on definitions which are given in appendix S to 40 CFR part 51.


Response:

 The definitions in appendix S are insufficient because of differences between appendix S and the amended Clean Air
Act. Appendix S defines major stationary sources as sources with the potential to emit 100 tons per year (or sources
modified such that potential to emit increases by 100 tons per year). The Clean Air Act provides that the term ``major
stationary source'' in some areas includes sources with lower potential to emit, such as 50 tons per year in Serious
ozone nonattainment areas. See section 182 of the Act. Since Ohio's regulations reference both the Clean Air Act and
appendix S, Ohio's regulations are unclear as to which cutoffs apply. 


Comment:

 The State commented on USEPA's uncertainty as to whether the State intended in its statement of permitting criteria
to lower the threshold of nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) source sizes at which major modifications would trigger new source review. The State commented it ``does not intend
to change this threshold.''


Response:

 Notwithstanding its recent comments, the State did not change its statement of permitting criteria. Thus, Ohio's
submittal contains a statement of permitting criteria that contradicts the criteria for major NO

x

 modifications given by reference (i.e. in appendix S) in Ohio's regulations.


Comment:

 Three commenters commented that requiring new State regulations every time Federal rules change would cause delays
and reduce the adaptability of the new source review process.


Response:

 With respect to the requirements of the 1990 Amendments, this rulemaking does not concern whether hypothetical Federal
rule changes would require State rule revisions but rather whether the 1990 Amendments require State rule revisions.
The Clean Air Act has had significant amendments only twice since 1970, whereas Ohio has changed its Permit to Install
(NSR) rules eight times during the same period. The commenters seek an approach that allows one set of State rules to
impose changing requirements in accordance with changes in Federal mandates, but such approaches are prone to be
too vague as to the precise obligations of regulated entities imposed by the rules and statute. In this particular
case, the State's reference to the general mandates in the amended Clean Air Act does not provide sufficient specificity
on the implementation of these mandates to be enforceable. In any event, Congress clearly provided for States to revise
their SIP rules in accordance with the 1990 Amendments.
These comments raise a further issue, namely the extent to which a State may change permitting requirements without
providing opportunity for public input by means of a rule revision process. Ohio argues that the State's regulations
provide for the applicability of requirements resulting from subsequent Clean Air Act amendments even without revision
of the State rules. Under this view, there would be no reason for any State SIP submittal at all, and therefore no opportunity
for public review and comment on the changed requirements. This runs counter to the general principle that regulations
are to be interpreted based on requirements contemplated at the time of regulation adoption and not on the basis of
subsequently devised criteria. For this reason as well, the State and USEPA would face obstacles in trying to enforce
the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.


Comment:

 The State comments ``U.S. EPA had expressed a concern about certain items that were identified in the Clean Air Act
as part of the review of new sources which were not identified in either state or Federal rules. Ohio EPA proposed a policy
that includes these additional Federal requirements. The policy was issued in proposed format and a public hearing
was held on the document. After a review of the comments, Ohio EPA submitted that policy as part of the State Implementation
Plan.''


Response:

 The State implicitly agrees that certain requirements in the Clean Air Act are not addressed by any rules contained
or referenced in the State's SIP, which suggests further that these requirements have not been given regulatory standing
in Ohio. The notice of proposed rulemaking focussed on Ohio's statement of permitting criteria, which USEPA finds
to be an inadequate instrument for giving these requirements regulatory standing, notwithstanding that this policy
statement was subject to public hearing. (Ohio had previously provided essentially the same policy statement without
public review, but USEPA judged this and related material not to constitute a complete submittal.)


Comment:

 The State commented on USEPA's concern that two source categories (certain types of municipal waste combustors and
temporary sources) are exempted by appendix S and thus by Ohio rules and yet are not to be exempted under 40 CFR 51.165.
The State commented that Ohio permits must comply with Federal law, Federal law does not permit these exemptions,
and so the State has developed guidance that these exemptions do not apply.


Response:

 The State did not submit to USEPA the guidance that it claims provides that these exemptions do not apply. The State's
SIP does contain appendix S, incorporated by reference in Rule 3745-31-05, and indeed relies on appendix
S to interpret applicable new source review requirements. Consequently, Ohio's regulations are to be interpreted
as also providing the exemptions in appendix S and therefore do not satisfy even the pre-1990 NSR requirements of part
D of title I of the Act.


Comment:

 A local air pollution control agency comments that USEPA's involvement in permit oversight assures that Federal
requirements will not be misapplied.


Response:

 Although USEPA agrees that its permit oversight can improve the quality of State permits, such an oversight program
is not a substitute for an approvable SIP. USEPA cannot through oversight establish or correct requirements which
are not correctly provided in the State regulations.


Comment:

 A commenter believes that USEPA acknowledges that Ohio's statutes and regulation ``already require that the provisions
of the amended Clean Air Act be met.''


Response:

 The commenter is quoting statements that USEPA used to characterize the State's position; these statements do not
represent USEPA's position.


III. Final Action


Notwithstanding comments to the contrary, USEPA's review indicates that Ohio's submittal does not clearly establish
the specific criteria required by the Act by which judgments in new source permitting will be made. Furthermore, by
relying not on properly adopted regulations but rather on a general regulatory provision (requiring compliance
with the Clean Air Act) in conjunction with an unenforceable statement of permitting criteria, the State has failed
to adopt enforceable SIP provisions to implement an NSR program in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements.
Furthermore, Ohio's existing regulations exempt two types of sources which may not be exempted under the Act and applicable
USEPA regulations. For these reasons, USEPA takes final action to disapprove Ohio's submittal for failure to satisfy
part D requirements.
Under section 179(a)(2), one of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) shall apply unless the deficiency has been
corrected within 18 months of the effective date of this disapproval. Extensive discussion of USEPA's sanctions
procedures is given in the 

Federal Register

 of August 4, 1994, at 59 FR 39832. Pursuant to 40 CFR 52.31, unless a revised plan has been submitted and proposed for
approval in the meantime, a requirement for two-for-one offsets shall apply to any permits issued after [insert date
18 months after 30 days from date of publication] for major new sources and modifications in nonattainment areas.
Highway funding sanctions shall apply [insert date 24 months after 30 days from date of publication], again unless
a revised plan has been submitted and proposed for approval in the meantime. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this disapproval
action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing
requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation 
of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Ohio 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is approving a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Preble, Columbiana, and Jefferson Counties,
Ohio as a revision to Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. 


The revision is based on a request from the State of Ohio to redesignate these areas, and approve their maintenance
plans, and on the supporting data the State submitted. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient
data are available to warrant such change. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under Section 107(d) of the pre-amended Clean Air Act (CAA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
promulgated the ozone attainment status for each area of every State. For Ohio, Preble, Columbiana, and Jefferson
Counties were designated as nonattainment areas for ozone. See 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October
5, 1978). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat.
2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. Pursuant to Section 107(d)(1)(C) of the CAA, Preble, Jefferson, and
Columbiana Counties retained their designations of nonattainment for ozone by operation of law. See 56 FR 56694 (November
6, 1991). At the same time Preble, and Jefferson Counties were classified as transitional areas; and Columbiana County
was classified as an incomplete data area.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) requested that Preble County be redesignated to attainment in a
letter dated May 23, 1986; and that Jefferson and Columbiana Counties be redesignated to attainment in a letter dated
July 14, 1986. On December 20, 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposed to disapprove
the requested redesignations (see 58 FR 66334). The public comment period was from December 20, 1993, to January 19,
1994. In a January 18, 1994, letter, the State of Ohio requested a 90-day extension of the comment period. On February
18, 1994, the USEPA extended the comment period until April 19, 1994 (see 59 FR 8150). The OEPA submitted maintenance
and contingency plans for the counties in a submittal dated April 14, 1994, and requested parallel processing of the
submittal. The results of OEPA's public hearing and resulting revision to the maintenance and contingency plan was
submitted in a letter dated August 10, 1994. Notwithstanding these submittals, no public comments specifically
commenting on the proposed rulemaking were received during the extended comment period. 


I. Review of the Requests 


The State's May 23, 1986, and July 14, 1986, requests were previously reviewed in a proposed rulemaking published
on December 20, 1993, (see 58 FR 66334) in which USEPA proposed to disapprove the requests due to a lack of maintenance
and contingency plans and enforceability deficiencies in their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available
Control Technology (RACT) regulations. Since that time the State has submitted additional information to address
the basis of the proposed disapproval. The review of the previous submittal and the basic redesignation requirements
are not summarized in this notice, but the reader is referred to the December 20, 1993, notice referenced above for
a summary of the requirements and the previous submittal. The April 14, 1994, and August 10, 1994, submittals are summarized
below and the requirements that were not met in the original submittal are addressed below. 
Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement
to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under
title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions
(``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States
must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required the USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided
for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of the final USEPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the implementation of Title I informed
States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date. See 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992).

The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and
section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Ohio is required to submit SIP revisions containing transportation
and general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November
25 and 30, 1994, respectively. Because the deadline for such submittals has not yet come due, it is not an applicable
requirement, under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v), for approval of this redesignation request. 


A. Preble County 


The maintenance plan provided for this county consists of an emissions and air quality summary; a mobile, area, and
point source emissions inventory; and Permits-to-Install for all subject sources in Preble County. 
The emissions summary for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) are provided below: 













The total emissions are projected to decrease in the county, and, as a result, the county is expected to maintain the
ozone air quality standard for the next ten (10) years. The mobile source NO

X

 and VOC emissions projections for the year 2005 will be the ``budget'' for transportation conformity purposes. The
air quality monitoring data submitted by the State shows that the area is still in attainment of the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. 
Preble County, which was designated nonattainment prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, must
correct existing RACT rules for enforceability deficiencies. See 57 FR 13562. The State submitted copies of Permits-to-Install
for all subject sources in the county. These permits indicate that no sources in the county are affected by a Volatile
Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rule that has an enforceability deficiency.
The one source that would have been affected (degreaser) was permanently shut down. This satisfies the requirement
for correcting enforceability deficiencies in the county. 
The maintenance plan also includes a contingency measure that the State will use to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS
for ozone. The State has committed to lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) gasoline as the contingency measure. This would
be implemented in the case of a violation in the area. In order for the State to use lower RVP gasoline, a finding of necessity
must first be made by USEPA under Section 211(c)(4)(C). If this finding of necessity is not provided, Ohio EPA has committed
to choose an alternative unspecified emission control measure deemed appropriate based upon a consideration of
cost-effectiveness, VOC reduction potential, economic and social considerations, or other factors that the State
judges to be appropriate. This decision would be made and implemented within 12 months from the official notification
by USEPA that a waiver would not be granted. OEPA also provided the following schedule for implementing the lower RVP
measure: 






B. Jefferson County 


The maintenance plan provided for this county consists of emissions, and air quality summaries; and mobile, area,
and point source emissions inventories.

The total emissions are projected to decrease in the county and, as a result, the county is expected to maintain the
ozone air quality standard. The mobile source NO

quality monitoring data submitted by the State shows that the area is still in attainment of the NAAQS for ozone. 
The maintenance plan also includes a contingency measure that the State will use to ensure maintenance of the NAAQS
for ozone. This is the same plan that is outlined above for Preble County. 
This county is similar to Preble in that it is a transitional area. The main difference between them is that Jefferson
County was never included in the post 1987 SIP call letters issued by USEPA to OEPA (dated May 26, 1988, and November
8, 1989), and was never cited as having RACT deficiencies, as Jefferson County was not in violation of the NAAQS. Thus
Jefferson County is not subject to a requirement to correct RACT deficiencies. 


C. Columbiana County 


The maintenance plan provided for this county consisted of an emissions summary; and mobile, area, and point source
emissions inventories. 
The emissions summaries for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) are provided below:

This county is similar to Jefferson in that it was not included in the post 1987 USEPA SIP call letters to OEPA, and was
never cited as having RACT deficiencies, as Columbiana County was not in violation of the NAAQS. Thus Columbiana County
is not subject to a requirement to correct RACT deficiencies.

Rulemaking Action 


The ozone redesignation requests for Preble, Jefferson, and Columbiana Counties are approved as meeting conditions
of the CAA in section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation, since: (1) The area has attained the NAAQS for ozone; (ii) The
Administrator has fully approved the applicable implementation plan for the area under Section 110(k); (iii) The
improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation
of the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal air pollutant control regulations; (iv) The Administrator
is fully approving maintenance plans for the counties as meeting the requirements of section 175A; and (v) Ohio has
met all requirements applicable to the counties under section 110 and part D. 
Because USEPA considers this action to be noncontroversial and routine, the USEPA is approving it without prior approval.
This action will become effective on November 21, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by October
21, 1994, then the USEPA will publish a document that withdraws the action, and will address these comments in the final
rule on the requested redesignation and SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section

This action has been classified as a Table three (3) action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table two (2) and three (3) SIP revisions (54 FR 222)
from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two (2) years. USEPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table two (2) and Table three (3) SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866
review. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under Section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any

will not affect a substantial number of small entities. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State
of North Carolina 



<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 27, 1994, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Management (NCDEM), submitted a maintenance plan
and a request to redesignate the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area from nonattainment to attainment for carbon
monoxide (CO). The CO nonattainment area consists only of Forsyth County. Under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990
(CAA), designations can be revised if sufficient data is available to warrant such revisions. In this action, EPA
is approving the North Carolina request because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements set
forth in the CAA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 



In a March 15, 1991, letter to the EPA Region IV Administrator, the Governor of North Carolina recommended the area
of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County be designated as nonattainment for CO as required by section 107(d)(1)(A) of the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA) (Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q).
The city was designated nonattainment and classified as ``moderate'' under the provisions outlined in sections
186 and 187 of the CAA. (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR part 81,  81.334.)
Because Winston-Salem had a design value of 9.7 ppm (based on 1988 and 1989 data), the area was considered moderate.
The CAA established an attainment date of December 31, 1995, for all moderate CO areas. 

Forsyth County has ambient monitoring data showing attainment of the CO NAAQS, during the period from 1990 through
1993. The area has continued to monitor attainment to date in 1994. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the CAA and
to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on April 27, 1994, the State of North Carolina submitted a CO redesignation
request and a maintenance plan for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. The request for redesignation submittal
and maintenance plan was approved by NCEMC on April 14, 1994. North Carolina submitted evidence that a public hearing
was held on March 25 and 28, 1994. 



II. Evaluation Criteria 



The 1990 CAA Amendments revised section 107(d)(1)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet
in order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 

1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 

2. The area must meet all applicable requirements under section 110 and Part D of the CAA; 

3. The area must have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of CAA;

<DOCNO> FR940921-0-00019 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and, 
5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the CAA. 


III. Review of State Submittal 


On June 14, 1994, Region IV determined that the information received from the NCDEM constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V,   2.1 and 2.2. 
The North Carolina redesignation request for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area meets the five requirements
of section 107(d)(3)(E), noted above. The following is a brief description of how the State has fulfilled each of these
requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss
its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. 


1. Attainment of the CO NAAQS 


The North Carolina request is based on an analysis of quality assured CO air monitoring data which is relevant to the
maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. The ambient air CO monitoring data for calendar year 1990 through
calendar year 1993 shows no violations of the CO NAAQS in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. The most recent ambient
CO data for the calendar year 1994 continue to show no violations in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. Because
the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area has complete quality assured data showing no more than one exceedance of the
standard per year over at least two consecutive years, the area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment
of the CO NAAQS (40 CFR 50.9 and appendix C). North Carolina has committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance
with 40 CFR part 58. 


2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D


The 1990 CAA Amendments, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements
for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain
all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were
due under the 1990 Amendments prior to or at the time the State submitted its redesignation request. 


A. Section 110 Requirements 


Although section 110 was amended by the 1990 Amendments, the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County SIP meets the requirements
of amended section 110(a)(2). The State implemented an Oxygenated Fuel program for the areas of Raleigh/Durham and
Winston-Salem during the 1992 and 1993 winter seasons. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent
with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). 


B. Part D Requirements 


Before Winston-Salem/Forsyth County may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable
requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject.
Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified
as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 3 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified
under section 186(a). The Winston-Salem area was classified as moderate (See 40 CFR 81.334). Therefore, in order
to be redesignated to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically
sections 172(c) and 176, and the requirements of subpart 3 of part D, which became due on or before April 27, 1994, the
date the State submitted a complete redesignation request. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(v) to mean that, for
a redesignation request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that become applicable to the subject
area prior to or at time of the submission of the redesignation request. The area will become subject to the CAA that
come due subsequent to the submission of the redesignation request until the request is approved (See section 175A(c))
and if the redesignation is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. 


B1. Subpart 1 of Part D

_Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the
section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after
an area is designated as nonattainment. Because Winston-Salem was designated as a new CO nonattainment area on June
6, 1992, the requirements are not due until June 6, 1995. Therefore, the submission of a New Source Review program and
contingency measures required under 172(c) are not yet due. The Region is, however, in the process of approving the
State's revised NSR regulation which includes CO nonattainment areas. Upon redesignation of these areas to attainment,
the Prevent of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On June 12,
1975, December 30, 1976, June 19, 1978, August 7, 1980, February 23, 1982, and August 15, 1994, EPA approved revisions
to the State of North Carolina's PSD program (See 40 FR 25004, 41 FR 56805, 43 FR 26388, 45 FR 52676, 47 FR 7836, 59 FR 41708).

B2. Subpart 1 of Part D

_Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement
to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under
Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the
conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA
required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation
of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for
the Implementation of Title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see
57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)). 

EPA promulgated final conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214).
These conformity rules require that the States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the
SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant
to  51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and  51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State
of North Carolina is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures
consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, North Carolina is required
to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established
in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not
applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation
request. 


B3. Subpart 3 of Part D

_Under section 187(a) areas designated nonattainment for CO under the amended CAA and classified as moderate were
required to meet several requirements by November 15, 1992. North Carolina was required to submit a 1990 Emission
Inventory. EPA has reviewed and is approving in this notice North Carolina's 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory. The
requirement to make I/M corrections are not applicable to Forsyth County since it was not a pre-enactment nonattainment
area, and therefore did not have an existing program before the CAA. Section 211(m) further required North Carolina
to submit an oxygenated fuels regulation for the Winston-Salem area. North Carolina submitted a complete Oxygenated
Fuel SIP on November 20, 1992. The Oxygenated Fuel Program is fully adopted and has been approved by EPA (See 59 FR 33683
published on June 30, 1994). Therefore, all Subpart 3 requirements that were applicable at the time the State submitted
its redesignation request have been met. 


3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA


Based on EPA's approval of SIP revisions under the 1990 Amendments, EPA has determined that the Winston-Salem/Forsyth
County area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section
110 and Part D as discussed above. 


4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures


The control measures to which the emission reductions are attributed mostly to the Federal Motor Vehicle Control
Program (FMVCP). The fleet turnover under the FMVCP produced annual CO emission reductions of 6 percent. 

In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of North Carolina has demonstrated that actual
enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the air quality improvement and that the CO emissions in the
base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn. EPA finds that the combination of certain existing
EPA-approved SIP and federal measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reduction in ambient CO
levels that have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS. 


5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A


Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. In this notice,
EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's maintenance plan for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area because
EPA finds that North Carolina's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A. 


A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 


On November 16, 1992, the State of North Carolina submitted a comprehensive inventory of CO emissions from the Winston-Salem/Forsyth
County area. The inventory includes emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year
for calculations. The 1990 inventory is considered representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was
not violated during 1990. 
The State submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. The comprehensive
base year emissions inventory was submitted in the National Emission Data System format. Finally, this inventory
was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. It also contains summary tables of the 1990 base year and was projected
to the year 2005.

<TEXT>
 

B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories 


Total CO emissions were projected from 1990 base year out to 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance
with EPA guidance. North Carolina will not continue the Oxygenated Fuel program in Winston-Salem. The projections
show that calculated CO emissions, assuming no oxygenated fuels program after 1993, are not expected to exceed the
level of the base year inventory during this time period. Therefore, it is anticipated that Winston-Salem will maintain
the CO standard without the program, and the program would no longer be implemented following redesignation. In case
of an air quality problem, the program may be implemented as a contingency measure. 



C. Verification of Continued Attainment 


Continued attainment of the CO NAAQS in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area depends, in part, on the State's efforts
toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State has also committed
to submit periodic inventories of CO emissions every three years. 



D. Contingency Plan 


The level of CO emissions in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance
with the CO NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS,
the ambient air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Also, section 175(A)(d) of the CAA requires
that the contingency provisions include a requirement that the State implement all measures contained in the SIP
prior to redesignation. Therefore, North Carolina has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation
in the event of a future CO air quality problem. The plan contains triggering mechanisms to determine when contingency
measures are needed. The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County contingency plan's primary trigger will be a violation of
the CO NAAQS. A secondary trigger will be activated within 30 days of the State finding either: (1) The periodic emissions
inventory exceeds the base inventory by 10 percent or more, or (2) a monitored air quality exceedance pattern indicates
that an actual CO NAAQS violation may be imminent. A pattern will be deemed to indicate an imminent violation if: (a)
One exceedance of the standard per year has been monitored at a single monitor for two successive years and those exceedances
are at least greater than 20 percent above the standard (i.e., 10.8 ppm or above) or (b) the monitored air quality exceedance
pattern otherwise suggest that a CO NAAQS violation is likely. Within 45 days of the trigger, the State will activate
the pre-adopted regulations discussed below to become effective at the beginning of the next CO season. When other
measures are needed to ensure that a future violation of the CO NAAQS does not occur, the State will complete the adoption
process within one year of the secondary trigger. As the State has demonstrated that the area will continue to maintain
the standard without the Oxygenated Fuels program, the State will make that program a contingency measure that will
be implemented in the event of a trigger being activated. In case of a primary or secondary trigger, NCDEM will implement
an oxygenated gasoline fuel program or expand an already-existing program's coverage. In addition, NCDEM may do
one or a combination of the following: expand the I/M program coverage; upgrade to an enhanced I/M program; institute
transportation control measures; or implement an employee commute options program. EPA finds that the contingency
measures provided in the State submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA. 


E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 


In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years
after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten
years.

Final Action 


EPA is approving the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County CO maintenance plan because it meets the requirements set forth
in section 175A of the CAA. In addition, the Agency is approving the request and redesignating the Winston-Salem/Forsyth
County CO area to attainment, because the State has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)
for redesignation. 
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective November 7, 1994 unless, by October 21, 1994 adverse or critical comments are received. 
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective November 7, 1994. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The CO SIP is designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CAA and to provide for attainment and maintenance
of the CO NAAQS. This final redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State to delete, alter, or rescind
any of the CO emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved CO SIP. Changes to CO SIP regulations
rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for
attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes
could result in both a finding of non-implementation (section 179(a) of the CAA) and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant
to sections 110(a)(2)(H) and 110(k)(2) of the CAA. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et 
seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, it does not have any economic impact on any small entities. Redesignation of an area to attainment
under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an
action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources.
Accordingly, I certify that the approval of the redesignation request will not have an impact on any small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Summary of Proposed Rulemaking 



A subsequent submittal provided stack test data for one of the relevant facilities. On March 18, 1994, at 59 FR 12886,
USEPA proposed to approve maintenance plans and redesignation of Morgan and Washington Counties, Ohio, from nonattainment
to attainment for sulfur dioxide (SO

2

). In that document, USEPA did not propose to take action on the maintenance plans and redesignation request for Gallia
and Coshocton Counties. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) included a background synopsis of the State's submittals
and the applicable criteria, a full review of the State's submittals, and a summary of the proposed action. The NPR
contained five subsections corresponding to the five criteria for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment
given in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act. In the NPR, USEPA made the following proposed findings: (i) All
four counties are attaining the 24-hour air quality standard, Morgan and Washington Counties are attaining the 3-hour
standard, and USEPA did not evaluate whether Coshocton and Gallia Counties are attaining the 3-hour standard; (ii)
USEPA considered approval of the Morgan and Washington County plans under section 110(a)(2) to satisfy section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii)
for these counties, but ``based on questions as to whether (Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs)) satisfy the requirements
of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii),'' USEPA deferred action on Ohio's request for Coshocton and Gallia Counties; (iii)
USEPA judged all four counties to have permanent and enforceable emission reductions; (iv) USEPA judged the maintenance
plans for Morgan and Washington Counties adequate, and did not evaluate the maintenance plans for Coshocton and Gallia
Counties; and (v) USEPA judged that Ohio had satisfied the requirements of section 110 and part D of title I for Morgan
and Washington Counties, and did not evaluate whether these requirements were satisfied for Coshocton and Gallia
Counties. On the basis of this review, USEPA proposed to approve the maintenance plans and redesignation request
for Morgan and Washington Counties and did not propose action for Coshocton and Gallia Counties. 


II. Public Comments/USEPA Responses 


One letter commenting on the proposed rulemaking was received, submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
(OEPA). This letter included as an attachment a letter commenting on the same issues, sent from Ohio Governor Voinovich
to Administrator Carol Browner prior to publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments in these letters
and USEPA's responses follow:
 


Comment:

 Ohio supports the proposed action with respect to Morgan and Washington Counties. 


Response:

 USEPA received no adverse comments on this part of its proposal, and, for the reasons provided in the proposal, concludes
that the maintenance plans and redesignation request for these counties should be approved. 


Comment:

 The State objects to USEPA's decision to defer action on the redesignation of Coshocton and Gallia Counties, and in
particular presents arguments that areas subject to FIP limits (promulgated under section 110(c) of the Clean Air
Act) rather than SIP limits (approved under section 110(k) or its equivalent) may be redesignated. Ohio argues that
FIP limits are equivalent to SIP limits. The State cites language previously in section 110(d) (essentially moved
to section 302(q) by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) that the ``implementation plan'' includes both approved
State submittals and federally promulgated measures. The State comments that if areas with FIPs could not be redesignated,
then ``U.S. EPA could never promulgate a FIP because such a plan would not provide for attainment redesignations and
thus would be incomplete,'' and ``nonattainment areas would be frozen, even though air quality may be demonstrably
improved.'' 
Also, the Governor commented that designations are based on air quality and that FIPs provide for permanent air quality
improvement. The Governor concluded that Coshocton and Gallia Counties have been exhibiting attainment for 14 years,
and that obstruction to the attainment status of these counties is based on a narrow interpretation of the Clean Air
based on ``periodic changes in review requirements,'' and is inappropriate and unnecessary. 


Response:

 Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act, as amended in 1990, precludes USEPA from redesignating areas subject to FIPs, such
as Coshocton and Gallia Counties to attainment. That section of the Act prohibits USEPA from redesignating a nonattainment
area to attainment unless the area satisfies certain explicit statutory criteria. It provides that: 
The Administrator may not promulgate a redesignation of a nonattainment area (or portion thereof) to attainment
unless_ 
(i) The Administrator determines that the area has attained the national ambient air quality standard; 
(ii) The Administrator has fully approved the applicable implementation plan for the area under section 110(k);

(iii) The Administrator determines that the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions
in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal air pollutant
control regulations and other permanent and enforceable reductions; 
(iv) The Administrator has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section 175A;
and

<PARENT> FR940921-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(v) The State containing such area has met all requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D.

As is evident, several criteria must be satisfied for an area to be redesignated to attainment apart from attaining
the national ambient air quality standard and the determination that improvements in air quality are due to permanent
and enforceable reductions in emissions. It is those criteria, especially that in clauses (ii), (iv) and (v), that
are pertinent with respect to the issue of whether a nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment if there
is FIP, rather than a SIP, in place.

First, the language of clause (ii) requires that for USEPA to redesignate an area, USEPA must have ``fully approved
the applicable implementation plan for the area under section 110(k).'' This clause clearly requires that a SIP be
in place. Only SIPs are approved by USEPA; FIPs are not approved, but promulgated. More importantly, the clause refers
to approval under section 110(k), the provision of the Act setting forth the procedure for USEPA to act on SIP revisions
submitted to the Agency by states. Thus, a FIP does not qualify as a plan approved under section 110(k). In contrast,
the language of section 302(q) defines the term ``applicable attainment plan'' as meaning a FIP or a SIP. Thus, it defines
``applicable implementation plan'' as ``the portion (or portions) of the implementation plan, or most recent revision
thereof, which has been approved under section 110 (a SIP, which is referred to in section 107(d)), or promulgated
under section 110(c) (a FIP, which is not referred to in section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii)).''

Second, clause (iv) requires that USEPA have fully approved a maintenance plan as meeting the requirements of section
175A. Section 175A(a) requires that each State that submits a redesignation request to submit ``a revision of the
applicable State implementation plan to provide for maintenance of the national primary ambient air quality standard,''
and thus clearly presupposes that a SIP, not a FIP, will be in place prior to redesignation.

Third, clause (v) requires that, in order to have an area redesignated to attainment, the State containing the area
must meet ``all requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D.'' As these requirements concern
various SIP submissions, this clause also implicitly means that USEPA cannot approve a redesignation request for
an area that is subject to a FIP.

Thus, the language of section 107(d)(3) plainly prohibits USEPA from redesignating an area to attainment if that
area is subject to a FIP. This outcome is fully consistent with a fundamental policy underlying the law_that the states
have primary responsibility for attaining and maintaining air quality standards and that FIPs are intended to be
only short-term measures to fill gaps in control strategies. Further evidence of this policy is provided by the fact
that sanctions imposed under section 179 due to a state's failure to comply with its SIP obligations are not suspended
or lifted due to USEPA's promulgation of a FIP pursuant to its obligations under section 110(c).

USEPA also notes that areas subject to FIPs are not frozen in place as nonattainment areas. Assuming that the area continued
to satisfy the national ambient air quality standards, the area would be eligible for redesignation to attainment
once the state submitted approvable SIP revisions as required by the Act, and submitted an approvable state maintenance
plan.



Comment:

 In another argument for redesignating areas with FIP-based plans, the State interprets section 110(n)(1), the ``Savings
Clause,'' as providing that ``[t]he authority of USEPA to redesignate nonattainment areas under a section 110(c)
plan would remain unchanged as a result of the 1990 Amendments.'' The State believes that former section 110(d) provided
this authority prior to the 1990 amendments.



Response:

 Section 110(n)(1) authorizes the enforcement of plan elements approved prior to 1990. It does not authorize USEPA
to ignore post-1990 Clean Air Act criteria in judging the acceptability of States' requests. The requirement now
in section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) requiring a plan approved under section 110(k) was not included in the pre-1990 Clean
Air Act or in USEPA's guidance. However, this requirement is applicable now under the Act.



Comment:

 The Governor commented that ``[a]reas with FIPs have been redesignated in Ohio in the past,'' indicating that USEPA
agreed that FIPs provide for permanent air quality improvement, and indicating further that Gallia and Coshocton
Counties should be redesignated.



Response:

 Regardless of the situation prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the requirements of section
107(d)(3)(E) are applicable under the Act now, and must be satisfied as a prerequisite for redesignating an area from
nonattainment to attainment.



Comment:

 The State comments that USEPA should not use 1.95 as the conversion factor from coal sulfur content to sulfur dioxide
emissions, but should instead use the factor of 1.9 given in Supplement F of AP-42 (dated July 1993).



Response:

 USEPA agrees with the State's comment. Since the fuel quality information indicated the air quality standards being
met using a 1.95 conversion factor, the fuel quality information also indicates the air quality standards being met
using a 1.9 conversion factor.

III. Rulemaking Action 


USEPA has reviewed the State's submittals and other related material and, for the reasons stated in the proposal,
has concluded that the maintenance plan and redesignation request for Morgan and Washington Counties satisfy the
applicable criteria for approval. Consequently, USEPA approves the maintenance plan for SO

2

 for Morgan and Washington Counties, and redesignates these two counties to attainment. USEPA continues to defer
action with respect to Ohio's maintenance plans and redesignation requests for Coshocton and Gallia Counties. 
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action under the processing procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 22291 for a period
of 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed
to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under
Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
 Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 90-Day Finding on Petition To Add the Flatwoods Salamander to the
List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of recision of previous 90-day petition finding for the flatwoods salamander, and issuance of a new finding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) rescinds the previous 90-day finding made on a petition to list the flatwoods
salamander (

Ambystoma cingulatum

) as an endangered or threatened species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The previous
finding, made on May 6, 1993, indicated that the petition did not present substantial information that the petitioned
action may be warranted. The current finding, based upon recent changes to the Service's draft internal guidance
for petition management, is that the petition presents substantial information that the requested action may be
warranted. A formal review of the species' status is initiated pursuant to the current 90-day finding.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended, requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist
or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial information to demonstrate that the petitioned
action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, the finding shall be made within 90 days following receipt
of the petition and promptly published in the 

Federal Register

. The Service must also commence a timely status review of the petitioned species if its accompanying information
results in a positive finding. Following a positive 90-day finding, Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Service
to make a 12-month finding as to whether the petitioned action is: (1) Not warranted, (2) warranted; or (3) warranted
but precluded by other listing activity. 

On May 18, 1992, the Service received a petition from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Ms. Elizabeth Carlton
to list the flatwoods salamander as endangered or threatened and to designate critical habitat. The petition states
that available evidence indicates the population of the flatwoods salamander has declined precipitously, that
it is on the threshold of extirpation in many locations, that it has been extirpated from a large portion of its historic
range, and that it has suffered rapid decline in National Forests. After a review of all available information, the
Service made a 90-day petition finding on May 6, 1993, that the petition did not present substantial information that
the petitioned action may be warranted; the finding was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27986). The primary basis for the finding was that the petitioners did not present any information
not already in possession of the Service, and a status review of the species was already in progress through the inclusion
of the species as a category 2 candidate in the Service's comprehensive notice of review for animal candidates. Category
2 candidates are taxa for which information in the possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered
or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are
not currently available to support proposed rules. 

On August 12, 1993, the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Elizabeth Carlton notified the Service of intent to file
a lawsuit challenging the 90-day finding, and on April 25, 1994, suit was filed. In response to the agreed settlement,
and based upon the Service's current draft guidance relating to petitions for listing category 2 candidate species,
the 90-day finding made on May 6, 1993, is rescinded, and it is replaced by a finding indicating that the petitioners
have presented substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. The Endangered Species Act does
not indicate that designation of critical habitat is a petitionable action, but the Service will consider such designation
in the event that the flatwoods salamander is proposed for listing. A status review of the flatwoods salamander is
currently in progress in connection with the Service's notice of review for animal candidates. Additionally, the
Service hereby announces its formal review of the species' status pursuant to this 90-day petition finding. Public
comments regarding population trends, biological vulnerability and threats to this species should be sent to the
office specified in the

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's rule provides emission standards and test procedures for the certification of new natural gas-fueled, and
liquefied petroleum gas-fueled light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty engines and vehicles, and
motorcycles. The regulations are effective with the 1997 model year, although optional certification prior to the
1997 model year will be available. Today's rule also provides fuel economy test procedures and calculation equations
for natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and trucks, effective upon publication, to allow these vehicles to be
included in a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). Finally, today's rule provides procedures
for the certification of aftermarket conversion equipment to allow a vehicle or engine to operate completely or in
part on a fuel other than the fuel for which it was originally designed and manufactured. 



This action is being taken in order to remove the possibility that the absence of such standards could hinder the development
of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as transportation fuels. These standards are intended to provide a comparable
degree of environmental protection to that afforded by the standards applicable to gasoline, diesel and methanol
vehicles, and to ensure that aftermarket conversions do not degrade the emissions performance of the vehicles or
engines being converted.

I. Introduction 



Recently there has been increasing interest in the use of non-petroleum transportation fuels for a variety of reasons,
including the potential environmental benefits offered by these fuels. Natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) are among the more prominent of these fuels, along with methanol and ethanol. EPA promulgated emission standards
for methanol-fueled vehicles on April 11, 1989 (54 FR 14426) due to the imminent commercialization of those vehicles.
However, there are currently no emission standards in place for vehicles which operate, all or in part, on natural
gas and LPG. This lack of standards is seen as a potential barrier to the widespread commercial introduction of these
vehicles into the marketplace due to the uncertainties the manufacturers face regarding potential future standards
where EPA has not yet addressed any of the issues involved. In addition, the recent rise in interest in these fuels has
resulted in increased interest in aftermarket conversions (

i.e.

, the conversion of a vehicle or engine to operate on a fuel other than that for which it was originally designed and certified
to operate). Again, the lack of defined certification procedures for conversions, as well as the absence of a method
to demonstrate good emissions performance of such conversions, are seen as potential barriers to their more widespread
use for two reasons. First, the lack of defined certification procedures leads to uncertainty among converters as
to whether the conversions they perform constitute tampering and result in the potential associated liability.
Second, the potential for environmental benefits associated with gaseous fuels has led to increased interest in
marketing conversions as an environmental strategy. The lack of a recognized procedure for confirming emissions
performance has been seen as hindering efforts to market conversions in this manner. Thus, in order to remove these
potential barriers EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing emission standards for natural
gas and LPG vehicles, and certification procedures for aftermarket conversions on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52912).


A public hearing was held on December 3, 1992, in Ann Arbor, Michigan at which verbal comments on the NPRM were received.
Written comments responding to the proposal were also received from 34 public and private parties. The Agency fully
considered all comments received in developing today's final rule. 

The remaining sections of this preamble describe EPA's resolution of the issues associated with the rulemaking.
Section II describes today's action and summarizes the new requirements. Section III reviews the major comments
received on the NPRM and the Agency's analysis of those comments. Subsequent sections summarize the technical feasibility,
leadtime requirements, environmental effects, and economic effects associated with today's action. 



II. Description of Action 



This section describes each provision of today's rule. In general, today's rule extends the coverage of the existing
federal motor vehicle emissions program to include natural gas and LPG vehicles (hereinafter referred to as gaseous-fueled
vehicles). As such, EPA's current regulations governing certification, production line, and in-use requirements
are for the most part adopted for gaseous-fueled vehicles. Rather than present an exhaustive review of the entire
federal emissions program, this section contains a basic description of the gaseous-fueled vehicle regulations
and highlights where these regulations differ from those currently in place for other vehicles. For additional information
on the new or existing program requirements the reader is referred to the accompanying regulations appearing at the
end of today's notice, and Title 40, parts 80, 85, 86, 88 and 600 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which this rulemaking
amends. 



A. Timing 



EPA proposed that these standards be effective with the 1994 model year, and explained that the Agency did not expect
that significant lead-time for developing emission control technology would be required for compliance. Nonetheless,
because this rule is not being promulgated until after the start of the 1994 model year, EPA no longer believes that
there is sufficient time to certify vehicles and engines pursuant to these regulations for the 1994 model year. Further,
EPA received several comments stating that leadtime was required for technology development, especially for durability
demonstration, in addition to that required for the certification process alone. Therefore, EPA is promulgating
the standards to be effective with the 1997 model year. Finally, the refueling requirements for gaseous-fueled vehicles
will be implemented consistent with the recently finalized refueling emission standards for other vehicles (three
year phase-in beginning with the 1998 model year for light-duty vehicles and the 2001 model year for light-duty trucks).
 The requirements for refueling stations will take effect on January 1, 1998 for large volume stations, with a two year
delay until January 1, 2000 for those stations which dispense less than 10,000 gallons per month on a gasoline equivalent
basis. This phase in for smaller stations is consistent with the approach taken with the dispensing rate limits placed
on gasoline refueling stations contained in the evaporative emissions final rule.







EPA proposed that manufacturers be allowed to certify engines and vehicles produced prior to the effective model
year in order to include engines in the emissions trading and banking program, and to include vehicles in manufacturers'
corporate average fuel economy. EPA received no adverse comments on this aspect of the proposal. For this reason,
manufacturers may choose to comply prior to the 1997 model year, including the 1994 model year.

Including 1994 model year engines in the emissions trading and 
banking program and raises an issue whether engines manufactured in 
model year 1994 prior to the promulgation of this rule may be 
included in the program. A similar situation was confronted in the 
original banking and trading rule. There, EPA allowed banking for 
the full 1990 model year, even though the rule was promulgated on 
July 26, 1990. 

See

 55 FR 30584, 30587. In that case, EPA placed 
certain restrictions on the inclusion of 1990 model year engines, 
to ensure credits were only given for significant reductions below 
the 1990 standards. This was to ensure that ``windfall'' credits 
from exceeding the arguably ``lax'' pre-1991 standards would not be 
used in the transition to the more stringent 1991 standards. As a 
result, if no restrictions on trading and banking were imposed, 
then the engines that had always exceeded the 1990 standards would 
for the first time be able to use the extra reductions as 
``windfall'' credits to offset engines that did not yet meet the new 
and more stringent 1991 standards. 

See

 55 FR at 30597. 
EPA does not believe such restrictions are necessary in this 
case. Since 1991, engines using other fuels, such as methanol, 
have been able to generate credits to offset higher emitting 
engines. EPA believes that gaseous-fueled engines should have an 
equal opportunity to use such credits as gasoline-, diesel-, and 
methanol-fueled engines, now that emissions standards and test 
procedures are in place in time for the 1994 model year. As EPA 
explained in the response to comments in the trading and banking 
final rule, CNG engines were not included at that time due to the 
absence of standards, test procedures, and certification protocols. 


See id

 at 30609. Now that these rules are in place, there is no 
longer any reason to disadvantage CNG engines vis a vis other 
fuels. 
In addition, EPA does not believe that the credits 
manufacturers might obtain from gaseous-fueled engines are 
``windfall,'' since they arguably would not have manufactured such 
engines in model year 1994 but for EPA's actions to provide an 
incentive to do so. Rather, EPA believes manufacturers had an 
incentive to manufacture gaseous-fueled engines based on EPA 
actions prior to this final rule. EPA proposed these standards in 
November 1992, and began developing these standards substantially 
before that. EPA believes this overall incentive further supports 
allowing manufacturers to include all 1994 model year engines in 
the trading and banking program. 
The aftermarket conversion certification procedures contained 
in today's rule are available to converters as a way of obtaining 
an exemption from the tampering prohibition. Since this procedure 
creates an exemption and is optional it will be available upon 
publication in the 

Federal Register

. EPA's current policy toward 
conversions will continue to apply to aftermarket conversions which 
have not received an exemption under this new program.





The Administrative Procedure Act requires 30 days notice 
before a rule may become effective, except under certain 
circumstances such as when the rule recognizes an exemption or when 
the Agency can demonstrate good cause for immediate effect. The 
Agency believes it has good cause for this rule to take immediate 
effect in the case of the new vehicle standards since compliance 
with the new vehicle standards is optional until well after the 30 
day period. In the case of aftermarket conversions, because this 
rule creates an exemption from the tampering prohibition under 
section 203 of the Act it does not require 30 days notice, and this 
exemption will be available upon publication in the 

Federal 
Register

. 


B. New Vehicle Standards 


The new gaseous-fueled vehicle and engine emission standards 
contained in today's notice are effective with the 1997 model year. 
Optional compliance prior to the 1997 model year is available to 
manufacturers who wish to include their vehicles and engines in 
emissions averaging, trading and banking programs, as well as the 
CAFE program in the case of natural gas-fueled vehicles. 
In general, the Agency seeks to control vehicles operated on 
alternative fuels so that their emissions are no greater than their 
petroleum-fueled counterparts. Thus, the exhaust emission 
standards for gaseous-fueled vehicles are numerically equivalent to 
those which apply to other, currently regulated vehicles and 
engines. The only significant departure from this approach is in 
the area of hydrocarbon (HC) standards for natural gas fueled 
vehicles and engines. Prior to the 1994 model year, regulated 
vehicles (

i.e.

, gasoline, petroleum diesel and methanol) are only 
required to meet total hydrocarbon (THC) standards. However, 
beginning with the 1994 model year, currently regulated light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks will also be required to meet 
separate nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) standards as part of the 
Tier 1 requirements of the Clean Air Act.
 For natural gas-fueled 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks only the NMHC standards 
will apply. In the case of natural gas-fueled heavy-duty engines, 
NMHC standards which provide the same degree of NMHC control as the 
current THC standards provide for petroleum-fueled vehicles will 
apply. In the case of LPG vehicles and engines, the HC standards 
are the same as those for currently regulated vehicles. A summary 
of today's gaseous-fueled vehicle emission standards is contained 
in Tables 1 through 4.

For the purposes of these standards, the current scheme of 
classifying vehicles as either Otto-cycle or diesel is being 
extended to gaseous-fueled vehicles, with some modifications as 
described below. This classification scheme was promulgated with 
the methanol standards to group engines regardless of fuel type in 
a manner that would provide equivalent control.

Although there are other factors to consider, in general an 
Otto-cycle engine is considered to be one that is throttled during 
normal operation whereas a diesel is not. The Agency recognizes, 
however, that in some cases this criterion may not be adequate or 
appropriate to determine a vehicle's classification. For example, 
a gaseous-fueled engine which is derived from a particular 
Otto-cycle or diesel base engine, and is expected to be used in 
similar applications as the base engine, would most appropriately 
be classified the same as the base engine from which it was 
derived. In such cases the Administrator will take into account 
other relevant factors, such as compression ratio, combustion and 
thermodynamic characteristics, or intended in-use duty cycle when 
classifying the vehicle.

Today's rule establishes the same evaporative emission 
requirements for gaseous-fueled vehicles which were recently 
adopted for other vehicles.
 The Agency recognizes that due to the 
sealed nature of gaseous-fueled vehicle fuel systems, emissions of 
unburned fuel from the fuel system are expected to be near-zero. 
However, the evaporative requirements are being adopted to assure 
leak-free fuel systems. 





Today's rule establishes refueling requirements for gaseous-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks,
as well as 
refueling stations. Natural gas-fueled vehicles must be equipped 
with a refueling receptacle which meets the requirements of the 
recently adopted ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard for refueling couplings. 
Natural gas refueling stations will not be allowed to vent more 
than 1.2 grams natural gas due to refueling nozzle disconnect. The 
applicable dates for these standards are discussed in the timing 
section of today's rule.

For LPG vehicles there are two requirements. First, all LPG 
vehicle refueling stations will be required to use nozzles which 
have very low dead volume (2.0 cm3) from which fuel would be vented 
upon nozzle disconnect. This requirement was derived from the 
recently promulgated onboard refueling vapor recovery standard. 
For a complete description of the derivation please consult the 
summary and analysis of comments document. Second, LPG-fueled 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks will be subject to the 
onboard refueling emission standards, adjusted for the difference 
in LPG energy density as compared to gasoline. This adjusted 
standard is 0.15 grams per gallon of LPG dispensed. The applicable 
dates for these standards are discussed in the timing section of 
today's rule. Additionally, for any LPG vehicle that contains a 
fixed liquid level valve (i.e., ``outage valve''), the refueling test 
will be performed with the liquid level valve in the open position 
unless the manufacturer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that the fixed liquid level gauge would not be 
opened during refueling in ordinary use due to inaccessibility or 
other reasons. 

EPA recognizes that, although it did propose the control of 
refueling emissions from gaseous-fueled vehicles, the proposal did 
not include specific numerical standards as contained in today's 
rule. However, EPA believes that this action will be 
noncontroversial, and the Agency anticipates no significant 
comments regarding it.

Nonetheless, the public is advised that these elements of 
today's action dealing with refueling emissions will be effective 
60 days from the date of this 

Federal Register

 notice, unless 
notice is received within 30 days that interested parties wish to 
submit adverse or critical comments on that element of this action. 
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two 
subsequent notices will be published. One notice, which would be 
published before the effective date, will withdraw the final 
action. Another notice will begin a new rulemaking by announcing 
a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. 

There is reason to believe that, in the case of some of the 
above-mentioned pollutants and vehicle classes, the levels of 
emissions will normally be substantially below the levels of the 
applicable standards. In such cases today's rule includes 
provisions for a waiver of certification testing requirements which 
allow a manufacturer to certify the vehicle or engine without 
performing the actual certification testing for which a waiver has 
been granted, similar to the waivers available for heavy-duty 
diesel engine CO, methanol vehicle and engine smoke and 
particulate, and Otto-cycle light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck 
particulate standards.
 A certification testing waiver can be 
obtained by demonstrating that, by virtue of a vehicle's design, it 
will always meet the standard for which the waiver was granted. 
This demonstration can be in the form of development testing data 
or other engineering data. It should be noted that these waivers 
only apply to certification testing requirements and do not relieve 
the manufacturer of liability for meeting the standard. Vehicles 
which have been certified using these waiver provisions also remain 
subject to selective enforcement audit (SEA) and in-use testing. 
The waivers provided in today's rule are available for all gaseous-fueled vehicle evaporative and refueling standards,
gaseous-fueled 
heavy-duty diesel CO (including idle CO), particulate and smoke 
standards, and particulate standards for light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks.

Today's rule allows gaseous-fueled vehicles to demonstrate compliance with emission standards through averaging,
trading and banking in the same manner as vehicles operated on other fuels. Gaseous-fueled vehicles will be treated
similarly to methanol-fueled vehicles with respect to the constraints of the various programs. For a more detailed
discussion of how gaseous-fueled vehicles fit into these programs please consult the public docket for this rulemaking.
 As explained above, in addition to new vehicles and engines, today's rule allows manufacturers to include in the averaging,
trading and banking programs 1994 model year vehicles and engines manufactured before the rule's effective date,
but identical to 1994 model year vehicles and engines manufactured after the effective date. 





Today's rule delays the applicability of federal on-board diagnostics (OBD) requirements for natural gas-fueled
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks until the 1998 model year. As finalized in the February 19, 1993 OBD rule
 those requirements were scheduled to take effect with the 1994 model year for all vehicles for which emission standards
exist. However, due to the feasibility issues unique to natural gas-fueled vehicles, these requirements are being
delayed until the 1998 model year. OBD I requirements will apply to natural gas vehicles in the 1997 model year, as well
as those natural gas vehicles optionally certified prior to the 1997 model year. The OBD requirements contained in
the OBD rule will apply to liquefied petroleum gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks beginning with
optionally 
certified vehicles in the 1994 model year. 





C. Certification Test Fuel Specification 



The certification test fuels in today's rule are intended to represent the actual fuels gaseous-fueled vehicles
are likely to see in-use. Given the wide range of in-use fuel compositions, the certification fuels are broadly defined.
In the case of natural gas, the certification fuel specifications include a minimum methane content of 89 percent,
as well as maximum levels for the other prominent hydrocarbons found in natural gas (

e.g.,

 ethane, propane). Certification fuel under this approach reflects over 90 percent of the natural gas available in
the United States. Most of the gas not meeting this criteria is gas being sold in high altitude areas, where higher levels
of inert gases are added to the natural gas. 

Significantly less is known about the variability of in-use LPG composition. However, the Agency believes that the
composition of LPG is more consistent than that of natural gas due to common carrier pipeline and import tariff constraints.
Thus, the Agency is adopting commercially available LPG as the certification fuel for LPG vehicles. As more information
becomes available on LPG composition, and as experience with LPG vehicles increases, the need for a more well-defined
LPG certification fuel may become apparent. Should this happen, EPA would take steps at that time to develop an appropriate
LPG certification fuel specification. It should be noted that the Agency is not including any controls on in-use natural
gas or LPG in today's rule, but intends to monitor in-use fuels to ensure that the certification fuels remain 
representative. 



D. Test Procedures 



For the most part, the current test cycles, and measurement and analytical procedures can be directly applied to gaseous-fueled
vehicles. Thus, the test procedures contained in today's rule are largely the same as those which apply to other, currently
regulated vehicles. The only exception of note is the procedure for measuring NMHC emissions from natural gas-fueled
vehicles. The 
current procedure for measuring NMHC emissions was adopted in the Tier 1 rule.
 While this procedure works fairly well for currently regulated vehicles, it is not nearly as accurate for natural
gas-fueled vehicles due to their much higher levels of exhaust methane. Thus, today's rule contains some slight modifications
to the NMHC test procedures adopted for the Tier 1 standards
 to allow more accurate NMHC measurement from natural gas-fueled vehicles. These changes include accounting for
the different flame ionization detector (FID) response to methane as opposed to the other hydrocarbons, as well as
the use of fuel densities and H/C ratios in the calculations which are more appropriate to natural gas vehicles. The
Agency views this as an interim measure and is currently working with the California Air Resources Board and the American
Automobile Manufacturers Association as part of a cooperative research and development agreement to develop a more

accurate procedure for the direct measurement of NMHC.

E. Fuel Economy 



Today's rule contains fuel economy test procedures and calculations for measuring the fuel economy of natural gas-fueled
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The driving cycles adopted for natural gas vehicles are the same as those
currently in place for gasoline-fueled vehicles. Also, the measurement and calculation procedures for natural
gas vehicles rely on the same principle of carbon balance as the current gasoline procedures, but include a gasoline/natural
gas equivalency factor of 100 standard cubic feet of natural gas equalling 0.823 gallons of gasoline. 

These procedures and calculations will allow these vehicles to be included in a manufacturer's corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C.  2001 

et seq.

 The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988,
 provides that alternative fueled vehicles (including natural gas-fueled vehicles) may be included in a manufacturer's
CAFE calculation on a favorable basis in order to encourage the manufacture of such vehicles. The AMFA provides that,
for purposes of including natural gas vehicles in the CAFE calculation, fuel consumption of natural gas vehicles
is only fifteen percent of equivalent gasoline fuel consumption. The AMFA also mandates the 0.823 gasoline/natural
gas equivalency factor included in today's rule. Regulations governing the calculation and use of natural gas vehicle
CAFE credits are contained in a separate rulemaking action.
 





As will be discussed further in the Public Participation section of this rule, the Agency is not promulgating fuel
economy procedures for LPG vehicles today, but will do so in a separate rulemaking action.





F. Aftermarket Conversions 



Today's rule contains provisions for the certification of aftermarket conversions (

i.e.,

 conversions which allow a vehicle or engine to operate on a fuel other than the fuel for which it was originally designed
and certified). An exemption from the tampering prohibitions contained in section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act
can be secured through this certification process. The provisions contained in today's rule for securing such an
exemption consist of three main parts: applicable standards, test procedures, and warranty/liability issues.


It has always been the Agency's policy that an aftermarket conversion not degrade the emissions performance of the
original vehicle as a condition of being exempt from prosecution for tampering violations. Today's rule merely clarifies
that policy by providing specific procedures by which one can certify that a conversion does meet this requirement,
and thus secure an exemption from the tampering prohibition. Consistent with this policy, the emission standards
which an aftermarket conversion shall meet in order to secure the tampering prohibition exemption are essentially
the same standards the original vehicle was certified as meeting. In the case of conversions to natural gas, the converted
vehicle would not be required to meet the THC standard, but must meet an NMHC standard which provides an equivalent
amount of NMHC control as that afforded by the original THC standard. In the case of conversion to multi-fuel operation
(i.e., where the vehicle has the ability to switch between two fuels, such as gasoline and natural gas, or where the
vehicle operates on two fuels simultaneously, but retains the ability to operate exclusively on the original fuel),
the vehicle would still be required to meet the emission standards it was originally certified to when operating on
the original fuel, in addition to meeting the applicable requirements on the new fuel. 

The test procedures applicable to aftermarket conversions under this program are those currently in place new vehicle
certification as outlined in 40 CFR Part 86. The small volume manufacturers certification program contained in 40
CFR 86.092-14 is also available for aftermarket conversion certification provided the company or individual
seeking certification meets the sales limits described in that section. These procedures utilize the same test cycles
and analytical procedures that are used for new vehicle certification. In the case of aftermarket conversions a certificate
of conformity must be sought for each engine family/conversion system combination and for each model year vehicle
for which the system is intended. 

As a condition of exemption from the tampering prohibition, conversion manufacturers and installers must accept
in-use liability for warranty and recall as outlined in section 207 of the Act and its implementing regulations.
 This is consistent with EPA's policy that aftermarket conversions not degrade the emissions performance of the original
vehicle. It will also assure that the conversion will meet the applicable emission standards throughout its useful
life. Since conversions generally rely, at least in part, on emission control equipment already on the original vehicle
for emissions control, the useful life of a conversion will not extend beyond the useful life of the original vehicle.

G. Fees 



Under section 217 of the Clean Air Act, EPA may establish fees 
to recover all reasonable costs incurred for activities associated 
with the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program (MVECP). The 
MVECP includes all compliance and enforcement activities performed 
by EPA which are associated with certification, fuel economy, 
Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA), and in-use compliance 
activities. In July of 1992 EPA established these fees, to be 
effective with the 1993 model year.
 These fees, as stated in the 
fees rule, cover all direct and indirect costs incurred by EPA for 
the MVECP, and automatically apply to gaseous-fueled vehicles and 
engines now that the MVECP applies to such vehicles and engines. 
Since the fees are based on the costs incurred by EPA, and since 
today's regulations are basically an extension of the current 
MVECP, the fees currently in effect for other vehicles apply to 
gaseous-fueled vehicles, without modification. No regulatory 
changes are needed and none are being made. The applicable fee 
must be paid, for each engine family, before the Certification 
Division can begin a review of the application for certification. 





III. Public Participation 



A number of interested parties commented on EPA's November 5, 
1992 NPRM. The comments include written submittals to the 
rulemaking docket and those presented at the December 3, 1992 
public hearing, which was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Agency 
has fully considered these comments in developing today's final 
rule. 

This section describes the major issues of the rulemaking, as 
reflected in the public comments. The discussion of each issue 
opens with a brief description of what was proposed followed by a 
summary of the significant comments and EPA's analysis of the 
issue. The reader is referred to the Summary and Analysis of 
Comments document for the complete details of EPA's analysis. That 
document is available in the rulemaking docket. (For information 
on access to the docket, see the ``

Addresses

'' section above.) 



A. Timing of Requirements 





Summary of the proposal:

 As was stated in the NPRM, the Agency 
believes that the proposed standards are not technology-forcing, 
and that they could be met largely through currently available 
technology. Thus, the only leadtime requirement for meeting the 
proposed standards would be that of actually going through the 
certification process itself, including the required durability 
showing. The Agency, therefore, proposed that the new vehicle 
emission standards be effective with the 1994 model year, and that 
the aftermarket conversions take effect on January 1, 1994. 
Additionally, the Agency proposed that manufacturers have the 
option of complying with these standards prior to the effective 
date in order to participate in any applicable emissions averaging, 
trading and banking programs, as well as the CAFE program in the 
case of natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty 
trucks. 



Summary of the comments:

 In general, the comments received in 
response to the issue of leadtime supported EPA's assessment that 
these standards are not technology-forcing in the sense that 
fundamentally new technology must be developed. However, a number 
of commenters raised concerns that, although the basic technology 
required to meet these standards has been demonstrated at low 
mileage, the durability of this technology in many cases remains to 
be proven. Additionally, one commenter pointed out that there are 
several mandated requirements taking effect in the next few years 
for new vehicles, including Tier 1 and cold CO standards, on-board 
diagnostics, and revised evaporative procedures, and that mandating 
gaseous-fueled vehicle certification with little leadtime may 
seriously impair the introduction of these vehicles into the 
marketplace. Most commenters suggested that, given the need for 
technology refinement and durability work, these requirements 
should not take effect until the 1996 or 1997 model year. In 
addition, the heavy-duty engine manufacturers asserted that, under 
section 202(a)(3)(C) of the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to 
provide four years leadtime in the case of any new emission 
standards. In most cases commenters stated that, regardless of 
what effective date EPA finalizes, they support the option of being 
able to certify prior to the effective date.

<TEXT>
 



EPA response to comments:

 The Agency agrees that, while current 
gaseous-fueled vehicle technology is generally capable of meeting 
the emission standards contained in today's rule, work remains in 
some cases to meet the durability requirements. While the Agency 
believes that some current gaseous-fueled engine technologies are 
capable of demonstrating the required emissions durability, it does 
not believe this is the case with some of the newest technologies 
being developed. Given that each engine family must demonstrate 
durability during the new vehicle certification process, the Agency 
believes that not providing adequate leadtime may hinder the 
further development of new gaseous-fueled vehicle technology in the 
short term, which is contrary to the stated intent of this rule. 
Thus, today's requirements for new vehicles and engines will take 
effect with the 1997 model year as requested by some commenters. 
Manufacturers will have the option to comply with these provisions 
prior to the 1997 model year if they choose. 

The Agency does not believe that this amount of leadtime will 
be a problem from an environmental standpoint for two reasons. 
First, the volume of new gaseous-fueled vehicles produced prior to 
the 1997 model year is not expected to be that large, given the 
relatively young nature of the new gaseous-fueled vehicle market. 
Second, the Agency expects that any new vehicle or engine family 
which might be sold in any significant volume prior to the 1997 
model year would have demonstrated adequate durability. Since 
there is much incentive for early compliance in the form of CAFE 
credits and the emissions banking and trading program, the Agency 
would expect the manufacturers of these vehicles to certify them in 
order to take advantage of these credits. 

Additionally, the Agency does not believe that it is required 
to provide four years leadtime for new gaseous-fueled heavy-duty 
engine standards because these standards are being promulgated 
under the general authority of section 202(a)(1). However, as will 
be discussed in the section on CO and crankcase emissions, the 
Agency has elected to provide four years of leadtime in the case of 
crankcase emission controls. For further discussion of the four 
year leadtime issue please consult the summary and analysis of 
comments document in the docket. Finally, manufacturers have the 
option of complying with these requirements prior to their 
effective date (including certification retroactive to the 
beginning of the 1994 model year) and can include such certified 
engines in the averaging, banking and trading program. 



B. Standards for HC 



1. NMHC vs. THC Standards 





Summary of the proposal:

 Since natural gas is primarily methane, 
natural gas-fueled vehicles (NGV) tend to have fairly high levels 
of methane emissions in their exhaust HC. Due to the difficulty 
current catalyst formulations have in oxidizing methane, it is not 
currently feasible for NGVs to meet the same THC standards that 
other vehicles meet. Thus, only NMHC standards were proposed for 
NGVs, with the Agency deferring any action on THC standards for 
NGVs until such time as the necessary methane control technology 
can be developed. LPG fuel, however, contains no methane, and the 
exhaust methane levels associated with LPG vehicles tend to be much 
closer to those from petroleum-fueled vehicles. Thus, all 
applicable THC and NMHC standards were proposed for LPG vehicles. 



Summary of the comments:

 The Agency's decision to defer action on 
THC standards for NGVs received very broad support. Only the 
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) disagreed 
with this approach. MECA contended that without some form of 
technology-forcing THC standard for NGVs, most work on methane 
control technology would likely stop. MECA also pointed out that 
the Agency has, in the past, used technology-forcing standards as 
impetus for the development of new emission control technology. 

Several commenters suggested that the approach of exempting 
NGVs from THC standards should be applied to LPG vehicles as well, 
citing a potential unfair advantage for NGVs if LPG vehicles were 
required to meet THC standards. Additionally, the LP Gas Clean 
Fuels Coalition stated that LPG vehicles have substantially higher 
levels of methane emissions than their petroleum-fueled 
counterparts, and thus should also be exempt from meeting the THC 
standards. The Coalition, however, did not submit any data in 
support of this claim. 



EPA response to the comments:

 The Agency continues to believe that 
action on the THC standards for NGVs should be deferred. The 
Agency continues to be concerned that compliance with the THC 
standard currently in place for other fuels is infeasible for NGVs. 
While the Agency has received data suggesting that the THC 
standards are technically achievable for NGVs, no data has been 
submitted concerning the cost of refining and implementing the 
necessary technology on a commercial level. Cost is a component of 
feasibility, and without cost information the Agency cannot 
conclude that compliance with the THC standards is feasible. 
Moreover, technical issues remain to be resolved. The data 
suggesting that THC standards are technically achievable was 
limited to vehicles operating at a stoichiometric fuel/air ratio, 
and operation under other conditions (

i.e.,

 lean burn) remains an 
issue. Additionally, the durability of methane-specific catalysts 
remains an unknown. 

Also, for the reasons explained in the proposal, EPA does not 
believe it can establish a technology-forcing standard. EPA 
continues to believe that the amount of lead-time required for 
adequate technology development still cannot be readily determined, 
because the durability of a methane catalyst formulation has not 
been established. EPA does not agree that the absence of a 
technology-forcing standard would bring work on methane control 
technology to a stop. The engine manufacturing industry has 
indicated that its research will continue based on the belief that 
THC standards will be imposed in the future. Also, as noted in the 
proposal, EPA believes that strong growth in the NGV market in the 
near-term is important to provide resources for technology 
development. Of course, EPA will continue to monitor work on 
methane catalyst development. If information becomes available 
establishing the technology's feasibility (including cost 
information), EPA will consider adopting THC standards for NGVs. 
Also, if future events further demonstrate the need for a 
technology-forcing standard, EPA will further consider this option 
as well. 

As was stated in the NPRM, the Agency believes it most 
appropriate to, wherever possible, apply the same standards to 
alternative-fueled vehicles that apply to their petroleum-fueled 
counterparts. In the case of NGVs there are circumstances, as 
discussed above, which justify deviating from this basic 
philosophy. However, the Agency has seen no emissions data which 
would suggest that a similar set of circumstances exists for LPG 
vehicles. Thus, LPG vehicles will be required to meet the same THC 
standards as currently apply to other vehicles.

2. Heavy-Duty NMHC Standards 





Summary of the proposal: 

In setting NMHC standards for natural 
gas-fueled heavy-duty engines (HDE), the Agency intends to 
establish standards which would provide the same level of NMHC 
control as the THC standards in effect for petroleum diesel and 
gasoline HDEs. In the absence of speciated exhaust HC data on HDEs 
(i.e., data on the level of the individual HC components in the 
exhaust), EPA applied the results of an analysis done on light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks to arrive at NMHC standards which 
were 82.5 percent of the level of the corresponding THC standards. 
The resultant standards were very close to those adopted by the 
California Air Resources Board (CARB), and in the NPRM the Agency 
requested comment on whether it should adopt CARB's standards 
instead. 



Summary of the comments: 

Every commenter who expressed an opinion 
on this issue urged EPA to adopt the CARB standards in order that 
the California and federal standards be harmonized. 



EPA response to the comments: 

The Agency believes that the 
differences between its proposed NMHC standards and CARB's are so 
small as not to be an air quality issue. Further, EPA has learned 
since the NPRM that the CARB standards were based on speciated data 
from HDEs. Thus, as EPA believes that the speciated data provides 
a sounder basis than EPA's, the Agency is adopting CARB's NMHC 
standards for HDEs. 



3. Evaporative Emission Standards 





Summary of the proposal: 

In the NPRM it was noted that, due to the 
sealed nature of gaseous-fueled vehicle fuel systems, their 
``evaporative'' emissions (i.e., emissions of unburned fuel from the 
fuel storage system) are expected to be near-zero. Nonetheless, 
the Agency proposed evaporative emission controls for gaseous- 
fueled vehicles in order to assure that the fuel systems are not 
leaking. EPA proposed that the evaporative provisions for gasoline 
and methanol-fueled vehicles, which were in the process of being 
revised at the time of the proposal for this rule, be applicable to 
gaseous-fueled vehicles as well, with modifications to the test 
procedures as necessary to accommodate gaseous fuels. The Agency 
also proposed that certification testing waivers be available for 
evaporative testing in order to reduce the testing burden as much 
as possible, given the likelihood of near-zero emissions. 



Summary of the comments: 

Although one commenter supported the 
proposed evaporative requirements for gaseous-fueled vehicles, 
citing potential fuel leaks from the vehicle refueling receptacle, 
most of the comments received expressed opposition. In general, 
most commenters said that, for safety reasons, as well as to simply 
prevent the complete escape of fuel from the vehicle for economic 
reasons, the fuel systems must be sealed. Since sealed systems are 
a practical requirement of gaseous-fueled vehicles, they argued, 
there is no need for EPA to regulate evaporative emissions. As a 
result, any certification testing required would be unnecessary. 
Some commenters felt that if EPA were to require some form of 
evaporative emissions showing that it should be in the form of an 
engineering evaluation of the system, or simply a one hour diurnal 
test. 



EPA response to comments: 

The Agency agrees with the general 
comment that there are practical considerations other than 
emissions concerns which force the use of sealed fuel systems on 
gaseous-fueled vehicles. As a result, EPA would expect their 
evaporative emissions to be near-zero. However, the Agency 
believes that it is prudent to have some kind of evaporative 
emission standard which can be enforced, in order to assure that 
fuel system leaks do not become a problem. Thus, the same new 
evaporative provisions applicable to other vehicles beginning with 
the 1996 model year will also be applied to gaseous-fueled vehicles 
at that time, recognizing that compliance with these standards is 
optional prior to the 1997 model year. The Agency does recognize, 
however, that it is likely that, by virtue of their design, 
gaseous-fueled vehicles will emit well below the applicable 
standards. Therefore, certification testing waivers will be 
available for all gaseous-fueled vehicle evaporative provisions if 
the manufacturer can show that, by virtue of the vehicle's design, 
it will always meet the applicable standards.

C. Refueling Emission Standards 



1. Natural Gas 





Summary of the proposal: 

In the NPRM the Agency proposed that, in 
the case of natural gas refueling facilities, no refueling hoses 
which need to be vented down prior to disconnect shall be vented to 
the atmosphere. Rather, as is the case with many current natural 
gas refueling facilities, EPA expects that such vent-down gases 
should be routed back to the compressor inlet rather than being 
vented to the atmosphere. The timing of this requirement was not 
explicit in the NPRM preamble. However, the regulatory text stated 
that the provisions would take effect with the 1994 model year. 



Summary of the comments: 

In general, the comments received in 
response to the issue of natural gas refueling hose venting 
opposed, to some degree, the proposed prohibition on venting 
emissions. Some commenters suggested that this requirement is not 
needed at all given the extremely small contribution to total 
methane emissions that vent-down gases represent. Several 
commenters pointed out that the upcoming ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard 
would address EPA's concerns about refueling emissions from natural 
gas refueling stations. One commenter pointed out that this 
proposed requirement could be interpreted as a zero-emission 
standard and questioned the feasibility of such an approach. Some 
commenters suggested that more leadtime was needed than was 
proposed. Several commenters pointed out that the cost of 
controlling these emissions varied quite a bit depending on the 
inlet pressure of the compressor. In cases where the natural gas 
supply line is at fairly low pressure (

i.e., 

15 psi or less) the 
gas could be routed directly into the compressor inlet at low cost. 
However, in cases where the gas supply pressure is higher, 
additional compression equipment would be needed to compress the 
vent-down gas in order to route it back into the compressor, 
raising costs substantially. Also, the cost of such controls would 
be much higher for existing installations than for new stations 
because existing stations would likely require excavation for the 
return line plumbing. Finally, some commenters stated that EPA 
should not control natural gas refueling emissions since they are 
primarily methane, and the Agency only proposed NMHC standards for 
tailpipe emissions. 



EPA response to comments: 

In the NPRM the Agency mentioned that 
the natural gas industry was moving toward the establishment of 
standard refueling equipment specifications. That effort, known as 
the ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard, was recently adopted by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) as the standard for natural gas 
vehicle fueling connection devices. While in its various draft 
forms, this standard contained a provision limiting the amount of 
natural gas that can be vented due to nozzle disconnect. This 
provision was based on the proposed onboard refueling vapor 
recovery (ORVR) standard for gasoline-fueled vehicles of 0.05 grams 
per gallon of dispensed gasoline.
 As indicated in the draft ANSI 
standard contained in the public docket for this rule, the venting 
provision was deleted from the final ANSI standard since, at the 
time of final balloting on the standard, the ORVR rule had not yet 
been promulgated. The ORVR final rule was recently promulgated and 
included a gasoline-fueled vehicle refueling emission standard of 
0.20 grams per gallon of dispensed gasoline.







The Agency agrees that a zero-emission standard for natural 
gas vehicles is not reasonable and believes that, in its draft 
form, the NGV1 standard addressed EPA's concerns with natural gas 
vehicle refueling emissions. Thus, the Agency is using the 
methodology in draft NGV1 standard to apply the 0.20 gram per 
gallon refueling standard to natural gas vehicles. Using this 
approach, natural gas refueling stations will be allowed to vent no 
more than 1.2 grams of natural gas due to nozzle disconnect. This 
standard is based on the ORVR standard of 0.20 grams per gallon of 
fuel dispensed and a nominal fuel tank capacity of six gallons 
gasoline equivalent natural gas, as was assumed in the draft NGV1 
standard. For a more complete discussion of how this standard was 
derived please consult the summary and analysis of comments 
document for this rule. This requirement will take effect January 
1, 1998 for high volume stations, with a two year extension until 
January 1, 2000 for small volume stations (those which dispense 
less than the energy equivalent of 10,000 gallons of gasoline per 
month based on the AMFA fuel equivalency factor).

<PARENT> FR940921-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to the requirements for natural gas refueling 
stations, EPA is also requiring in today's rule natural gas-fueled 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks be equipped with 
refueling receptacles which comply with the recently adopted 
ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard. This requirement will be implemented 
consistent with the timing of the ORVR provisions for other 
vehicles (three year phase-in beginning with the 1998 model year 
for light-duty vehicles and the 2001 model year for light-duty 
trucks). The Agency expects, however, that all new natural gas- 
fueled vehicles will have ANSI/AGA NGV1 nozzles long before this 
due to the desire for standardized refueling coupling geometry 
within the industry. 
EPA does not believe that the cost of the refueling station 
controls is prohibitive and believes that today's requirement is 
both feasible and reasonable. Consistent with this view, most new 
stations being installed would meet this requirement. The Agency 
agrees that in certain cases, such as those where additional 
compression equipment is needed, the cost of retrofitting may not 
be reasonable. Thus, for in-use refueling stations which must be 
retrofitted to meet this requirement, the Agency will waive the 
requirement in situations where the station operator can 
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that 
compliance with this provision would require the use of additional 
compression equipment, or other similar costs. The impact of such 
waivers should be minimal given the small number of stations 
currently operating, and the small percentage of those stations 
which would not currently meet these requirements. 
As was discussed earlier, the lack of exhaust THC standards 
in today's rule is a function of cost and legal constraints, and 
the Agency believes that control of methane is appropriate where it 
is feasible and economically reasonable. Thus, EPA does not 
believe that the desire to control refueling emissions from natural 
gas vehicles is inconsistent with the adoption of exhaust NMHC 
standards. 


2. LPG Vehicle/Pump Interface 




Summary of the proposal: 

Since LPG is transferred in a sealed 
system there is little concern about refueling emissions at the 
vehicle/pump interface during the actual fuel transfer. Of concern 
to the Agency, however, are emissions released when the nozzle is 
disconnected from the vehicle. At this point any fuel which is 
trapped in the dead space between the nozzle and the vehicle 
receptacle is released. In the NPRM the Agency proposed that 
refueling equipment be designed so as to prevent this escape of 
fuel, such as through the use of low-loss, no-bleed couplings, 
although no specific numerical standards were included. As with 
the natural gas provisions in the NPRM, the timing of this 
requirement was not explicit in the NPRM preamble. However, the 
regulatory text stated that the provisions would take effect with 
the 1994 model year. 


Summary of the comments: 

The Agency received few comments on this 
particular aspect of the proposed refueling provisions. The 
comments that addressed this issue tended to agree with the need 
for control. However, the comments otherwise differed. One 
commenter suggested that any hardware requirement be performance-based, rather than prescriptive, so as to be consistent
with EPA's 
previous consideration of refueling controls for gasoline vehicles. 
Also, the lack of a numerical standard was interpreted as being a 
zero-emission standard, which one commenter suggested is 
infeasible. Another commenter stated that just requiring new 
refueling nozzles at all current LPG fueling facilities would cost 
about $30 million, but provided no supporting documentation for 
that claim. 


EPA response to comments: 

The Agency believes that it is 
appropriate to minimize the amount of LPG fuel which is vented from 
the dead space between the refueling nozzle check valve and the 
vehicle refueling receptacle check valve but also agrees that a 
zero-emission standard is unreasonable. Both the nozzle and the 
vehicle receptacle geometries play an integral role in the size of 
this dead space. Thus, any performance specification for 
vehicle/pump interface refueling emissions would have to address 
the nozzle and receptacle as a single system. In the case of LPG, 
there is not a standardized geometry for refueling nozzles, at 
least in terms of the parameters which would affect this dead 
space. Thus, it is difficult for the Agency to define a 
performance specification such as that which has been considered 
for gasoline vehicles based upon an industry standard nozzle 
geometry. The Agency is aware that the LPG industry is developing 
nozzles which dramatically reduce the dead space, especially when 
used in conjunction with low-bleed inserts in the vehicle 
receptacle.

For the reasons just mentioned EPA is finalizing a two-fold 
approach to refueling emissions for LPG vehicles. First, today's 
rule includes a requirement that LPG refueling nozzles have no more 
than 2.0 cm

3

 dead space, as measured from the face of the nozzle 
which seals against the vehicle receptacle ``O'' ring. Second, a 
refueling standard and SHED-based test consistent with the recently 
promulgated ORVR requirement is being adopted for LPG-fueled light 
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The vehicle standard, 
adjusted for the difference in energy density between gasoline and 
LPG, is 0.15 grams per dispensed gallon of fuel. This approach 
will ensure that the LPG vehicles will have refueling emissions 
similar to those of other vehicles meeting the ORVR standards. A 
certification testing waiver will be available for all classes of 
LPG vehicles to which this standard applies if the manufacturer can 
demonstrate, through the use of development or other data, that the 
vehicle will meet the standard. For a complete discussion of how 
the 2.0 cm

3

 standard for LPG vehicle refueling nozzles was derived 
please consult the summary and analysis of comments document for 
this rule. 
This standard for LPG vehicles will apply to the same classes 
and model years as the ORVR rule (i.e., three year phase-in 
beginning with the 1998 model year for light-duty vehicles and the 
2001 model year for light-duty trucks). The requirement for the 
refueling nozzles will take effect January 1, 1998 for high volume 
stations, with a two year extension until January 1, 2000 for small 
volume stations (those which dispense less than the energy 
equivalent of 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month). The Agency 
believes that this amount of leadtime for refueling stations will 
allow for the replacement or retrofit of LPG nozzles during the 
normal course of replacement or repair of in-use nozzles due to 
wear. 


3. LPG Tank Venting 




Summary of the proposal: 

Fuel tanks for LPG vehicles currently 
have a device known as a fixed liquid level valve, or outage valve, 
at the proper fill level. This is a small orifice which can be 
opened during refueling in order to indicate that, upon the release 
of liquid from the valve, the tank is filled and refueling should 
stop. Although LPG tanks are now constructed with built-in 
automatic shutoff devices to prevent overfilling, they still have 
outage valves on them. The Agency proposed a prohibition on all 
non-safety-related valves on gaseous-fueled vehicles in order to 
prevent the emissions of LPG from outage valves during refueling. 


Summary of the comments: 

The Agency received a variety of comments 
expressing concern about the proposal to eliminate outage valves 
from LPG vehicles. First, several commenters pointed out that 
outage valves are required under the National Fire Protection 
Association standard 58 (NFPA 58), and that the NFPA code has been 
adopted by many state and local fire marshals as the applicable 
fire code. Second, some commenters stated that the regulatory 
language as proposed precluded the use of all types of valves on 
gaseous-fueled vehicles, including such things as manual fuel 
shutoff valves. Third, some comments were received expressing 
concern that this requirement would preclude the use of liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) altogether due to the need to occasionally vent 
excess pressure from LNG fuel tanks to prevent overpressurization. 
Finally, one commenter expressed concern about the application of 
this requirement to LPG vehicles already in service and the 
possibility of having to retrofit those vehicles. 


EPA response to comments: 

The Agency understands the apparent 
conflict between its proposal and the requirements of NFPA 58. EPA 
believes that with the newer requirement in NFPA 58 for automatic 
shutoff (overfill prevention) mechanisms, the requirement for 
outage valves on vehicle fuel tanks is obsolete, and should be 
removed from NFPA 58. Due to this conflict, however, the Agency 
has chosen not to finalize its proposed requirements prohibiting 
outage valves, but is working with the industry and NFPA to have 
this requirement deleted from NFPA. While the Agency believes it 
has the authority to preempt NFPA 58 as adopted by fire marshals 
through the adoption of the proposed requirement to eliminate 
outage valves, it prefers to work with the industry to remove that 
requirement from NFPA 58 before superseding state and local law 
through EPA regulation. Given that the proposed language 
prohibiting non-safety-related valves is not being finalized, the 
other concerns expressed in the comments are alleviated. 

While the Agency is not finalizing the proposed requirements 
concerning outage valves, they remain a concern as a source of 
emissions. This is especially true for LPG vehicles which are 
intended to be certified as ILEVs. Thus, for any LPG vehicle, the 
above-mentioned refueling test procedure will be performed with the 
outage valve opened, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate, to 
the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the outage valve or any 
other such gauges or valves would not be opened during refueling 
in-use due to inaccessibility or other design features that would 
prevent or make it very unlikely that they could be opened. 



D. Standards for CO and Crankcase Emissions

1. Idle CO 




Summary of the proposal: 

Until the methanol emission standards were promulgated in 1989, idle CO standards were only applied to Otto-cycle
engines. EPA reasoned that diesel vehicles always operate at such lean fuel/air ratios that their idle CO emissions
would always be well below the standards. The methanol rule applied idle CO standards to all methanol-fueled vehicles
because the Agency was aware of diesel methanol vehicles which were throttled at idle. This same reasoning was applied
to gaseous-fueled vehicles, and EPA proposed that idle CO standards apply to all gaseous-fueled vehicles, not just
Otto-cycle vehicles. 


Summary of the comments: 

The few comments EPA received on this issue were in opposition to idle CO standards for engines which operate at lean
fuel/air ratios. The commenters stated that lean burn engines emit very low CO levels, and that there is no need to regulate
and test for emissions which are inherently low. 


EPA response to the comments: 

The Agency recognizes that lean burn engines do traditionally have much lower CO emissions than vehicles operating
at stoichiometric fuel/air ratios. However, EPA believes that not enough data yet exists on diesel gaseous-fueled
vehicles to justify their exemption from the idle CO standards. The Agency is especially concerned about those diesel
designs which employ throttling at idle. It is likely that these vehicles will have no problem meeting the idle CO standards
by virtue of their design and that, this being the case, the only burden this standard presents is that of the actual
certification testing and reporting. Thus, certification testing waivers for diesel gaseous-fueled vehicle idle
CO standards will be available to manufacturers that can demonstrate through emissions test data or other engineering
data that a vehicle will, by virtue of its design, always emit at levels well below that of the applicable idle CO standard.



2. Crankcase Emissions 




Summary of the proposal: 

Currently, all vehicles and engines, with the exception of non-naturally aspirated petroleum heavy-duty diesel
engines (HDDE), are prohibited from discharging crankcase emissions into the atmosphere. The current prohibition
is not applicable to non-naturally aspirated petroleum HDDEs due to concerns that the routing of oil mist-laden crankcase
gases through turbochargers and other air handling equipment may foul this equipment. With the issuance of the methanol
vehicle emission standards in 1989 this prohibition was applied to all methanol HDDEs whether they were naturally
aspirated or not. The reasoning was that methanol engine crankcase gases were expected to be cleaner than petroleum
diesel engine crankcase gases, and closer to gasoline engine crankcase emissions which are been routinely routed
through turbochargers. Given that gaseous-fueled vehicles are also expected to have cleaner crankcase emissions
than petroleum diesels, this prohibition on crankcase emissions was proposed to be applicable to all gaseous-fueled
vehicles and engines as well, with no exemption for non-naturally aspirated, gaseous-fueled HDDEs. 


Summary of the comments: 

In general, the comments received in this area were in opposition to crankcase controls for gaseous-fueled vehicles
and engines. Some commenters suggested that crankcase controls only be applied to naturally-aspirated gaseous-fueled
engines, as is currently the case with petroleum HDDEs. Others stated that, due to their inherently low emissions,
gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines should be exempt from all crankcase emission provisions. One commenter expressed
concern about crankcase gases possibly fouling turbochargers, and then went on to say that gaseous-fueled vehicle
crankcase emissions will be inherently clean and thus do not need to be regulated. 


EPA response to comments: 

In the absence of compelling data showing that gaseous-fueled vehicle crankcase emissions are cleaner than those
of their petroleum-fueled counterparts, the Agency believes it is prudent to extend the coverage of the current prohibition
on crankcase emissions to include gaseous-fueled HDDEs. Additionally, EPA believes that, since the crankcase prohibition
for methanol-fueled HDDEs is not limited to naturally-aspirated engines, as well as the fact that crankcase emissions
are routinely routed through gasoline engine turbochargers, there is no reason to exempt non-naturally aspirated
gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines from the crankcase emissions prohibition. As was noted in the leadtime discussion,
the Agency expects that current technology gaseous-fueled engines will be able to meet these standards, and therefore
the minimum amount of leadtime to allow for certification has been given. However, since turbocharged gaseous-fueled
HDDEs are generally derived from turbocharged petroleum HDDEs they do not tend to have crankcase emission controls.
The Agency believes that, while the four year leadtime requirement in section 203(a)(3)(C) of the Act is not legally
binding in the case of gaseous-fueled heavy-duty engines, in circumstances where the manufacturers must make changes
to engine designs similar to those made to comply with changes in gasoline or petroleum diesel requirements, section
203(a)(3)(C) may constitute a proper default period. In order to allow for the early introduction of gaseous-fueled
HDDEs, the Agency is providing four years leadtime for crankcase controls on turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs
in the absence of factors indicating that another period is more appropriate. Thus, this provision will take effect
for the 1998 model year. It should be noted that the four years of leadtime only applies to turbocharged gaseous-fueled
HDDEs, and that the crankcase emission provisions for all other classes of gaseous-fueled vehicles will take effect
with the 1997 model year mandatory certification, as well as for vehicles and engines certified optionally prior
to the 1997 model year. 


E. On-Board Diagnostics

Summary of the proposal: 

EPA did not specifically address in the November 5, 1992 proposal the applicability of on-board diagnostics (OBD)
requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles. This is because the OBD regulations were not promulgated until after the
gaseous-fueled vehicle standards were proposed.
 However, EPA proposed that emission standards for gaseous-fueled vehicles generally be equivalent to those for
other vehicles. Implicit in that proposal is that gaseous-fueled vehicles would be required to meet the same OBD requirements
as other vehicles (OBD II or Federal OBD, as applicable by model year). 






Summary of the comments: 

The Agency received several comments concerning OBD. These comments fell into two general areas. First, several
commenters requested that the Agency clarify the applicability of OBD requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles.
Second, comments were received stating that additional leadtime should be allowed for natural gas-fueled vehicles
to comply with OBD. The OBD provisions as promulgated require OBD systems to monitor for conditions which would result
in certain increases in THC emissions. The argument for additional leadtime centered around the fact that natural
gas vehicles will only be subject to NMHC standards while all other vehicles are subject to THC standards. During the
course of the OBD rulemaking comments were received suggesting that natural gas systems only be required to measure
NMHC emission effects. Commenters argued that the technology likely to be used to monitor for increases in THC could
not be readily adapted to monitor for increases in NMHC. The Agency received a comment suggesting that a delay until
1998 would allow sufficient leadtime to develop the technology needed for natural gas-fueled vehicles to meet the
OBD requirements. 


EPA response to comments: 

The OBD requirements contained in the February 19, 1993 rule were established pursuant to section 202(m) of the Clean
Air Act. That subsection provides, in pertinent part:



(1) [T]he Administrator shall promulgate regulations under subsection (a) requiring manufacturers to install
on all new light duty vehicles and light duty trucks diagnostic systems capable of_
(A) accurately identifying * * * emission-related systems deterioration or malfunction * * *
which could cause or result in failure of the vehicles to comply with emission standards established under this section.



By its terms, the OBD provision applies only to vehicles for which emission standards have been established under
section 202. The regulations promulgated on February 19, 1993 simply add a new requirement that all new light-duty
vehicles and light-duty trucks be equipped with an emission control diagnostic system capable of identifying emissions-related
deterioration and malfunction as detailed in the regulations.
 Therefore, this provision would seem to apply automatically to gaseous-fueled vehicles as soon as mandatory emissions
standards are established for those vehicles. 




EPA agrees that leadtime until the 1998 model year is necessary for full implementation of the Federal OBD requirements
for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Therefore, under today's regulations, implementation of Federal OBD systems
will not be required for certification prior to model year 1998. This is the case for both for voluntary certification
prior to model year 1997, and for mandatory certification in model year 1997. However, consistent with the approach
taken in the OBD rule for vehicles granted a waiver from Federal OBD requirements on feasibility grounds, natural
gas-fueled vehicles certified in the 1997 model year or optionally prior to the 1997 model year will be required to
comply with OBD I provisions. 
EPA believes that allowing leadtime for natural gas-fueled vehicles until the 1998 model year is legally consistent
with sections 202(m) and 202(a). To be sure, section 202(m)(2) specifically provides that the required OBD regulations
shall take effect in model year 1994, subject to the Administrator's authority to waiver application of the regulations
for model years 1994 and/or 1995 for any vehicle for which the Administrator determines the regulations would be infeasible
in those model years. But EPA believes that Congress intended this effective date provision to apply only to vehicles
for which standards existed at the time of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EPA does not believe
that Congress intended this provision to require OBD to be implemented immediately upon promulgation of any emission
standards under section 202(a)(1) for new kinds of alternative-fueled vehicles at any point after 1995. EPA cannot
adopt new emission standards for natural gas-fueled vehicles that would trigger a mandatory OBD requirement that
is not feasible. It is also unreasonable to believe Congress intended that EPA refrain from establishing mandatory
emission standards for natural gas-fueled vehicles simply because an infeasible OBD requirement would automatically
apply once such standards are established. The Agency's efforts to ensure that natural gas fueled vehicles' emissions
are no greater than their petroleum-fueled counterparts should not be frustrated by a concern that compliance with
an OBD requirement requires more leadtime than compliance with the emission standards themselves.

Rather, EPA believes that the OBD requirements under section 202(m)(1), to be promulgated under section 202(a),
incorporate the general leadtime provision in section 202(a)(2). Section 202(a)(2) specifically states that ``[a]ny
regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take effect after
such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology,
giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.'' EPA believes that this leadtime
provision applies to all aspects of new standards established with respect to previously unregulated alternative-fueled
vehicles. EPA agrees with commenters that leadtime until model year 1998 is necessary for implementation of Federal
OBD systems for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Therefore, Federal OBD requirements will not apply for certification
of such vehicles until model year 1998; compliance with OBD I provisions is required for any natural gas-fueled vehicles
certified prior to the 1998 model year, as discussed above. 

EPA also recognizes that the current OBD regulations apply to vehicles subject to a THC standard. As long as only a NMHC
standard applies to natural gas-fueled vehicles, these regulations should arguably be amended to monitor deterioration
and malfunction regarding NMHC emissions performance. EPA anticipates commencing a rulemaking to make these changes
to the OBD regulations as applicable to natural gas-fueled vehicles in the near future in time for the changes to apply
in the 1998 model year. This issue does not effect the feasibility of compliance with OBD I requirements. 

As was noted above, the Agency did not formally propose any specific requirements concerning the applicability of
OBD requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles. However, the Agency believes that this issue was fairly raised and
sufficiently considered prior to the promulgation of this final rule since EPA's initial proposal intended to extend
all applicable emission standards to gaseous-fueled vehicles, and the Agency received several comments on OBD in
response to that proposal. For more discussion of this issue please consult the summary and analysis document. 



F. HC Measurement 





Summary of the proposal:

 The current method for measuring exhaust NMHC, which was adopted for the Tier 1 tailpipe standards, involves measuring
THC and methane, and subtracting methane from THC to obtain NMHC. For NGVs the exhaust HC is primarily methane, whereas
for other vehicles the exhaust methane tends to be a much lower percentage of THC. As a result, the current procedure
is much less accurate for NGVs than for other vehicles, and the need for a better measurement technique is obvious.
The NPRM discussed several potential options for improved, direct NMHC measurement. However, none of these techniques
was developed sufficiently enough to warrant proposal. Thus, the Agency proposed, as an interim procedure, some
slight modifications to the current procedure to improve its accuracy for NGVs. Additionally, EPA proposed that
if a better technique had not been developed within the first two years of these standards' applicability then full
gas chromatograph (GC) analysis would be required. This was intended to provide the industry with incentive to develop
a better alternative since the inaccuracies of the current procedure clearly preclude it from being a long term solution.




Summary of the comments:

 EPA received little comment on this aspect of the proposal. A few commenters voiced support for the interim procedure,
while some expressed concern over how resource-intensive full GC analysis would be for routine certification work.


EPA response to comments: The Agency agrees with the commenters that the modifications to the current procedure constitute
the best interim option, and this is the technique that is contained in today's rule. Additionally, EPA has entered
into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the California Air Resources Board and the American
Automobile Manufacturers Association to address a variety of test procedures needs which have arisen out of the Clean
Air Act Amendments. One of the projects the CRADA is addressing is that of an accurate technique for the direct measurement
of NMHC. The Agency believes that since it is participating in the development process through the CRADA a technology-forcing
approach is not necessary at this time. Thus, rather than finalize a requirement for full GC analysis, the best approach
would be to continue to work through the CRADA to develop an NMHC technique which can be adopted as the certification
procedure upon its completion. However, if an appropriate technique is not developed through the CRADA, EPA will
consider a more accurate procedure such as the GC for the required procedure.

G. Fuel Composition 





Summary of the proposal:

 It is the Agency's belief that certification test fuels should resemble the fuels that a vehicle is likely to encounter
in-use. Given the wide range of natural gas compositions currently available throughout the United States, the Agency
proposed very broad specifications for natural gas certification fuel. These specifications included a range for
methane content of 74 to 98.5 percent, as well as broad ranges for several other parameters. In the case of LPG fuel,
much less information is available about composition variability nationally. Thus, commercially available LPG
was proposed as the certification fuel, with no specific ranges set on any parameters other than that the primary constituent
be propane. The NPRM contained no provisions for the regulation of in-use composition of either fuel. 



Summary of the comments:

 Although the Agency received some comments in support of its proposed certification fuel specifications, in general
commenters believed that the proposed specifications were much too broad. In terms of natural gas specifications,
the comments in favor of tighter specifications fell into two general categories. First, several commenters stated
that they agreed with EPA's general approach of a broadly defined specification in order that certification fuel
be representative of in-use fuel. These commenters, however, felt that the proposed fuel specification was much
too broad and encompassed fuels which could not be considered representative of most natural gas. Other commenters
felt that, in order to be able to meaningfully compare results from different tests, a very narrowly defined test fuel
specification is needed. Most of these commenters recommended that EPA adopt the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) certification fuel (90% methane, 

#

 1%, among other requirements) as the federal certification fuel. Some of the commenters who recommended a narrower
range of specifications suggested that EPA adopt a range of specifications which would allow the use of CARB certification
fuel (e.g., 89% methane, minimum, etc.). 

The Agency received little comment on the proposed LPG certification fuel specifications. A few commenters suggested
that EPA adopt the CARB LPG certification fuel specifications (93.5% propane, 

#

1%, etc.) as the federal certification fuel. Some commenters agreed with the proposal, stating that it allowed for
the use of butane mixtures in LPG vehicles. 

In addition to comments about certification fuel specifications, several comments were received requesting that
the Agency adopt in-use fuel specifications. These comments generally came from engine and vehicle manufacturers.
These commenters explained that in order to get maximum emission benefits from gaseous-fueled vehicles it is important
to minimize in-use fuel composition variability. In addition, heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers stated that,
unlike stoichiometric engines utilizing oxygen sensor feedback control systems, lean-burn diesel engines have
no way of accounting for fuel composition variability, and thus may encounter operational difficulties on some fuels.




EPA response to comments:

 The Agency both understands and sees the merits in the arguments for tighter certification fuel specifications.
However, as was previously stated, EPA also believes it is important that certification fuel be representative of
in-use fuel. Thus, in developing today's final rule the Agency has attempted to find a middle ground between these
seemingly conflicting needs. In the case of natural gas certification fuel, the Agency is adopting the approach suggested
by some commenters that the specification remain somewhat broad, but allow for the use of CARB certification fuel.
This specification includes a minimum methane content of 89 percent, among other parameters. For the complete certification
fuel specifications please see the regulatory text of today's rule. These specifications were chosen both because
they encompass over 90 percent of natural gas sold in the country and because there was some general support for them
in the comments as a good compromise between EPA's proposed specifications and CARB certification fuel. 

Almost all of the gas not covered by this specification (i.e., gas with a methane content below 89 percent) is sold in
high altitude areas where the gas tends to contain higher levels of inert gases than that sold at low altitudes. The
Agency believes that excluding high altitude gas from the specifications should not present a problem for vehicles
which are certified using the 89 percent minimum methane certification fuel but are operated at high altitudes because,
in general, vehicles which will be certified under the provisions of today's rule are expected to utilize electronic
feedback control systems for proper management of the fuel/air ratio. The Agency believes that these systems will
be able to account for any differences in fuel composition between high altitude natural gas and natural gas in the
rest of the country.

<PARENT> FR940921-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

It should be noted that, while the natural gas certification fuel specifications contained in today's rule are much
broader than CARB's, CARB certification fuel does fall within the federal specifications, and thus could be used
for certification testing. For a further discussion of this issue please consult the summary and analysis of comments
document available in the public docket.

The Agency would like to take a similar approach for LPG certification fuel as it took for natural gas certification
fuel. However, there is little information available about in-use LPG composition upon which such a fuel specification
could be based. Thus, EPA believes it prudent to adopt commercial LPG as the certification fuel at this time. Should
adequate information on in-use LPG composition become available at some point in the future, EPA may elect to define
a certification fuel specification for LPG at that time.

Today's rule contains no controls on in-use fuel composition for either natural gas or LPG. EPA does not believe that
the need for such in-use controls has been adequately demonstrated. Further, the cost-effectiveness of such controls
is not likely to justify such action. The Agency is concerned, however, about the possibility of in-use fuel composition
changes over time, and urges the natural gas and LPG industries to take steps to minimize such variations. Should the
in-use compositions of these fuels change in such a way as to adversely impact the emissions performance of gaseous-fueled
vehicles the Agency would likely take steps to address the issue at that time, either through corresponding changes
in certification fuel specifications, or possibly through in-use fuel composition specifications.



H. Fuel Economy





Summary of the proposal: 

The NPRM included test procedures and calculations for determining the fuel economy of natural gas-fueled light-duty
vehicles and light-duty trucks for purposes of allowing them to be included in a manufacturer's CAFE calculation.
The proposed procedures for determining the fuel economy of natural gas vehicles (NGV) utilize the same principles
as those used in the procedures currently in place for gasoline vehicles. Availability of CAFE credits for NGVs was
mandated in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988 (Public Law 100-494, October 14, 1988), to be effective
with the 1993 model year. No CAFE provisions regarding LPG vehicles were proposed.



Summary of the comments: 

In general, the comments regarding the CAFE provisions for NGVs were very supportive. Some commenters urged EPA to
quickly finalize this rule in order to assure that CAFE credits will be available for 1993 model year NGVs. The lack
of fuel economy provisions for LPG vehicles, however, was perceived by many as an unfair disadvantage for LPG vehicles.
Additionally, many commenters pointed out that the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated the availability
of CAFE credits for LPG vehicles, and urged EPA to finalize fuel economy test procedures and calculations for LPG vehicles.



EPA response to comments: 

The Agency did not propose fuel economy measurement procedures for LPG vehicles because prior to the National Energy
Policy Act of 1992 the determination of whether LPG vehicles should be included in the CAFE program was required to
be made by the Secretary of Transportation under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (U.S.C. 2001(5)). At the time
EPA issued the NPRM for today's action the Secretary of Transportation had not made a determination to include LPG
vehicles in the CAFE program. The Energy Policy Act allowing LPG vehicles to participate in the CAFE program was signed
into law just as EPA issued its proposal. Thus, no fuel economy provisions were proposed for LPG vehicles. There are
two reasons why EPA is not adopting fuel economy provisions for LPG vehicles in this rule. First, before EPA can adopt
fuel economy test procedures and calculations for LPG vehicles, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is required
by the Energy Policy Act to determine a fuel equivalency factor equating gasoline and LPG so that fuel economy can be
calculated on a gasoline gallon- equivalent basis. This fuel equivalency factor has not yet been set by DOT. Second,
the Agency believes that the required new fuel economy measurement provisions for LPG vehicles must be subject to
public notice and comment. Thus, the Agency will work with DOT to develop the fuel equivalency factor, and, upon determination
of that factor, will propose LPG fuel economy provisions in a separate Agency rulemaking action.

I. Aftermarket Conversions



1. Applicability





Summary of the proposal: 

It is the Agency's policy that, based on the tampering provisions of section 203(a)(3) of the Act, aftermarket conversions
should not degrade the emissions performance of the vehicle being converted, and that following a conversion a vehicle
should still meet the emission standards it was originally certified as meeting on any fuels it is capable of using.
Under this policy any conversion which degrades the emissions performance of the vehicle is considered tampering.
In order to clarify how compliance with this policy can be demonstrated, the Agency proposed that converters can certify
as new vehicle manufacturers using the current new vehicle certification procedures applicable to small volume
manufacturers. The Agency requested comment on whether the volume limit of 10,000 units that currently defines a
small volume manufacturer should apply to conversions as well, or whether, as proposed, the small volume procedures
should apply to all converters, regardless of the conversion sales volume of the company seeking the certification.
These certification requirements were proposed to apply to all aftermarket conversions performed or sold after
December 31, 1993, regardless of the class or model year of the vehicle being converted. In the proposal the Agency
stated its belief that this rule would not require any leadtime for technology development and that the only leadtime
required would be for the actual certification process.



Summary of the comments: 

In general, the comments received on the aftermarket conversion provisions were very supportive, with several commenters
expressing the need for such requirements, and none completely opposed. One commenter suggested that these requirements
should only apply to conversions in areas which are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards.
Comments were received both in favor of and opposed to applying the 10,000 limit to the use of the small volume procedures
for conversions. Other comments received indicated that there was some confusion as to the applicability of the proposed
requirements to conversions done before 1994, as well as to conversions of pre-1994 model year vehicles performed
after December 31, 1993.



EPA response to comments: 

As was stated in the description of today's rule, an aftermarket conversion company can choose to comply with these
provisions to obtain an exemption from the tampering prohibition. Only conversions which are intended to generate
some form of credit, such as clean-fueled fleet vehicle purchase credits, will be required to comply with these provisions.
Converters which choose not to obtain an exemption from the tampering prohibition under this procedure will be handled
under the current tampering policy. Given that this is an optional certification procedure for conversions the issues
of leadtime and mandatory start date are less relevant.

The Agency agrees with the comment that the production volume limits that currently define a small volume manufacturer
also apply to converters seeking to certify as manufacturers under today's program. The Agency expects that the demand
for aftermarket conversions will grow dramatically over the next few years in response to a variety of state and federal
programs. It seems reasonable to require the larger conversion companies to undergo full new vehicle certification
if they choose to get an exemption from the tampering prohibition by certifying as a manufacturer. Thus, the volume
limits that currently apply to manufacturers seeking to certify under the small volume manufacturers provisions
will also apply to converters seeking to certify as manufacturers. The Agency recognizes that, while the current
small volume manufacturers limit applies to sales for a particular model year, conversions are routinely performed
on older vehicles, and a conversion company may offer conversion systems for vehicles from several different model
years at any given time. Thus, the 10,000 sales volume limit for certifying under the small volume manufacturers procedures
will apply to calendar year sales for the purposes of aftermarket conversions. For a further discussion of how this
volume limit will be applied see the summary and analysis of comments document.



2. Test Procedures





Summary of the proposal: 

In the NPRM the Agency proposed using the same test procedures for conversions that are used for new vehicle and engine
certification. This approach was proposed because the Agency believes that this is the only way of truly measuring
the emissions performance of a conversion relative to the emission standards applicable to the original vehicle
or engine.



Summary of the comments: 

Most of the comments received on the issue of test procedures for aftermarket conversions concerned the differences
between EPA's proposed procedures and those adopted by CARB. In general, where there are differences between CARB's
procedures and those proposed by EPA the commenters requested that the Agency adopt the CARB procedures instead of
what it proposed. In the case of procedures for converted light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks EPA's proposed
test procedures are essentially the same as CARB's. Thus, there is no issue in the case of light-duty vehicle and light-duty
truck certification procedures for aftermarket conversions.

<TEXT>
 

EPA's proposed procedures for conversions of vehicles whose 
engines were originally certified on an engine dynamometer (i.e., 
most heavy-duty engines) are quite different than CARB's. As was 
previously mentioned, the Agency proposed that conversions in this 
category be certified using the test procedure used to certify the 
original engine. That procedure is the engine dynamometer-based 
heavy-duty transient test. CARB's procedures use the chassis 
dynamometer-based urban dynamometer driving cycle for conversions 
of vehicles 14,000 pounds and under gross vehicle weight (GVW). 
For conversions of vehicles greater than 14,000 pounds GVW, CARB's 
procedures allow for either steady-state chassis dynamometer 
testing or an engine dynamometer test approved by the CARB 
Executive Officer. Most of the comments received on this issue 
requested that, in order to reduce compliance costs, EPA adopt the 
CARB test procedures for aftermarket conversions. One commenter 
also suggested that it is unfair to require conversions for heavy-duty engines to be certified using the heavy-duty
transient test 
because there are few available testing facilities at which one 
could get the required testing done. 




EPA response to comments: 

The Agency continues to believe that the 
most appropriate way to determine whether an aftermarket conversion 
meets the emission standards that the original vehicle or engine 
was certified to is to use the same test procedures that were used 
in certifying the original vehicle or engine. As the comments 
suggest, this is only an issue for the conversions intended for 
vehicles originally certified using the engine dynamometer 
procedures. While the Agency understands the concerns voiced by 
the commenters, it does not believe that there is an adequate 
alternative to using the original test procedures when attempting 
to demonstrate compliance with the original standards. In the case 
of the CARB procedures, CARB uses an approach whereby compliance is 
determined by comparing post-conversion emissions performance with 
pre-conversion performance, and allowing for some increase in 
emissions to account for test to test variability. Given this 
approach, it is not nearly as important for CARB to use the same 
test procedures that were used to certify the original vehicle 
because the standards being certified to are not those the vehicle 
was originally certified as meeting. However, by taking this 
approach it is possible that an aftermarket conversion which 
exceeds the original configuration's emissions standards could be 
certified, which is in conflict with the anti-tampering provisions 
of the Act.

<TEXT>
 

In the case of vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVW, CARB allows 
the use of eight mode steady-state testing, using the same pre-conversion, post-conversion comparison as for vehicles
under 14,000 
pounds GVW. Again, the Agency believes that it is possible with 
this approach to certify an aftermarket conversion which exceeds 
the original configuration's emissions standards. Also, the Agency 
does not believe that steady-state testing is appropriate under any 
circumstances. It is well-understood that emission control systems 
can be designed for low emissions when tested using steady-state 
test procedures, but provide little emissions control under real-world, transient conditions.
 It is for this reason that EPA 
adopted the heavy-duty transient test cycle in place of the 
thirteen mode steady state test for all heavy-duty engine 
certification, effective in the mid-1980s. Thus, EPA does not 
believe that it would be appropriate to adopt the CARB test 
procedures for these vehicles. It should be noted that CARB does 
allow for alternative test cycles for vehicles over 14,000 pounds 
GVW, subject to advance approval from the Executive Officer. It is 
the Agency's belief that, given the transient test is the test 
cycle which these vehicles would have originally been certified on, 
it is likely that CARB would approve its use for conversion 
certification, thus eliminating the need for two separate 
certification procedures for vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVW. 





3. On-Board Diagnostics 





Summary of the proposal: 

The Agency recently adopted requirements, 
effective for the 1994 model year and thereafter, which require on-board diagnostics (OBD) systems on new light-duty
vehicles and 
light-duty trucks.
 The purpose of the OBD system is, in part, 
to monitor the performance of a vehicle's emission control systems 
and signal to the vehicle operator if a system is malfunctioning. 
The Agency did not propose any specific requirements regarding how 
aftermarket conversions would interact with new vehicle OBD 
systems, but required that converted vehicles remain in compliance 
with all applicable Clean Air Act Title II emission requirements. 







Summary of the comments: 

The Agency only received a few comments 
on the issue of aftermarket conversions and OBD. These comments 
tended not to be specific, but rather asked the Agency to clarify 
what the requirements were for an aftermarket conversion on an OBD-equipped vehicle. A few commenters suggested
that EPA require new 
vehicle manufacturers to provide some means of shutting off the OBD 
system during alternative fuel operation in order to prevent the 
system from storing faulty trouble codes. 



EPA response to comments: 

As explained in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, EPA believes that a tampering exemption should be 
conditioned upon certification demonstrating that the converted 
vehicle has the ability to comply with the applicable emission 
standards and will have demonstrated adequate durability. As was 
mentioned above, shortly after publication of the proposal for this 
rule, the Agency adopted requirements, effective for the 1994 model 
year, which require OBD systems on new light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks. 

While the aftermarket conversions proposal did not explicitly 
make clear that compliance with the OBD requirements (as well as 
certain other title II requirements) must be demonstrated to obtain 
a certification, the Agency believes this is implicit in the 
discussion of the justification for the exemption. The Agency 
explained in the proposal that ``Congress intended to prohibit 
tampering that would result in emission noncompliance,'' and that 
``[t]he language of the tampering provisions emphasizes the 
compliance of the vehicle with the title II regulations.'' 

EPA's justification for the exemption for conversions from 
tampering restrictions was based on the incongruity of prohibiting 
conversions that result in a vehicle meeting emission standards 
applicable to vehicles of the fuel type to which the vehicles have 
been converted. The OBD requirements, even if not ``emissions 
standards'' in the traditional sense, clearly have an underlying 
emissions control purpose. And the tampering prohibitions of 
section 203(a)(3) of the Act explicitly apply to the disabling of 
any device ``installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
engine in compliance with regulations under this title. . .'' 
Disabling an OBD system is clearly prohibited as tampering. It is 
therefore not at all clear that EPA would have authority to provide 
an exemption from the tampering prohibition for a conversion that 
do not meet the same OBD requirements as the vehicle would have had 
to meet had it been originally manufactured to operate on fuel type 
to which it has been converted.

<TEXT>
 

The logic of the Agency's tampering exemption for aftermarket 
conversions thus indicates that the Agency intended that the 
exemption be conditioned on compliance with all title II 
requirements applicable to the converted vehicle when operating on 
either fuel. Certainly, even if the proposal did not specifically 
make clear that it intended to require compliance with OBD as a 
condition for a tampering exemption, that requirement is a logical 
outgrowth of the discussion in the proposal. The comments of 
interested parties reflect a recognition of EPA's authority to 
require compliance with OBD as a condition of the tampering 
exemption. These comments demonstrate the adequacy of notice.





4. Liability 




Summary of the proposal: 

In the NPRM the Agency proposed that, in 
order to be exempt from the Clean Air Act's tampering prohibition, 
the manufacturers and installers of aftermarket conversions must 
accept in-use liability for warranty and recall as outlined in 
section 207 of the Act and its implementing regulations.
 Additionally, EPA proposed that the vehicle's original manufacturer 
remain liable for the in-use performance of any systems which 
retain their original purpose following conversion, except in cases 
where the failure of such a system is determined to be caused by 
the conversion. The Agency proposed that the useful life of a 
conversion be the same as that of the vehicle being converted, and 
requested comment on whether the useful life of the conversion 
should be measured from the time of the conversion or from the time 
of the original vehicle's manufacture.






Summary of the comments: 

The Agency received a variety of comments 
on the proposed liability scheme. In general, commenters agreed on 
the need for in-use liability for warranty and recall, but differed 
on where or with whom this liability should be placed. Some 
commenters suggested that the primary liability should be with the 
conversion system manufacturer, and that the installer should only 
be held liable for the proper installation of the conversion 
system. Other commenters agreed with EPA's proposed liability 
suggesting both that this approach would protect the conversion 
consumer in the event that one party went out of business, and that 
it would allow manufacturers and installers to negotiate risk of 
failure between them. Comments received on the issue of liability 
of the vehicle's original manufacturer for the proper functioning 
of original equipment also supported both sides of the issue, with 
some commenters suggesting that the original manufacturer's 
liability should end at the time of conversion and others 
supporting the Agency's proposed approach. Finally, all comments 
received on the issue of when the useful life begins were in favor 
of reducing the useful life requirement of the conversion by the 
amount of the original vehicle's useful life which had already 
passed at the time of conversion. These commenters suggested that, 
because aftermarket conversions generally depend on the original 
vehicle equipment to some extent for emissions performance, it 
would not be appropriate to require the conversion to continue 
meeting applicable emission standards after the original equipment 
had exceeded its useful life.



EPA response to the comments: 

The Agency believes that by holding 
the entity which certifies the conversion system liable for the in-
use performance of the converted vehicle it has the greatest chance 
of assuring quality conversions which will meet applicable emission 
standards throughout their useful lives. If poor installation were 
a defense to liability, then certifiers would have no interest in 
insuring their installers are competent. Such an approach does not 
rely on who manufactures or installs the system, but on who 
certifies the system as meeting applicable standards. At the time 
of vehicle conversion the system certifier assumes liability for 
the converted vehicle's in-use emissions performance. The 
certifier may elect to have outside agents conduct installations. 
However, the certifier will be solely responsible for the converted 
vehicle's in-use emission performance. For this reason the Agency 
recommends that those certifiers electing to have outside agents 
conduct installations work to assure quality system installation. 
EPA believes that it is appropriate to hold the original 
vehicle manufacturer liable for the performance of any parts or 
systems which retain their original function following conversion. 
If the failure of such a part or system could be traced to the 
conversion then the liability would lie with the conversion 
certifier. A good indication of where the liability lies in such 
situations would be whether the failure of a part or system is also 
occurring in non-converted configurations of the same vehicle. 
The Agency agrees with the comments that it is not appropriate 
to extend the useful life of a conversion past that of the original 
vehicle, given that conversions generally rely on many original 
vehicle components for proper operation. Thus, the applicable 
useful life of any conversion will be reduced by the amount of 
mileage on the vehicle at the time of conversion (

i.e., 

the useful 
life of a conversion will end at the same point that the useful 
life of the original vehicle ends). 


IV. Environmental Effects

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940921-0-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940921-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The general goal of today's emission standards is to provide 
a level playing field for gaseous-fueled vehicles relative to other 
currently regulated vehicles, and to remove a potential barrier to 
their commercial production. Thus, this rule is not intended to 
generate significant emission reductions beyond those achieved by 
vehicles operating on other fuel types. As such, the Agency has 
not attempted to accurately quantify the environmental effects of 
today's rule. However, there are likely to be some beneficial 
differences between the emissions from gaseous-fueled vehicles and 
conventional vehicles, including possible benefits in the areas of 
NMHC, CO and air toxics, as well as benefits associated with 
improved aftermarket conversions. For a complete discussion of 
these potential benefits please consult the discussion of 
environmental effects contained in the NPRM.






V. Economic Impacts 


The Agency expects the emission standards contained in this 
rule to be attainable using emission control technology which is 
similar to that used on current vehicles. Indeed, this has been 
the case thus far with the vehicles which have shown the ability to 
comply with the standards. Thus, EPA expects that the cost of 
emission controls for natural gas- and liquefied petroleum 
gas-fueled vehicles will be similar to that for current vehicles. 
There are two instances, however, where compliance with the 
standards may be less costly for gaseous-fueled vehicles than for 
current vehicles: evaporative emissions, and exhaust aftertreatment 
for gaseous-fueled heavy-duty diesel engines. For a complete 
discussion of these potential benefits please consult the 
discussion of economic impacts contained in the NPRM.





It is not expected that these regulations will have a 
significant impact on the cost of aftermarket conversions of 
conventional-fueled vehicles to operate on gaseous fuels. The 
chief area of change in response to these regulations will be in 
the area of durability improvements. This may involve some 
increase in cost, but overall the impacts should be small. 
Since the purpose of today's standards is to remove the 
regulatory uncertainty associated with gaseous-fueled vehicles and 
to place them on an equal footing with other vehicles, and not 
necessarily to achieve emission reductions, the Agency does not 
believe it is appropriate to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis 
for these standards. Although the Agency does expect some emission 
reductions to result from these standards, that is not the purpose 
of these regulations. Thus, the benefits cannot be readily 
quantified in terms of pollutant inventory reductions, nor is it 
appropriate to do this. For these reasons no cost effectiveness 
analysis was performed. 


VI. Statutory Authority 


Authority for the actions in this rule is granted to EPA by 
sections 202, 203 and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 
and 7601(a)). 


VII. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866,
 the Agency must determine 
whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore 
subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the 
requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines 
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in 
a rule that may: 




(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million 
or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or State, local or 
tribal governments or communities; 

(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere 
with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

<DOCNO> FR940921-0-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940921-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory
action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in
response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.



VIII. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements



The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Public recordkeeping
burden is estimated to average 115 hours per response. It is not anticipated that the revisions being promulgated
today will have any impact on the recordkeeping burden. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them
and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the 

Federal Register

.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information
Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' 



IX. Impact on Small Entities 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA is required to determine whether a regulation will
have a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The new vehicle standards will affect only manufacturers of motor
vehicles and motor vehicle engines, a group which does not contain a substantial number of small entities. The aftermarket
conversion portions of today's regulations will not significantly impact the small businesses in the aftermarket
conversion industry because the provisions are voluntary, and the cost of voluntary compliance with these requirements
will be small when spread over the projected volumes of conversions expected to be sold in the near future.



X. Judicial Review



Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby finds that these regulations are of national applicability.
Accordingly, judicial review of this action is available only by filing a petition for review in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by September 21, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the
requirements which are the subject of today's notice may not be challenged later in judicial proceedings brought
by EPA to enforce these requirements.

 86.105

Introduction; structure of subpart. 



* * * * * 



(b) Three topics are addressed in this subpart. Sections 86.106 through 86.115 set forth specifications and equipment
requirements;   86.116 through 86.126 discuss calibration methods and frequency; test procedures
and data requirements are listed in   86.127 through 86.157.

44. Section 86.106-94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 



 86.106-94

Equipment required; overview. 



(a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission
tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty
vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, 

e.g., 

evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if
shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications
are as follows: 

(1) 

Evaporative emission tests. 

The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested
for evaporative emissions must be tested for exhaust emissions. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is
waived by the Administrator under  86.090-26, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled
diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.


(2) 

Exhaust emission tests. 

All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using
the CVS concept ( 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of these regulations.
Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A are exempted from testing
for methane emissions (except natural gas-fueled vehicles). Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards
are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions,
use of a dilution tunnel is not required ( 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate
emission sampling is required ( 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires
that a PDP-CVS or CFV with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles;
however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All gasoline-fueled,
methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquified petroleum gas-fueled vehicles are either tested for evaporative
emissions or undergo a diurnal heat build. Petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles are excluded from this requirement.
Equipment necessary and specifications appear in   86.108 through 86.114. 

(3) 

Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. 

Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in
 86.113. Analytical gases are specified in  86.114. The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS)
for use in exhaust emissions tests is specified in  86.115 and Appendix I of this part.

45. Section 86.106-96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 



 86.106-96

Equipment required; overview. 



(a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission
tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty
vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, 

e.g., 

evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if
shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications
are as follows: 

(1) 

Evaporative emission tests. 

The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested
for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in  86.130-96;
however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator
may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless
the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under  86.090-26, all vehicles must undergo
both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107
specifies the necessary equipment. 

(2) 

Exhaust emission tests. 

All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using
the CVS concept (see  86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this
part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted
from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing
for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution
tunnel is not required (see  86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission
sampling is required (see  86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires
that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle
vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles
equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled
diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement. 

(3) 

Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. 

Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in
 86.113. Analytical gases are specified in  86.114. The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS)
for use in exhaust emissions tests is specified in  86.115 and Appendix I of this part.

46. Section 86.107-96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows: 



 86.107-96

Sampling and analytical system; evaporative emissions. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * * 

(1) For gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon
analyzer utilizing the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere within
the enclosure (a heated FID (HFID)(235
 

#

15
 F (113
 

#

8
 C)) is required for methanol-fueled vehicles). For natural gas-fueled vehicles, the FID may be calibrated
using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID
hydrocarbon reading. Provided evaporative emission results are not effected, a probe may be used to detect or verify
hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall
have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds.

Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. 


* * * * * 


(a) * * * 
(2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce 
into the analyzer a propane (methane as appropriate) in air mixture 
(methanol in air mixture for methanol-fueled vehicles when optional 
methanol calibrated HFID procedure is used during the 1994 model 
year) with a propane (or methane or methanol as appropriate) 
concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most common 
operating range. 


* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with 
propane in air calibration gases (either methanol or methane in air 
as appropriate) having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 
and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least squares best-fit straight line is two 
percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for 
that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the 
best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within 
two percent of each test point shall be used to determine 
concentration. 


* * * * * 


(d)

hydrocarbon samples, the methane response factor of the analyzer 
shall be established. To determine the total hydrocarbon FID 
response to methane, known methane in air concentrations traceable 
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall 
be analyzed by the FID. Several methane concentrations shall be 
analyzed by the FID in the range of concentrations in the exhaust 
sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response to methane is

=FIDppm/SAMppm



Where:



(1) r

CH4

=FID response factor to methane. 
(2) FIDppm=FID reading in ppmC. 
(3) SAMppm=the known methane concentration in ppmC.

, and particulate mass 
emissions from gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled 
Otto-cycle vehicles as well as methanol and formaldehyde from 
methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, while simulating an average 
trip in an urban area of 11 miles (18 kilometers). The test 
consists of engine start-ups and vehicle operation on a chassis 
dynamometer through a specified driving schedule. A proportional 
part of the diluted exhaust is collected continuously for 
subsequent analysis, using a constant volume (variable dilution) 
sampler or critical flow venturi sampler. 


* * * * * 


(d) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled 
vehicles, methanol-fueled and gaseous-fueled vehicles) is designed 
to determine hydrocarbon and methanol evaporative emissions as a 
consequence of diurnal temperature fluctuation, urban driving and 
hot soaks following drives. It is associated with a series of 
events that a vehicle may experience and that may result in 
hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor losses. The test procedure is 
designed to measure: 


* * * * * 


(2) Running losses resulting from a simulated trip 
performed on a chassis dynamometer, measured by the enclosure or 
point-source technique (see  86.134; this test is not required for 
gaseous-fueled vehicles); and 


* * * * * 


(e) Fuel spitback emissions occur when a vehicle's fuel 
fill neck cannot accommodate dispensing rates. The vehicle test 
for spitback consists of a short drive followed immediately by a 
complete refueling event. This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.

diurnal sequence depicted in figure B96-10 tests vehicles for all 
sources of evaporative emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal 
test sequence is designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently 
purge their evaporative canisters during the exhaust emission test. 
Sections 86.132-96, 86.133-96 and 86.138-96 describe the separate 
specifications of the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. 
(2) 

Gaseous-fueled vehicles. 

The test sequence shown in 
figure B96-10 shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle 
undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine 
conformity with the standards set forth, with the exception that 
the fuel drain and fill and precondition canister steps are not 
required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. In addition, the 
supplemental two-diurnal test and the running loss test are not 
required. 
(b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel 
dispensing is conducted as a stand-alone test (see  86.146). This 
test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.

paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3), to read as follows: 


 86.133-96 

Diurnal emission test. 


(a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, 
methanol- and gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour 
test cycles following the hot soak test. Emissions are measured 
for each 24-hour cycle, with the highest emission level used to 
determine compliance with the standards specified in subpart A of 
this part. The Administrator may truncate a test after any 24-hour 
cycle without affecting the validity of the collected data. 
Sampling of emissions from the running loss and hot soak tests is 
not required as preparation for the diurnal emission test. The 
diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the three- 
diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test 
sequence, as described in  86.130-96. 


* * * * * 


(3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the 
diurnal emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section

Running loss test. 


(a) 

Overview. 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are 
to be tested for running loss emissions during simulated 
high-temperature urban driving; this test is not required for 
gaseous-fueled vehicles. During operation, tank temperatures are 
controlled according to a prescribed profile to simulate in-use 
conditions. If the vehicle is determined to have exceeded the 
standard before the end of the running loss test, the test may be 
terminated without invalidating the data. The test can be run 
either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source method, as 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

 86.135-94 



Dynamometer procedure. 



* * * * * 



(a) 

Overview. 

The dynamometer run consists of two tests, a ``cold'' start test, after a minimum 12-hour and a maximum 36-hour soak
according to the provisions of   86.132 and 86.133, and a ``hot'' start test following the ``cold'' start
by 10 minutes. Engine startup (with all accessories turned off), operation over the UDDS and engine shutdown make
a complete cold start test. Engine startup and operation over the first 505 seconds of the driving schedule complete
the hot start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air in the dilution tunnel as shown in Figure B94-5
and Figure B94-6. A dilution tunnel is not required for testing vehicles waived from the requirement to measure
particulates. Six particulate samples are collected on filters for weighing; the first sample plus backup is collected
during the first 505 seconds of the cold start test; the second sample plus backup is collected during the remainder
of the cold start test (including shutdown); the third sample plus backup is collected during the hot start test. Continuous
proportional samples of gaseous emissions are collected for analysis during each test phase. For gasoline-fueled,
natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the composite samples collected in
bags are analyzed for THC, CO, CO

2

, CH

4

 and NO

X

. For petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles (optional for natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled
and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), THC is sampled and analyzed continuously according to the provisions
of  86.110. Parallel samples of the dilution air are similarly analyzed for THC, CO, CO

2

, CH

4

 and NO

X

. For natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles, bag samples are collected
and analyzed for THC (if not sampled continuously), CO, CO

2

, CH

4

 and NO

X

. For methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol and formaldehyde samples are taken for both exhaust emissions and dilution
air (a single dilution air formaldehyde sample, covering the total test period may be collected). Parallel bag samples
of dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, CO

2

, CH

4

 and NO

X

. Methanol and formaldehyde samples may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model years when a FID calibrated on methanol
is used.

66. A new section 86.157-98 is added to subpart B to read 
as follows: 



 86.157-98 

Refueling test procedures for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. 



(a) 

Equipment. 

(1) The sampling and analytical system 
shall meet the specifications in  86.107-98(a) through (i). 

(2) The refueling equipment nozzle specifications shall 
meet the requirements described in  80.32. 

(b) 

General requirements. 

(1) The refueling test 
procedure for light-duty liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles 
and trucks starts with the preconditioning of the vehicle followed 
by a refueling emissions measurement. The test is conducted by 
following paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section in order. 

(2) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test 
vehicle throughout the test sequence shall not be less than 68
 F 
(20
 C) nor more than 86
 F (30
 C). 

(3) The vehicle shall be approximately level during all 
phases of the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution. 

(c) 

Vehicle preconditioning. 

(1) The vehicle fuel tanks 
are to be filled with fuel that meets the specifications in 
 86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled to 10 percent of nominal fuel 
tank capacity, determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon 
(0.38 liter). 

(2) The vehicle shall be parked (without starting the 
engine) within the temperature range specified in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of six 
hours. 

(d) 

Measurement procedure. 

(1) The steps prior to the 
actual refueling event described in  86.154-98(b) through (e)(5) 
shall be performed. 

(2) Within one minute of obtaining the initial FID (or 
HFID) reading, the dispensed fuel nozzle shall be attached to the 
vehicle fuel receptacle, and the refueling operation shall be 
started. If the vehicle is equipped with a fixed liquid level 
gauge or other gauge or valve which could be opened to release fuel 
or fuel vapor during refueling, and has not received an exemption 
as outlined in   86.098-28(h), 86.001-28(h) or 86.004-28(h), the 
fixed level gauge or other gauges or valves shall be opened after 
the dispensing nozzle is attached, but prior to the start of the 
refueling operation. The dispensed fuel must be at a temperature 
stabilized to approximately the same temperature as the vehicle was 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The dispensing rate must be 
typical of in-use dispensing rates for liquefied petroleum gas into light-duty 
vehicles and trucks. 

(3) The fuel flow shall continue until the amount of fuel 
dispensed is at least 85 percent of nominal fuel tank capacity, 
determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter). 

(4) Following the fuel shut-off the fixed liquid level 
gauge or other gauges or valves, if open, shall be closed and the 
nozzle disconnected. 

(5) The final reading of the evaporative enclosure FID (or 
HFID) analyzer shall be taken 60 

#

5 seconds following the 
disconnect of the refueling nozzle. This is the final hydrocarbon 
concentration, C

HCf

, required in  86.143. The elapsed time, in 
minutes, between the initial and final FID (or HFID) readings shall 
be recorded. 

(6) For vehicles equipped with more than one fuel tank, the 
procedures described in this section shall be performed for each 
fuel tank. 

(e) 

Records required. 

(1) Test: test number, system or 
device tested (brief description), date and time of day, instrument 
operated, operator, enclosure barometric pressure and temperature, 
recorder charts (identify zero, span, and enclosure gas traces), 
fuel dispensing rate(s) and dispensed fuel volume. 

(2) Vehicle: ID number, manufacturer, model year, engine 
family, evaporative/refueling emission family, fuel tank(s) 
capacity, basic fuel system description and odometer reading. 

(3) All pertinent instrument information including nozzle 
and fuel delivery system description. As an alternative, a 
reference to a vehicle test cell number may be used, with advance 
approval of the Administrator, provided test cell calibration 
records show the pertinent instrument information. 

(4) All additional information necessary for the 
calculations specified in paragraph (f) of this section. 

(f) 

Calculations. 

(1) The calculation of the net 
hydrocarbon mass change in the enclosure is used to determine 
refueling mass emissions. The mass is calculated from initial and 
final hydrocarbon concentrations in ppm carbon, initial and final 
enclosure ambient temperatures, initial and final barometric 
pressures and net volume using the equations of  86.143. For 
vehicles with multiple tanks, the results for each tank shall be 
calculated and then summed to determine overall refueling 
emissions. 

(2) The final results for comparison with the refueling 
control emission standard shall be computed by dividing the total 
refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in 
the refueling test (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section). 

(3) The results of all emission tests shall be rounded, in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67 to the number of decimal places 
contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one 
additional significant figure. This procedure has been 
incorporated by reference (see  86.1).

new paragraph (e), to read as follows: 



 86.521-90 

Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. 



* * * * * 



(b) 

Initial and periodic optimization of detector response.

 
Prior to its introduction into service and at least annually 
thereafter, the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for 
optimum hydrocarbon response. Analyzers used with petroleum fuels 
and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel shall be optimized using propane. 
Analyzers used with natural gas-fuel for measurement of 
hydrocarbons shall be optimized using methane. If a single 
analyzer is used for all measurements, it shall be optimized using 
propane and its response factor for methane shall be determined and 
accounted for in measurements of total hydrocarbons from natural 
gas-fuel. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be 
used, if approved in advance by the Administrator. 


* * * * * 



(2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce 
into the analyzer a propane (methane as appropriate) in air mixture 
(methanol in air mixture for methanol-fueled vehicles when optional 
methanol calibrated FID procedure is used during the 1990 through 
1994 model year) with a propane (or methane or methanol as 
appropriate) concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the 
most common operating range. 


* * * * * 



(c) * * * 

(3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with 
propane in air (or methanol or methane in air as appropriate) 
calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 
75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the 
deviation from a least squares best-fit straight line is two 
percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration 
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for 
that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the 
best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within 
two percent of each test point shall be used to determine 
concentration. 


* * * * * 



(e) 

FID response factor to methane.

 When the FID analyzer 
is to be used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled motorcycle 
hydrocarbon samples, the methane response factor of the analyzer 
shall be established. To determine the total hydrocarbon FID 
response to methane, known methane in air concentrations traceable 
to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall be 
analyzed by the FID. Several methane concentrations shall be 
analyzed by the FID in the range of concentrations in the exhaust 
sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response to methane is 
calculated as follows: 




 r

CH4

 = FIDppm/SAMppm 




Where: 




(1) r

CH4

 = FID response factor to methane. 

(2) FIDppm = FID reading in ppmC. 

(3) SAMppm = the known methane concentration in ppmC.

oxides of nitrogen mass emissions while simulating an average trip 
in an urban area. The test consists of engine startups and 
motorcycle operation on a chassis dynamometer, through a specified 
driving schedule. A proportional part of the diluted exhaust 
emissions is collected continuously for subsequent analysis, using 
a constant volume (variable dilution) sampler. 

(d) Except in cases of component malfunction or failure, 
all emission control systems installed on or incorporated in a new 
motorcycle shall be functioning during all procedures in this

87. Section 86.1221-90 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(2) and (b)(3),
and adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: 



 86.1221-90 


Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. 


* * * * * 



(a) 

Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. 

Prior to its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted
for optimum hydrocarbon response. (The HFID used with methanol-fueled vehicles shall be operated at 235
  

#

15
 F (113
  

#

8
 C)). Analyzers used with gasoline-fuel and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel shall be optimized using propane.
Analyzers used with natural gas-fuel may be optimized using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response
to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon reading. Alternate methods yielding equivalent
results may be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator. 


* * * * * 



(2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the analyzer a propane (or methane as appropriate)
in air mixture with a propane (or methane as appropriate) concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most
common operating range. 


* * * * * 



(b) * * * 

(3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in air (or methane in air as appropriate) calibration
gases having nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if
the deviation from a least squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration
values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent
at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent of each test point shall
be used to determine concentration. 


* * * * * 



(e) 

FID response factor to methane. 

When the FID analyzer to be used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled vehicle hydrocarbon samples has been calibrated
using propane, the methane response factor of the analyzer shall be established. To determine the total hydrocarbon
FID response to methane, known methane in air concentrations traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) shall be analyzed by the FID. Several methane concentrations shall be analyzed by the FID in the range of concentrations
in the exhaust sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response to methane is calculated as follows: 



r

CH4

 = FIDppm/SAMppm 


 

Where: 


 

(1) r

CH4

 = FID response factor to methane. 
(2) FIDppm = FID reading in ppmC. 
(3) SAMppm = the known methane concentration in ppmC.

88. Section 86.1227-96 of subpart M is amended by revising the section heading and paragraphs (b) introductory
text and (b)(2) to read as follows: 



 86.1227-96 


Test procedures; overview. 


* * * * * 



(b) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled, and
methanol-fueled vehicles) is designed to determine hydrocarbon and/or methanol evaporative emissions as a consequence
of diurnal temperature fluctuation urban driving and hot soaks during engine-off periods. It is associated with
a series of events representative of heavy-duty vehicle operation, which result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol
vapor losses. The test procedure is designed to measure: 


* * * * * 



(2) Running losses resulting from a simulated trip on a chassis dynamometer, measured by the enclosure or point-source
technique (see  86.1234; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles); and 


* * * * * 



89. Section 86.1230-96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b), to read as follows: 



 86.1230-96 


Test sequence; general requirements. 



(a)(1) 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. 

The test sequence shown in figure M96-1 of this section shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes
the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth. The full three-diurnal
sequence depicted in figure M96-1 tests vehicles for all sources of evaporative emissions. The supplemental
two-diurnal test sequence is designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative canisters during
the dynamometer run. Sections 86.1232-96, 86.1233-96 and 86.1238-96 describe the separate specifications
of the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence. 

(2) 

Gaseous-fueled vehicles. 

The test sequence shown in figure M96-1 of this section shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle undergoes
the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity with the standards set forth, with the exception
that the fuel drain and fill and precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. In addition,
the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running loss test are not required. 

(b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is conducted as a stand-alone test (see  86.1246).
This test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. 


* * * * * 



90. Section 86.1232-96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (f), to read as follows: 



 86.1232-96 


Vehicle preconditioning. 


* * * * * 



(b)(1) 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. 

Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in  86.1213, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined
in  86.082-2. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling. 

(2) 

Gaseous-fueled vehicles. 

Vehicle fuel tanks are to be filled with fuel that meets the specifications in  86.113. Fuel tanks shall be filled
to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume
for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks
already meets the specifications in  86.113. 


* * * * * 



(f)(1) 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. 

Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and
parked. For gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles, drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified
in  86.1213, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in  86.082-2. The vehicle shall be refueled within
one hour of completion of the preconditioning drive. The fuel cap(s) shall be installed within one minute after refueling.


(2) 

Gaseous-fueled vehicles. 

Within five minutes of completion of the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer and
parked. Vehicle fuel tanks shall be refilled with fuel that meets the specifications in  86.113. Fuel tanks
shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available
fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the
fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in  86.113.

91. Section 86.1233-96 of subpart M is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) to read as follows:


 86.1233-96 


Diurnal emission test. 


(a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles 
following the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 
24-hour cycle, with the highest emission level used to determine 
compliance with the standards specified in subpart A of this part. 
The Administrator may truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle 
without affecting the validity of the collected data. Sampling of 
emissions from the running loss and hot soak tests is not required 
as preparation for the diurnal emission test. The diurnal emission 
test may be conducted as part of either the three-diurnal test 
sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, as 
described in  86.1230-96. 


* * * * * 


(3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal 
emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the 
alternate hot soak test specified in  86.1238-96(k). This test is 
not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. 


* * * * *


92. Section 86.1234-96 of subpart M is amended by revising 
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 86.1234-96 


Running loss test. 


(a) 

Overview. 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to 
be tested for running loss emissions during simulated 
high-temperature urban driving; this test is not required for 
gaseous-fueled vehicles. During operation, tank temperatures are 
controlled according to a prescribed profile to simulate in-use 
conditions. If the vehicle is determined to have exceeded the 
standard before the end of the running loss test, the test may be 
terminated without invalidating the data. The test can be run 
either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source method, as 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section. 


* * * * *


93. Section 86.1238-96 of subpart M is amended by revising 
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 86.1238-96 


Hot soak test. 


(a)(1) 

Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. 

For gasoline- 
and methanol-fueled vehicles, the hot soak test shall be conducted 
immediately following the running loss test. However, sampling of 
emissions from the running loss test is not required as preparation 
for the hot soak test. 
(2) 

Gaseous-fueled vehicles.

 Since gaseous-fueled vehicles are 
not required to perform a running loss test, the hot soak test 
shall be conducted within five minutes of the hot start exhaust 
test. 


* * * * *


94. Section 86.1242-90 of subpart M is amended by adding new 
paragraphs (m) and (n) to read as follows:

96. Section 86.1306-90 of subpart N is amended by revising 
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 86.1306-90 


Equipment required and specifications; overview. 


(a) 

Exhaust emission tests. 

All engines subject to this 
subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. Petroleum-fueled, 
natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and 
methanol-fueled, Otto-cycle and diesel engines are tested 
identically with the exception of the systems used to measure 
hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, formaldehyde and 
particulate; petroleum-fueled diesel engines require a heated, 
continuous hydrocarbon detector and a continuous nitrogen oxide 
detector ( 86.1310); methanol-fueled engines require a heated 
hydrocarbon detector, a methanol detector and a formaldehyde 
detector; either a heated or a non-heated continuous hydrocarbon 
detector may be used with natural gas-fueled and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines; gasoline-fueled, natural 
gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled 
Otto-cycle engines are not tested for particulate emissions 
( 86.1309). Necessary equipment and specifications appear in   
86.1308, 86.1309, 86.1310 and 86.1311. 


* * * * *


97. Section 86.1306-96 of subpart N is amended by revising 
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 


 86.1306-96 


Equipment required and specifications; overview. 


(a) 

Exhaust emission tests. 

All engines subject to this 
subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. Petroleum-, natural 
gas-, liquefied petroleum gas-, and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and 
diesel engines are tested identically with two exceptions. First, 
the systems used to measure hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, 
formaldehyde and particulate depend on the type of engine being 
tested; petroleum-fueled diesel engines require a heated, 
continuous hydrocarbon detector and a heated, continuous nitrogen 
oxide detector (see  86.1310); methanol-fueled engines require a 
heated hydrocarbon detector, a methanol detector and a formaldehyde 
detector; either a heated or non-heated continuous hydrocarbon 
detector may be used with natural gas-fueled and liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines; gasoline-fueled, natural gas- 
fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled 
Otto-cycle engines are not tested for particulate emissions (see 
 86.1309). Second, if a gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled engine 
is to be used in a vehicle equipped with an evaporative canister, 
the test engine must have a loaded evaporative canister attached 
for the exhaust emission test. Necessary equipment and 
specifications appear in   86.1308, 86.1309, 86.1310 and 86.1311. 


* * * * *


98. Section 86.1309-90 of subpart N is amended by revising the 
section heading and paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(4) to read as 
follows: 


 86.1309-90 


Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle engines. 


(a)(1) 

General. 

The exhaust gas sampling system described 
in this paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous 
emissions in the exhaust of either gasoline-fueled, natural 
gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled 
Otto-cycle engines. In the CVS concept of measuring mass 
emissions, two conditions must be satisfied; the total volume of 
the mixture of exhaust and dilution air must be measured, and a 
continuously proportioned volume of sample must be collected for 
analysis. Mass emissions are determined from the sample 
concentration and total flow over the test period. 


* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to 
eliminate water condensation in the system. This is especially 
critical in the case of methanol-fueled engines and may also be of 
concern with natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled 
engines; see ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using 
Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009.

99. Section 86.1310-90 of subpart N is amended by revising the section heading and paragraphs (a) introductory
text and (a)(2) to read as follows: 



 86.1310-90 


Exhaust gas sampling and analytical system; and methanol-fueled diesel engines. 



(a) 

General.

 The exhaust gas sampling system described in this paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and
particulate emissions in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled
and methanol-fueled heavy-duty diesel engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept (described in  86.1309)
of measuring mass emissions of HC, CH

3

OH and HCHO (methanol-fueled engines), CO, CO

2

, and particulate from all fuel types. A continuously integrated system is required for HC (petroleum-fueled, natural
gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines) and NO

X

 (petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled engines) measurement,
and is allowed for all CO and CO

2

 measurements plus CH

3

OH, HCHO and HC from methanol-fueled engines. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration
and total flow over the test period. The mass of particulate emissions is determined from a proportional mass sample
collected on a filter and from the sample flow and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total
fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO

2

. General requirements are as follows: 



* * * * * *



(2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled diesel engines requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID)
and heated sample system (375 

#

20
 F (191 

#

11
 C)). For natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines either a heated flame ionization
detector and heated sample system as required for petroleum fuel or a non-heated flame ionization detector may be
used. 



* * * * * *



100. A new section 86.1311-94 is added to subpart N to read as follows: 



 86.1311-94 


Exhaust gas analytical system; CVS bag sample. 



(a) 

Schematic drawings.

 Figure N94-1 is a schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical system used for analyzing CVS bag samples from
either Otto-cycle or diesel engines. Since various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance
with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components
such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based
upon good engineering judgment. 

(b) 

Major component description. 

The analytical system, Figure N94-1, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) (heated for methanol-fueled
(235 

#

15
 F (113 

#

8
 C)) and for petroleum-fueled diesel (375 

#

10
 F (191 

#

6
 C) engines) for the measurement of hydrocarbons, a methane analyzer (consisting of a gas chromatograph combined
with a FID) for the determination of CH

4

 (for engines subject to NMHC standards, where applicable), nondispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the measurement
of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a chemiluminescence analyzer (CL) for the measurement of oxides of nitrogen.
The analytical system for methanol consists of a gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a flame ionization detector.
The analysis for formaldehyde is performed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
(DNPH) derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) detection. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the following
requirements: 

(1) The CL requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other
types of analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.


(2) The carbon monoxide (NDIR) analyzer may require a sample conditioning column containing CaSO

4

, or desiccating silica gel to remove water vapor, and containing ascarite to remove carbon dioxide from the CO analysis
stream. 

(i) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of CO

2

 and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning column may be deleted (see   86.1322 and 86.1342).


(ii) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of CO

2

 and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of three percent CO

2

 in N

2

, which has been bubbled through water at room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the
most sensitive CO range, which is less than one percent of full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale
or less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale (see  86.1322).

 86.1321-94 



Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration. 



The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the following initial and periodic calibration. The HFID used with petroleum-fueled,
natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines shall be operated to a set point 

#

10 
 F (

#

5.5 
 C) between 365 and 385 
 F (185 and 197 
 C). The HFID used with methanol-fueled engines shall be operated at 235 

#

15 
 F (113 

#

8 
 C). 

(a) 

Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. 

Prior to introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted
for optimum hydrocarbon response. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if approved in advance
by the Administrator. 

(1) Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start-up and basic operating adjustment using the
appropriate fuel (see  86.1314) and zero-grade air. 

(2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the analyzer a propane-in-air mixture with a propane
concentration equal to approximately 90 percent of the most common operating range. 

(3) One of the following procedures is required for FID or HFID optimization: 

(i) The procedures outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) paper number 770141, ``Optimization of Flame
Ionization Detector for Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust''; author, Glenn D. Reschke.
Available from Society of Automotive Engineers International, 400 Commonwealth Dr., Warrendale, PA 15096-0001.


(ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in subpart D of this part. 

(iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. 

(4) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, they are recorded for future reference. 

(b) 

Initial and periodic calibration. 

Prior to introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be calibrated
on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate and pressures as when analyzing samples. Calibration
gases shall be introduced directly at the analyzer, unless the ``overflow'' calibration option of  86.1310(b)(3)(i)
for the HFID is taken. 

(1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance. 

(2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air. 

(3) Calibrate on each used operating range with propane-in-air calibration gases having nominal concentrations
of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit
straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of
a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear
equation which represents the data to within two percent of each test point shall be used to determine concentration.


(c) 

FID response factor to methanol. 

When the FID analyzer is to be used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the methanol response
factor of the analyzer shall be established. The methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations
in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample. 

(1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure N90-10.
A known volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the heated mixing zone (250 
 F (121 
 C)) of the apparatus. The methanol is vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume of zero-grade
air measured by a dry gas meter. 

(2) The bag sample is analyzed using the FID. 

(3) The FID response factor, r, is calculated as follows: 




r=FIDppm/SAMppm 




Where: 




(i) r=FID response factor. 

(ii) FIDppm=FID reading in ppmC. 

(iii) SAMppm=methanol concentration in the sample bag in ppmC.

(d) 

FID response factor to methane. 

When the FID analyzer is 
to be used for the analysis of natural gas-fueled vehicle 
hydrocarbon samples, the methane response factor of the analyzer 
shall be established. To determine the total hydrocarbon FID 
response to methane, known methane in air concentrations traceable 
to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shall be 
analyzed by the FID. Several methane concentrations shall be 
analyzed by the FID in the range of concentrations in the exhaust 
sample. The total hydrocarbon FID response to methane is 
calculated as follows: 




r

CH4

=FIDppm/SAMppm 




 Where: 




(1) r

Methane analyzer calibration. 



Prior to introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the 
methane analyzer shall be calibrated: 

(a) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument 
startup and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize 
performance. 

(b) Zero the methane analyzer with zero-grade air. 

(c) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with CH

4

 in 
air with nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 
percent of that range. Additional calibration points may be 
generated. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a 
least-squares best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the 
value at each data point, concentration values may be calculated by 
use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the 
deviation exceeds two percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear 
equation which represents the data to within two percent of each 
test point shall be used to determine concentration. 

106. A new section 86.1327-94 is added to subpart N to read as

Engine dynamometer test procedures; overview. 



 (a) The engine dynamometer test procedure is designed to 
determine the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons, nonmethane 
hydrocarbons (for natural gas-fueled engines only), carbon 
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate (petroleum-fueled, 
natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and 
methanol-fueled diesel engines), and methanol and formaldehyde (for 
methanol-fueled diesel engines). The test procedure consists of a 
``cold'' start test following either natural or forced cool-down 
periods described in   86.1334 and 86.1335, respectively. A ``hot'' 
start test follows the ``cold'' start test after a hot soak of 20 
minutes. The idle test of Subpart P may be run after the ``hot'' 
start test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and 
a continuous proportional sample is collected for analysis during 
both the cold- and hot-start tests. The composite samples 
collected are analyzed either in bags or continuously for 
hydrocarbons (HC), methane (CH

4

_for natural gas-fueled engines 
only), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO

2

), and oxides of 
nitrogen (NO

X

), or in sample collection impingers for methanol 
(CH

3

OH) and sample collection impingers (or capsules) for 
formaldehyde (HCHO). Measurement of CH

3

OH and HCHO may be omitted 
for 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled engines when a FID 
calibrated on methanol is used. A bag or continuous sample of the 
dilution air is similarly analyzed for background levels of 
hydrocarbon, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxides of 
nitrogen and, if appropriate, methanol and formaldehyde. In 
addition, for petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines, 
particulates are collected on fluorocarbon-coated glass fiber 
filters or fluorocarbon-based (membrane) filters, and the dilution 
air may be prefiltered. 

(b) Engine torque and rpm shall be recorded continuously during 
both the cold- and hot-start tests. Data points shall be recorded 
at least once every second. 

(c) Using the torque and rpm feedback signals the brake 
horsepower is integrated with respect to time for the cold and hot 
cycles. This produces a brake horsepower-hour value that enables 
the brake-specific emissions to be determined (see  86.1342, 
Calculations, gaseous exhaust emissions; and  86.1343, 
Calculations, particulate exhaust emissions). 

(d)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions or is 
operated for service accumulation on an engine dynamometer, the 
complete engine shall be tested, with all emission control devices 
installed and functioning.

(2) Evaporative emission controls need not be connected if data 
are provided to show that normal operating conditions are 
maintained in the engine induction system. 

(3) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.

e.g., 

oil cooler, alternators, air 
compressors, etc.) may be installed or their loading simulated if 
typical of the in-use application. 

(5) The engine may be equipped with a production type starter. 

(e) Means of engine cooling which will maintain the engine 
operating temperatures (

e.g., 

temperatures of intake air, oil, 
water, etc.) at approximately the same temperature as specified by 
the manufacturer shall be used. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to 
maintain engine cooling during operation on the dynamometer. Rust 
inhibitors and lubrication additives may be used, up to the levels 
recommended by the additive manufacturer. Antifreeze mixtures and 
other coolants typical of those approved for use by the 
manufacturer may be used. 

(f) 

Exhaust system. 

The exhaust system shall meet the 
following requirements: 

(1) 

Otto-cycle engines. 

A chassis-type exhaust system shall 
be used. For all catalyst systems, the distance from the exhaust 
manifold flange(s) to the catalyst shall be the same as in the 
vehicle configuration unless the manufacturer provides data showing 
equivalent performance at another location. 

(2) 

Diesel engines. 

Either a chassis-type or a facility-type 
exhaust system or both systems simultaneously may be used. The 
exhaust backpressure or restriction shall be typical of those seen 
in the actual average vehicle exhaust system configuration and may 
be set with a valve (muffler omitted). 

(i) The engine exhaust system shall meet the following 
requirements: 

(A) The total length of the tubing from the exit of the engine 
exhaust manifold or turbocharger outlet to the primary dilution 
tunnel should not exceed 32 feet (9.8 m). 

(B) The initial portion of the exhaust system may consist of 
a typical in-use (

i.e., 

length, diameter, material, etc.) 
chassis-type exhaust system. 

(C) The distance from the exhaust manifold flange(s) to any 
exhaust aftertreatment device shall be the same as in the vehicle 
configuration unless the manufacturer is able to demonstrate 
equivalent performance at another location. 

(D) If the exhaust system tubing from the exit of the engine 
exhaust manifold or turbocharger outlet to the primary dilution 
tunnel exceeds 12 feet (3.7 m) in length, then all tubing in excess 
of 12 feet (3.7 m) (chassis and/or facility type) shall be 
insulated. 

(E) If the tubing is required to be insulated, the radial 
thickness of the insulation must be at least 1.0 inch. The thermal 
conductivity of the insulating material must have a value no 
greater than 0.75 BTU_in/hr/ft

2

/
 F measured at 700
 F. 

(F) A smoke meter or other instrumentation may be inserted into 
the exhaust system tubing. If this option is exercised in the 
insulated portion of the tubing, then a minimal amount of tubing 
not to exceed 18 inches may be left uninsulated. However, no more 
than 12 feet of tubing can be left uninsulated in total, including 
the length at the smoke meter. 

(ii) The facility-type exhaust system shall meet the following 
requirements: 

(A) It must be composed of smooth tubing made of typical in-use 
steel or stainless steel. This tubing shall have a maximum inside 
diameter of 6.0 in (15 cm). 

(B) Short sections (altogether not to exceed 20 percent of the 
entire tube length) of flexible tubing at connection points are 
allowed.

Engine dynamometer test run. 




(a) * * * 

(7) For diesel engines tested for particulate emissions, 
carefully install a clean particulate sample filter into each of 
the filter holders and install the assembled filter holders in the 
sample flow line (filter holders may be preassembled). 

(8) Follow the manufacturers choke and throttle instructions 
for cold starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin 
exhaust and dilution air sampling. For petroleum-fueled diesel 
engines (and natural gas-fueled, liquified petroleum gas-fueled or 
methanol-fueled diesels, if used), turn on the hydrocarbon and NO

X

 (and CO and CO

2

, if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if 
used), and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the 
start of the test on the data collection medium. 


* * * * * 



(13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the 
engine cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect 
the exhaust system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer 
the ``cold start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples 
according to  86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample 
on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end of 
the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis of the methanol 
and formaldehyde samples shall be obtained within 24 hours of the 
end of the sample collection period. For diesel engines tested for 
particulate, carefully remove the filter holder from the sample 
flow apparatus, remove each particulate sample filter from its 
holder and place each in a petri dish and cover. 


* * * * * 



(20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully 
install a clean particulate filter in each of the filter holders 
and install assembled filter holders in the sample flow line 
(filter holders may be preassembled). 


* * * * * 



(26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust 
and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and process 
the samples according to  86.1340. A stabilized reading of the 
exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes 
of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples within 24 hours. (If it is not 
possible to perform analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be 
stored in a cold (approximately 0
 C) dark environment until 
analysis can be performed). For diesel engines tested for 
particulate, carefully remove the assembled filter holder from the 
sample flow lines and remove each particulate sample filter from 
its holder and place in a clean petri dish and cover as soon as 
possible. Within one hour after the end of the hot start phase of 
the test, transfer the four particulate filters to the weighing 
chamber for post-test conditioning.

, if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if used), and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the
start of the test on the data collection medium. 


* * * * *


(13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the engine cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect
the exhaust system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer the ``cold start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag
samples according to  86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained
within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis of the methanol and formaldehyde samples
shall be obtained within 24 hours of the end of the sample collection period. For diesel engines tested for particulate,
carefully remove the filter holder from the sample flow apparatus, remove each particulate sample filter from its
holder and place each in a petri dish and cover. 


* * * * *


(20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully install a clean particulate filter in each of the filter
holders and install assembled filter holders in the sample flow line (filter holders may be preassembled). 


* * * * *


(26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system
and process the samples according to  86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall
be obtained within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the methanol and formaldehyde
samples within 24 hours. (If it is not possible to perform analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in
a cold (approximately 0
 C) dark environment until analysis can be performed). For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully
remove the assembled filter holder from the sample flow lines, remove each particulate sample filter from its holder,
place in a clean petri dish and cover as soon as possible. Within one hour after the end of the hot start phase of the test,
transfer the four particulate filters to the weighing chamber for post-test conditioning.
