ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC-8-100 and -300 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to verify
the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the electronic engine control (EEC), and correction of
any discrepancy. This proposal also would require measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds,
and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike, due
to several shields for the cable harness of the EEC not being properly grounded to the airframe. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to insufficient protection of the EEC.

Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-127-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion 


On April 25, 1989, the FAA issued AD 85-14-51 R2, amendment 39-6207 (54 FR 19875, May 9, 1989), which
is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes. That AD requires revising the
Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit takeoff, landing, and climb in
the vicinity of lightning or thunderstorms; and to require continuous ignition operation during takeoffs, takeoff
climb to 1500 feet above ground level, final approach, and landing within 5 nautical miles of lightning and thunderstorms.
That AD also requires the installation of four modifications designed to protect the electronic engine control (EEC)
from the effects of lightning strike, which, when accomplished, terminates the requirements of that AD and allows
for the removal of the AFM limitations. 
Since issuance of that AD, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has advised
the FAA of a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike on a Model DHC-8 series airplane. Modifications
required by AD 85-14-51 R2 had been accomplished on that airplane. Investigation revealed that the engine
flameout occurred because several shields for the cable harness of the EEC were not properly grounded to the airframe.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in insufficient protection of the EEC and may lead to an engine flameout
following a lightning strike. 
Bombardier has issued Service Bulletins S.B. 8-73-18 (for Model DHC-8-100 series airplanes)
and S.B. 8-73-19 (for Model DHC-8-300 series airplanes), both dated April 29, 1994, which
describe procedures for a visual inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of
the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. The service bulletins also describe procedures for measurement of the
electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The repair procedures consist of ensuring
that the metal overbraid (which provides lightning protection for the EEC cable harness) is electrically bonded
to the connector and the electrical receptacles are electrically bonded to the airframe. Transport Canada Aviation
classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF-94-09,
dated May 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a visual inspection to verify the integrity
of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. This AD also would require
measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.

The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $124,080, or $880
per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Santa Barbara
County Air Pollution Control District 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The revision concerns
the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) from industrial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters in Santa Barbara County. The rule limits NO

x

 and carbon monoxide emissions from these sources. The intended effect of proposing approval of this rule is to regulate
emissions of NO

x

 in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this
notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated this
rule and is proposing to approve it under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, SIPs for national
primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Background



On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO

x

 emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November
25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General
Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO

x

 Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, document should be referred
to for further information on the NO

x

 requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. 
Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO

x

 (``major'' as defined in sections 302 and 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. Santa Barbara County is classified as
a moderate nonattainment area for ozone;

1

 therefore the Santa Barbara County area is subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above. 





Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by
a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15,
1992. There were no NO

x

 CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO

x

 category since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO

x

 sources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NO

x

 controls by May 31, 1995 for those sources where installation by that date is practicable. 
This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD)
Rule 342, Control of NO

x

 from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters. The rule was adopted by the SBCAPCD on March 10, 1992 and submitted
by the State of California on June 19, 1992. Submitted Rule 342 was found to be complete on August 27, 1992 pursuant to
EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V

2

 and is being proposed for approval into the SIP.





NO

x

 emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. Rule 342 controls emissions of NO

x

 and carbon monoxide from commercial and industrial boilers, steam generators, and process heaters which are used
in a wide variety of applications providing steam, heat, and hot water for industrial, institutional, and commercial
operations. Rule 342 was adopted as part of SBCAPCD's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for ozone and in response to the CAA requirements cited above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed
action for Rule 342. 


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action


In determining the approvability of a NO

x

 rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section
110, and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation
Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in the NO

x

 Supplement and various EPA policy guidance documents.

3

 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO

x

 rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO

x

 emissions.





For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO

x

 RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO

x

 Supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO

x

 Supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT will be determined for stationary sources of NO

x

 emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed
towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO

x

 (see section 4.5 of the NO

x

 Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control technique documents (ACTs)
that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO

x

. The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential
to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO

x

. However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO

x

. In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have
been set forth to ensure that submitted NO

x

 RACT rules meet Federal RACT requirements and are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
Rule 342 applies to all boilers, steam generators, and process heaters with rated heat inputs greater than or equal
to 5 million British Thermal Units per hour (MMBtu/hr) used in industrial, institutional, and commercial operations.
The rule limits NO

x

 emissions from units with rated heat inputs greater than or equal to 5 MMBtu/hr and with annual heat input greater than
or equal to 9 billion Btu to 30 parts per million (ppm) or 0.036 pound per million BTU (lb/MMBtu) when operated on gas.
For the same size units with annual heat inputs of the same level, which are operated on nongaseous fuel, the rule limits
NO

x

 emissions to 40ppm or 0.052 lb/MMBtu of heat input. The same size units operating with annual heat inputs of less than
9 billion Btu are required to maintain stack-gas oxygen concentrations at less than 3 percent or perform annual tune-ups.
Final compliance with these limits is required by March 10, 1996. The RACT limits specified in the California Air Resources
Board's (CARB's) reasonably available control technology/best available retrofit control technology (RACT/BARCT)
determination for these types of units are 70 ppm (0.084 lb/MMBtu) and 115 ppm (0.150 lb/MMBtu) for units fired with
gas and nongaseous fuels while those for BARCT are 30 ppm and 40 ppm, respectively. Although Rule 342's BARCT limits
(30ppm/40ppm) are more stringent than what EPA would consider as RACT (70ppm/115ppm) for these sources, the additional
reductions obtained beyond those attributable to RACT are assumed necessary for SBCAPCD's attainment planning
purposes. 
In evaluating the rule, EPA must also determine whether the CAA requirement for RACT implementation by May 31, 1995
is met. The rule was written such that final compliance is not required until 4 years after the date of adoption. Since
the rule was adopted in March 1992, final compliance is not required until March 1996. Under certain circumstances,
the determination of what constitutes RACT could include consideration of advanced control technologies, i.e.,
California's requirement for BARCT. In these cases, the CAA's May 1995 date for RACT implementation may be satisfied
in BARCT rules that establish ``interim RACT'' by May 1995, and require emission limitations based on advanced control
technologies (BARCT) be met after May 1995. Rule 342 requires that interim control measures be met to ensure progress
toward final compliance. The interim control measures include applying for a permit to operate and authority to construct
and the development and submission of a compliance plan. A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the
controls required, and the justification for why these controls represent RACT can be found in the Technical Support
Document (TSD) for Rule 342, dated May 1994.
EPA has evaluated the submitted rule and has determined that it is consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA
policy. Therefore, SBCAPCD Rule 342, Control of NO

x

 from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters is being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the
CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting
or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each
request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new 
requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the
nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry 
into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing full approval of revisions to the respective State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for the following
four States: Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Revisions to the SIP were submitted by each of these four
States to implement an emission statement program for stationary sources throughout the State. Connecticut submitted
section 22a-174-4(c)(1), ``Recordkeeping and Reporting,'' and amendments to the SIP narrative entitled
``Revision to State Implementation Plan for Air Quality Emission Statements'' on January 12, 1993. On January 3,
1994, Maine submitted Chapter 137, ``Emission Statements'' and amendments to Chapter 100, ``Definitions.'' Rhode
Island submitted amendments to Regulation Number 14 entitled ``Record Keeping and Reporting'' on January 12, 1993.
On August 9, 1993, Vermont submitted a rule entitled ``Registration of Air Contaminant Sources,'' Sections 5-801
through 5-806, and a SIP Narrative, ``State of Vermont Air Quality Implementation Plan, February 1993.'' These
SIP revisions were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program
as part of the SIP.




COMMENTS:

 Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on US EPA's proposal to approve.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport
areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA
intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for
ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation
of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''),
and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this Notice, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency
is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission statement
program.

Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other classified ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program
in paragraph (3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements
showing actual emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. This paragraph provides that the States
are to submit a revision to their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by November 15, 1992 establishing this emission
statement program. 
Section 184(b)(2) of the Act extends the requirements for major stationary sources in moderate ozone nonattainment
areas to sources in the ozone transport region which emit, or have the potential to emit, 50 tpy or more of VOC. Section
182(f) extends the requirements for major stationary sources of VOC in ozone transport regions to major sources of
NO

X

. For areas designated as attainment or nonattainment areas which are not classified, section 182(f) refers to section
302 where the major source definition for NO

X

 is the potential to emit 100 tons per year. Therefore, the emission statement requirement includes sources in attainment
areas and nonattainment areas which are not classified within ozone transport regions which emit, or have the potential
to emit 100 tpy or more of NO

X

 or 50 tpy or more of VOC. 
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine are each located in the ozone transport region. The applicability
of these States' emission statement regulations must be State-wide, and cover all stationary sources which emit
or have the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC or 100 tpy of NO

X

. In addition, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the following counties of Maine: Androscoggin, Cumberland, Hancock,
Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Waldo, and York are classified ozone nonattainment areas and are therefore
subject to the more stringent source threshold requirement of section 182(a)(3)(B). For these classified ozone
nonattainment areas, the source threshold of these States' emission statement regulations must cover all sources
which emit VOC or NO

X

. 
For classified ozone nonattainment areas, the States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission
statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

X

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island have provided 1990 baseyear inventories
which include emissions from sources that emit below 25 tpy of VOC or NO

X

 emissions and will be updating these inventories every three years until the area is redesignated to attainment.
In addition, the methods and emission factors used by Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island to calculate emissions
for the 1990 baseyear inventory have been reviewed by EPA. As a result, EPA finds the 25 tpy threshold acceptable. 
Additionally, if either VOC or NO

X

 is emitted at or above the statutory reporting level, the other pollutant must be included in the emission statement,
even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. 
The CAA requires that States' rules specify that facilities must submit the first emission statement to the State
within three years after November 15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission
data to EPA through the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should
include: certification of data accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information
(including annual and typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA
developed emission statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements.
This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation
of all EPA reporting requirements. 


II. Analysis of State Submission 


A. Procedural Background 


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Section 110(l)(2) of the Act provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted
by a State under the CAA must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA must at the outset
determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1)
and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as
amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). 
Connecticut held public hearings on the proposed changes to the SIP narrative on January 5, 6, and 7, 1993. Following
the public hearing, Connecticut submitted the SIP revision to EPA on January 12, 1993. The SIP revision was reviewed
by EPA and deemed complete on March 16, 1993. The State of Maine held a public hearing on Chapter 137 and amendments to
Chapter 100 on July 14, 1993. Following the public hearing, the regulations were adopted by the State on November 10,
1993 and submitted to EPA on January 3, 1994. EPA deemed the submittal complete on February 16, 1994. Rhode Island held
a public hearing on Regulation 14, ``Record Keeping and Reporting'' on December 16, 1992. The regulation was adopted
by the State on January 11, 1993. EPA received the submittal on January 12, 1993 and deemed the SIP revision complete
in a March 9, 1993 letter. The State of Vermont held a public hearing on the proposed changes to the SIP narrative on March
10, 1993. Vermont submitted the SIP narrative and regulations 5-801 through 5-806 to EPA on August 10,
1993. On October 25, 1993, EPA deemed the submittal complete.

EPA proposes to approve the emission statement program SIP submittals of Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont
and invites public comment on the action. 


B. Components of the Emission Statement Program 


There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. 


1. SIP Revision Submission 


EPA requires States to submit their SIP revision within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(CAAA) (November 15, 1990). 
Connecticut and Rhode Island submitted their SIP revisions on January 12, 1993. Maine and Vermont were each notified
in a letter dated January 15, 1993 that a finding of failure to submit a SIP for Emission Statements was made. Vermont
submitted its SIP revision on August 9, 1993, and Maine submitted its SIP revision on January 3, 1994. EPA reviewed
these two submittals and, as outlined above, found them complete. Therefore, the sanctions clock was stopped for
this plan element for each of these states. However, the January 15, 1993 finding also triggered the Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) clock. EPA remains obligated to promulgate a FIP until a final rulemaking action to approve these two SIP
revisions is taken. 


2. Reporting Requirements for State 


In addition to the program elements applying to sources, the SIP should include a provision that States provide to
EPA the identifying information for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness
utilized by the State in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission
statement status reports. The minimum source identification information should include the AIRS code, the AFS point
number (ID), the AFS segment number (ID), and the Source Category Code (SCC) and descriptions for each segment. 
In addition, States should supply to EPA the current rule effectiveness (RE) factors at the SCC pollutant level, if
applicable, and the RE method codes. The emission statement data submittal to AIRS should include all data obtained
from the source and the State. These source-supplied data elements include source identification information (name,
physical location, mailing address of the facility, latitude and longitude, and 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code(s)), operating schedule information (percentage annual throughput, days per week on the normal operating
schedule, hours per day during the normal operating schedule, and hours per year on the normal operating schedule),
process rate data (annual process rate (annual throughput) and peak ozone season daily process rate), control equipment
information (current primary and secondary control equipment identification codes and current combined control
equipment efficiency (%)), and emissions information (estimated actual VOC and NO

X

 emissions at the segment level (in tons per year for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season
day), estimated emissions method code, calendar year for the emissions, and emission factor (if used)). EPA recommends
that the States electronically submit emission statement data into the AIRS database no later than July 1 of each year,
commencing in 1993. The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission
statements program requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Quarterly reports
should be submitted commencing no later than July 1, 1993. Connecticut commits to submitting data along with supplemental
data to EPA by July 1. All the EPA required data elements will be covered. EPA will negotiate with Connecticut to include
a requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants. 
Maine covers all the EPA required data elements. Maine has not committed to a data submittal date to EPA. Maine will
not meet the present July 1 deadline of submitting data to EPA. Maine will, however, have plenty of time to meet the deadline
of November 15 being proposed by the Emission Statement Workgroup. EPA will negotiate with Maine to include a requirement
for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants. 
Rhode Island's rule has covered all the EPA required data elements. Rhode Island has not committed to submitting emission
statement data to EPA by July 1. EPA will negotiate with Rhode Island to include a requirement for quarterly emission
statement reports in future 105 grants. 
Vermont has committed to report all the necessary data elements to EPA by July 1 of each calendar year. Vermont states
in its SIP narrative that for any emissions estimates which depend on rule enforcement for control of potential emissions,
rule effectiveness will also be included in the submittal to EPA. EPA will negotiate with Vermont to include a requirement
for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants.

3. Sources Covered


Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone require emission statement
data from all sources of VOC or NO

X

 in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all classified ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of
the classification (Marginal, Moderate, etc.). Section 184(b)(2) of the Act extends the requirements for major
stationary sources in moderate ozone nonattainment areas to sources in the ozone transport region. Section 182(f)
extends the requirements for major stationary sources of VOC in ozone transport regions to major sources of NO

X

. Therefore, the emission statement requirement encompasses all stationary sources in all classified nonattainment
areas, as well as sources in attainment areas and unclassified nonattainment areas within ozone transport regions,
which emit or have the potential to emit 100 tpy or more of NO

X

 or 50 tpy or more of VOC.
The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

X

 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories.
Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island emission statement regulations have exempted sources with VOC and NO

X

 emissions below 25 tpy from emission statement requirements. Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island have provided
1990 baseyear inventories which include emissions from sources that emit below 25 tpy of VOC or NO

X

 emissions and will be updating these inventories every three years until the area is redesignated to attainment.
In addition, the methods and emission factors used by Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island to calculate emissions
for the 1990 baseyear inventory have been reviewed by EPA. As a result, EPA finds the 25 tpy threshold acceptable.
The entire state of Connecticut is designated as nonattainment for ozone and is located within the boundaries of the
ozone transport region. Connecticut's SIP narrative describes how for the first reporting year (1993), Connecticut
will require an emission statement from each company whose actual 
'calendar year 1992 emissions from all sources at a plant site total 25 tons per year or more of VOC, NO

X

, or CO. For the second reporting year (1994), the state will lower the reporting threshold to 5 tons per year or more
of VOC, NO

X

, or CO. For the third (1995) and future reporting years, the state will expand the reporting requirement to 5 tons per
year or more of any criteria pollutant (PM10, SO

X

, NO

X

, CO, VOC, Pb). If the 25 tpy (first year) or 5 tpy (later years) threshold is exceeded by any one pollutant, the company
is required to supply data for all remaining pollutants addressed by the respective threshold criteria.
The entire state of Maine is located within the boundaries of the ozone transport region. In addition, the following
counties of Maine: Androscoggin, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Waldo, and York are
classified ozone nonattainment areas and are therefore subject to the more stringent source threshold requirement
of section 182(a)(3)(B). For these classified ozone nonattainment areas, EPA requires Maine's emission statement
regulations to cover all sources which emit VOC or NO

X

 unless the State waives requirements from sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO

X

 or VOC emissions. Maine's Chapter 137 is applicable to all stationary sources which emit, or have the potential to
emit into the ambient air, the following air pollutants at or above the minimum required reporting level:



1. Carbon Monoxide, 100 tpy
2. Sulfur Dioxide, 40 tpy
3. Volatile organic compounds, 25 tpy
4. Nitrogen oxides, 25 tpy
5. Fine Particulate Matter, 15 tpy
6. Lead, 0.1 tpy



In addition, this rule requires the reporting of 189 hazardous air pollutants identified by the CAA and other compounds
known to be emitted in Maine that are of concern to human health. The list of pollutants can be found in Section 1(C) and
Appendix A of Chapter 137. If any one pollutant as specified above is emitted at or above the minimum required reporting
level, all the other pollutant data listed must be collected and reported.
The entire state of Rhode Island is designated as nonattainment for ozone and is located within the boundaries of the
ozone transport region. Section 14.3.1 states that the owner or operator of any facility emitting VOC or NO

X

 which has or has had actual facility-wide emissions of 25 tons per year or more of either pollutant in 1990 or any year
thereafter, shall submit annually an emission statement which includes both pollutants in accordance with the requirements
of section 14.3.2. A facility may apply to the Division to be allowed to discontinue submitting annual emission statements
if actual emissions at that facility decrease to below 10 tons per year as a result of a permanent process change.
Although the entire state of Vermont is in attainment it is located within the ozone transport boundaries. EPA requires
Vermont to regulate source which emit, or have the potential to emit 100 tpy or more of NO

X

 or 50 tpy or more of VOC. Regulation 5-802 requires submittal of complete data from all sources of the five criteria
pollutants which have actually emitted more than 5 tons of all of the criteria pollutants combined during the previous
year.


4. Reporting Requirements for Sources


Sources covered by the State emission statement program will submit, at a minimum, the data elements described under
section II.B.2. of this document.
The emission statement submitted by the source should contain a certification that the information is accurate to
the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. EPA recommends that the State program require the
submission of the data from the sources no later than April 15 of each year.
Connecticut has required, in its SIP narrative, that sources submit their emission statement data no later than April
15 of each year. The emission statement forms sent out by DEP require all data elements described under section II.B.2.
of this document. Along with the forms, a letter is sent which informs the source that accuracy of the data must be certified.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940921-1-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940921-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Maine's Chapter 137 requires the owner or operator of any facility meeting the applicability requirements in section
1 of chapter 137 to submit an emission statement to the Department on an annual basis. The emission statement must be
submitted no later than July 1 for the previous calendar year, beginning no later than July 1, 1994 for the calendar
year 1993. EPA is proposing to approve this submittal date since the Emission Statement Workgroup is proposing to
require States to submit emission statement data to AIRS by November 15 rather than July 1. Maine will have sufficient
time to submit data to AIRS by November 15 if sources submit emission statements by July 1. Chapter 137 also includes
a list of data elements required by the sources and the demand for certification of the data's accuracy.
Rhode Island's section 14.3.1 requires facilities to submit emission statements to the Director within 45 days of
the end of the calendar year. Emission statements shall be submitted for the calendar year 1992 and for every year thereafter.
Rhode Island requires each facility subject to section 14.3.1 to submit an emission statement in a format approved
by the Director which contains all data elements described above and certification that the information contained
in the emission statement is accurate.
Vermont's rule, section 5-803, requires sources to submit to the Air Pollution Control Officer source emissions
data and other information on or before February 1 of each year. Certification of the data is required.


5. Reporting Forms


Although EPA has developed a proposed format for the emission statement reporting process in its guidance document,
the Act allows States to develop their own format for emission statement reporting.
Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont provide the sources with emission statement forms. Connecticut and Vermont included
the forms with their SIP submittals. Rhode Island does not provide sources with an emission statement form; each facility
subject to emission statement requirements must submit an emission statement in a format approved by the Director.


III. Proposed Action


EPA has evaluated the States submittals for consistency with the Clean Air Act, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. EPA
has determined that the proposed rules meet the Clean Air Act's requirements and is proposing approval of the following
rules under section 110(k)(3): Connecticut's section 22a-174-4(c)(1), ``Recordkeeping and Reporting;''
Rhode Island's regulation Number 14 entitled ``Record Keeping and Reporting;'' Vermont's rule entitled ``Registration
of Air Contaminant Sources,'' Sections 5-801 through 5-806; Maine's Chapter 137, ``Emission Statements''
and amendments to Chapter 100, ``Definitions;'' and the SIP narrative revisions of Connecticut entitled ``Revision
to State Implementation Plan for Air Quality Emission Statements,'' and Vermont entitled ``State of Vermont Air
Quality Implementation Plan, February 1993.'' Based upon EPA's evaluation of Connecticut's and Rhode Island's
January 12, 1993 submittals, Vermont's August 9, 1993 submittal, and Maine's January 3, 1994 submittal, EPA is proposing
to approve the emission statement submissions as revisions to the ozone SIP.


IV. Request for Public Comments


Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on EPA's proposal to approve. Public comments received
by October 21, 1994, will be considered in the development of EPA's final rulemaking action.


V. Administrative Requirements


A. Executive Order (EO) 12866


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989. 54 FR 2214-2225. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions, 54 FR 2222, from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on US EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.


B. Regulatory Flexibility


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities.
Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

ACTION:

 Notice of open meeting. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 There will be a two-day meeting of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Scientific Advisory
Panel (SAP) to review a set of scientific issues being considered by the Agency in connection with a draft proposal
rule for 40 CFR part 158, Pesticide Registration Data Requirements. Much of this proposed rule would implement changes
in practice already made by the Office of Pesticide Programs in the course of registration and reregistration. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The agenda for the meeting will follow the general organization of part 158, specifically addressing the changes
and additions. The proposed changes to part 158 reflect increasing emphasis on health and environmental concerns
from the use of pesticides in the areas of exposure to workers and handlers, neurotoxicity, ground water contamination,
and ecological effects. They also reflect concerns about pesticide exposure to infants and children. These revisions
would ensure that comprehensive data packages are supplied to EPA so that each pesticide can be evaluated using current
health and environmental standards. 



Any member of the public wishing to submit written comments should contact Robert B. Jaeger at the address or the phone
number given above to be sure that the meeting is still scheduled and to confirm the Panel's agenda. Interested persons
are permitted to file written statements before the meeting. To the extent that time permits and upon advance notice
to the Designated Federal Official, interested persons may be permitted by the chairman of the Scientific Advisory
Panel to present oral statements at the meeting. There is no limit on written comments for consideration by the Panel,
but oral statements before the Panel are limited to approximately 5 minutes. Since oral statements will be permitted
only as time permits, the Agency urges the public to submit written comments in lieu of oral presentations. Persons
wishing to make oral and/or written statements should notify the Designated Federal Official and submit 20 copies
of a summary no later than November 4, 1994, to the Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations
Division (7506C), at the Virginia address given above, in order to ensure appropriate consideration by the Panel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Advisory Committee Report 



Single copies of the Recreation Access Advisory Committee's report may be obtained at no cost by calling the Access
Board's automated publications order line (202-272-5434), pressing 1 on the telephone keypad, then
1 again and requesting publication S26 (Recreation Report). Persons using a TTY should call 202-272-5449.
Please record a name, address and telephone number. Persons who want a copy in an alternate format, should specify
the type of format (audio cassette tape, braille, large print, or computer disk). 



Background 



The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is responsible for developing accessibility
guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to ensure that new construction and alterations of facilities
covered by the law are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
 The Access Board initially issued the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines in 1991. 36 CFR part
1191. ADAAG contains scoping provisions and technical specifications for designing parking areas, entrances,
toilet rooms and other elements and spaces that typically comprise a building and its site so that individuals with
disabilities will have ready access to and use of the facility. ADAAG also contains additional provisions for certain
types of facilities, including restaurants, medical care facilities, business and mercantile establishments,
libraries, transient lodging, and transportation facilities.
 






Various types of recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas are covered by the Americans with Disabilities
Act. Newly constructed and altered recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas are currently required to
comply with ADAAG, as adopted by the Department of Justice as the standards for accessible design (28 CFR 36.406),
where its provisions can be applied. For example, parking areas, entrances, toilet rooms, restaurants, and mercantile
establishments that are part of newly constructed and altered recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas
must comply with ADAAG.

3 







Recreation facilities and other outdoor developed areas have some unique features for which additional accessibility
guidelines need to be developed. In July 1993, the Access Board convened an advisory committee as the first step in
developing these guidelines. The committee was comprised of owners and operators of recreation facilities; persons
who design recreation facilities or manufacture related equipment; local, State and Federal officials responsible
for parks and other outdoor developed areas; and individuals with disabilities and organizations representing
their interests. 

The committee was requested to accomplish the following objectives within one year: 

 Develop a list of the various types of recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas; 

 Identify the features of each facility type that are not adequately addressed by ADAAG; 

 Consider any unique design issues or constraints affecting access to each facility type; 

 Review any existing voluntary guidelines for providing access to the various facility types; and 

 Make recommendations for accessibility guidelines for each facility type. 

The committee organized itself into six subcommittees based on facility types to accomplish these objectives: Sports
facilities; places of amusement; play settings; golf; boating and fishing facilities; and outdoor developed areas.


The committee met five times between July 1993 and May 1994. Committee members spent most of their time working in subcommittees
which reported to the full committee. The subcommittees also worked between committee meetings. Committee meetings
were well attended by persons interested in the committee's work and public comment was received at each meeting.
The subcommittees also encouraged interested persons to participate in their work, including providing information
and reviewing draft reports. More than 250 people actively participated in the committee's and subcommittees' work
and collectively gave between 50,000 and 60,000 hours of their time. 

In July 1994, the committee formally presented its report to the Access Board. During the next year, the Access Board
will review the committee's report and develop a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish accessibility guidelines
for newly constructed and altered recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas under the Americans with Disabilities
Act. The Access Board is also responsible for developing accessibility guidelines for federally financed facilities
under the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) and anticipates that the notice of proposed rulemaking
will also apply to recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas covered under that law. In view of the significant
public interest in the committee's report and the rulemaking, the Access Board is providing copies of the committee's
report to the public and will receive comments from the public on the committee's report for a 90-day period from the
publication of this notice. Comments received during this period will be considered along with the committee's report
as the Access Board develops the notice of proposed rulemaking. 

Local, State and Federal government agencies and private entities which own or operate recreation facilities and
outdoor developed areas are encouraged to review the committee's report and to send their comments to the Access Board.
Individuals with disabilities and their organizations, and other interested persons are also encouraged to review
and comment on the committee's report.

The committee's report contains recommendations only, and are not proposed or final accessibility guidelines.
As indicated above, the committee performed most of its work through six subcommittees based on facility types. The
recommendations represent the consensus of the members of each subcommittee, and not necessarily the full committee.
The subcommittees approached their work with the premise that every newly constructed and altered recreation facility
should be accessible. Separate facilities or areas for use by individuals with disabilities were considered to be
inconsistent with the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act. The subcommittees
identified numerous features of recreation facilities that are not adequately addressed by ADAAG. In some cases,
the subcommittees recommended amending existing ADAAG sections to address the specific features. In other cases,
the subcommittees recommended new scoping provisions and technical specifications for ADAAG and drafted guideline
language with rationale. The draft guideline language does not necessarily conform to the ADAAG format and numbering
system. Persons reviewing the committee's report need not comment on the format of the draft guideline language.
The Access Board will address format issues when it develops the notice of proposed rulemaking. Rather, persons reviewing
the committee's report should focus on the substance of the recommendations. 

The subcommittees also identified a few areas where providing access could eliminate or change the recreation activity
or experience and proposed possible solutions.

 For example, the sports facilities subcommittee identified that providing a slip resistant surface on ice skating
rinks would eliminate or change the sport and recommended that the ice surface of the rink should be exempt from any
slip resistance requirement. In some areas, the subcommittees recommended that additional information and research
were needed for providing access. Finally, the subcommittees noted several areas where accessibility guidelines
need to be coordinated with other laws and regulations, including regulations issued by the Department of Justice.
The Access Board will refer these issues to the appropriate agencies, including the Department of Justice, for their
consideration. 





The committee's report is 202 pages and contains many detailed recommendations which cannot be readily summarized
in this notice. To assist persons reviewing the committee's report, some of the recommendations are discussed below
with questions. The Access Board is interested in receiving comments on all parts of the committee's report and encourages
persons interested in the rulemaking to review the entire report. In addition, the Access Board requests comments
on the impact of the committee's report on the safety of all persons using the facilities and on potential costs of the
recommendations in the committee's report and how these costs could be minimized while accommodating safety.



Sports Facilities (Pages 1-62)

5 







Field-of-Play (Pages 5-6) 





The sports facilities subcommittee examined field sports, court sports, rink sports, and a variety of other sports.
Individuals with disabilities may participate in sports as spectators, players, coaches or assistants, or may be
employees of sports facilities and should have access to all elements and spaces of the facilities. The subcommittee
recommended that an accessible route be provided to the field-of-play. The subcommittee observed that in some sports,
the field-of-play consists of grass, artificial turf, sand, soil, ice, or other materials which do not fully meet
the ADAAG requirement that surfaces along accessible routes and in accessible spaces must be stable, firm and slip
resistant. The subcommittee recommended that where requiring the playing field surface to be stable, firm and slip
resistant would eliminate or substantially change the sport, an exception to this requirement should be provided
for the field-of-play. 

In some sports, the field-of-play may extend to the sideline area directly adjacent to the boundary of the playing
field. For example, in baseball a player can chase a foul ball beyond the ``within-bounds'' area. The sports facilities
subcommittee suggested that designated key accessible route locations could be safely incorporated into sideline
or ``out-of-bounds'' areas; or temporary, removable surfaces could be used to provide access to these areas. 



Question 1: 

What are other possible solutions for providing an accessible route to sideline or ``out-of-bounds'' areas used
by coaches, press and others where the field-of-play may extend to or overlap these areas? Persons responding to this
question are requested to provide information regarding the location, surface requirements, and width of an accessible
route serving these areas. 



Pools (Pages 16-20)

The sports facilities subcommittee also examined access to pools.
 There are many different types of pools such as competition pools, lap pools, leisure or family pools, and wading or
children's pools. Pools are found in a variety of settings from hotels and other places of transient lodging to public
parks and community centers. The sports facilities subcommittee identified three means for providing access into
the water: ramps, lifts, and transfer tiers. As discussed at pages 16-18 of the committee's report, each of these
means accommodates varying capabilities of individuals with disabilities with no single means best for all users.
For example, ramps can facilitate independence. However, ramps require transfer to an additional chair and raise
concerns regarding buoyance and water resistance for individuals ascending and descending the ramp. Lift operation
may require individuals with disabilities to seek assistance; and transfer tiers pose a higher level of physical
challenge. 





The sports facilities subcommittee recommended that one accessible means of entry into the water should be required
and that a range of alternatives (ramps, lifts, or transfer tiers) should be allowed. The subcommittee further recommended
that where pools exceed a certain size, two accessible means of entry into the water should be required. (The subcommittee
did not recommend a specific size.) The subcommittee emphasized that any means of entry into the water should allow
for individuals with disabilities to use pools independently and with dignity. 



Question 2: 

Given the different types of pools and various means that individuals with disabilities use for entering the water,
should a range of alternatives (ramps, lifts, or transfer tiers) be allowed for providing access into the water? If
not, should specific means be required and others not permitted for certain types of pools? Should requirements be
related to the size of the pools, with larger pools required to provide more than one means of entry into the water? If
so, what size or other criteria should trigger the additional requirement? If specific means for entering the water
are required, should technical specifications be developed for those means? 



Places of Amusement (Pages 63-88) 



Amusement Rides (Pages 74-85) 



The places of amusement subcommittee examined access to amusement rides. As defined by the subcommittee, amusement
ride systems consist of amusement devices which carry or move a person or persons on, around, over or through a fixed
or restricted course or within a defined area for purpose of amusement or entertainment and includes related elements,
facilities and systems. For new construction, the subcommittee recommended that, to the greatest extent possible,
at least one wheelchair space be provided within the amusement ride system where the amusement device can accommodate
a person seated in a wheelchair without changing the nature of the amusement ride system or experience. When an amusement
device cannot accommodate a person seated in a wheelchair, the subcommittee recommended that, to the greatest extent
possible, a means of transfer onto the amusement device be provided without changing the nature of the amusement ride
system or device. The subcommittee drafted detailed recommended guidelines for accomplishing a transfer from a
wheelchair to the amusement device. 

The places of amusement subcommittee recommended that decisions regarding the type of access provided (roll-on
or transfer) be made by designers on a ride-by-ride basis after considering a variety of factors, including seating
space and configuration, ride speed, forces and accelerations during normal and emergency operation, riding posture
and center of gravity, restraining systems, and safety of others. 



Question 3: 

Should a percentage of rides in newly constructed places of amusement provide either roll-on or transfer access for
individuals who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids? It is acceptable to permit some rides not to provide roll-on
or transfer access and, if so, what should be the criteria for not providing access? In new construction, is it acceptable
that the type of access provided (roll-on or transfer) be determined on a ride-by-ride basis? The Access Board is interested
in any studies or other data that provide information on the dynamic effects of forces experienced on certain rides
on individuals with disabilities. 



Carnivals and Fairs (Pages 73-74) 



The places of amusement subcommittee also examined access to amusement rides used in temporary places of amusement
such as carnivals and fairs. These amusement rides are transported on trucks and trailers, and are set up and leveled
at different sites for temporary events. Depending on the terrain, the distance from the ground to ride may vary from
four to six feet. The subcommittee recommended that these amusement rides comply with the same requirements as amusement
rides at permanent sites. 



Question 4: 

Should amusement rides used in temporary places of amusement be addressed in the same manner as rides at permanent
sites? The Access Board is interested in receiving information on ways to provide access to these amusement rides.


Carnivals and fairs may be held on partially improved or unimproved sites such as city parks, athletic fields, or agricultural
fields that are not specifically designed for the event and that do not provide stable, firm and slip resistant surfaces
required for an accessible route. The places of amusement subcommittee recommended that where, due to the temporary
nature of the event, changes to topography or surface conditions would be inconsistent with the primary purpose of
the site, temporary, removable surfaces be used to provide an accessible path to rides and other attractions. 



Question 5: 

Should temporary places of amusement be required to meet all the provisions for an accessible route when held on partially
improved or unimproved sites? If not, what provisions should be modified (e.g., stable, firm and slip resistant surface;
slope; cross slope; width; accessible elements connected)? How should protruding objects such as tent stakes and
lines be addressed? 



Play Settings (Pages 89-102) 



Accessible Route (Pages 91-93) 



The play settings subcommittee examined issues related to providing access to play areas and equipment. Play settings
vary greatly in size and may be found in schools, day care centers, fast food restaurants, amusement parks, and public
parks. Play is an important social experience that occurs in many ways within a play area. Play settings often include
play equipment such as slides, swings, ladders, sand play areas, and open areas for play. Children without disabilities
have the opportunity to maneuver throughout play areas and to access their choice of play equipment. Designers have
a unique challenge in providing children with disabilities the same access. 

Designers usually provide resilient surfaces meeting the ASTM F1292 performance standard within the use zone of
play equipment as a safety measure. (This is also called ``the fall zone.'') Some resilient surfaces such as sand and
wood chips are not stable, firm and slip resistant and, thus, would not meet the requirements for an accessible route.
The play settings subcommittee considered cost and maintenance issues related to various types of surfaces and recommended
that an expanded accessible route which is a minimum of 60 inches wide connect accessible activities within the play
area in order to promote social interaction and use of the play components. This accessible route would be stable,
firm, slip resistant, safe to crawl on, and where within the use zone of equipment, resilient. 



Question 6: 

Does the play subcommittee's recommendation for an expanded accessible route adequately address the need for access
within play settings? Persons responding to this question should review pages 91-93 of the committee's report.




Elevated Play Equipment (Pages 93-96) 



The play setting subcommittee identified ramps and transfer systems (transfer platforms, decked platforms, and
berms or natural hills) as means for providing access to elevated play equipment. For larger composite play structures
having 12 or more elevated play components (or 12 or more elevated play components at one site serving the same age group),
the subcommittee recommended that both ramps and transfer systems should be required, and that each means access
at least one-half of the elevated play components on the play structure. The subcommittee further recommended that
one-half of the play components which are accessed by ramps should be required to be like or similar to those elevated
play components that are not accessed by ramps. For smaller composite play structures having less than 12 elevated
play components, the subcommittee recommended that transfer systems should be required to access at least one-half
of the elevated play components, and that one-half of those play components be like or similar to the elevated play
components that are not accessible. 



Question 7: 

Should a requirement for ramp access, in addition to transfer systems, be based on the number of play components? If
so, what number of play components should trigger a ramp requirement, in addition to transfer systems? 



Soft Contained Play Systems (Page 99) 



Soft contained play systems are relatively new and are comprised of fully enclosed, resilient play components that
are designed so that children climb through and within the structure. Most incorporate play activities on several
different levels. Some cover 3,000 square feet and are over 20 feet high. These play structures are found in amusement
parks, connected with fast food restaurants, or as stand-alone facilities. The play settings subcommittee recommended
that these play structures be accessible and provide integration, and noted that the ASTM F1536 committee is currently
developing standards for them.

Question 8:

 Should soft contained play systems be subject to the same requirements as other play structures? The Access Board
is interested in receiving information on how access can be provided to these play structures.
