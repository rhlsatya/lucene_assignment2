Potassium Permanganate From the People's Republic of China; Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 15, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a request from Carus Chemical Company (Carus),
the petitioner, that it be permitted to withdraw its request for an administrative review, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5)
(1994), of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the
period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. Although the Department received the request to withdraw after
the normal period allowed, the Department is terminating this administrative review in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), the Department may extend the normal 90-day time limit for withdrawal of a
request for review if the Department determines it is reasonable to do so. We have determined that it is reasonable
to extend the time limit for Carus' request because we have not yet issued questionnaires for this period and because
there is no indication on the record that the substantive rights of any party would be impaired by such a decision.



Respondent Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi) and an importer, Novachem, Inc. (Novachem), have objected to the termination
request on the grounds that (1) Zunyi intended to submit adequate information in the current review in order to avoid
the application of best information available as was done in the 1990 review, the final results of which were published
on May 23, 1994 (59 FR 26625), and (2) petitioner's request for termination of this review was untimely.

Regardless of its stated intent to supply adequate information in the current review, Zunyi should have been aware
that because the 1993 review was based solely on the petitioner's request, that request could be withdrawn pursuant
to 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). 

Because we have extended the 90-day time period for requesting withdrawal, we hereby grant Carus' request for withdrawal.

This notice is published in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675) and 19
CFR 353.22(a)(5).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of class deviation from 10 CFR 600.14(f).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, 

Deviations, 

the Department of Energy has authorized a class deviation from 10 CFR 14(f) which requires a 

Federal Register

 Notice of each financial assistance award. This deviation applies exclusively to applications received in response
to a Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) entitled Invitation for Proposals Designed to Support Federal Agencies and
Commercial Interests in Meeting Special Power and Propulsion Needs for Future Space Missions (58 FR 63931, December
3, 1993) which was published by the Department of Energy. Applications submitted in response to the NOPI were accepted
through January 31, 1994.


The intent of publishing notification of financial assistance awards is to foster competition and provide information
regarding subcontracting opportunities. However, a Notice of Program Opportunity has already served as notice
to interested applicants, and no subcontracting opportunities have been identified. Additionally, due to programmatic
requirements, it is important that awards be made as soon as possible. Therefore, the Department of Energy has determined,
pursuant to 10 CFR 600.4, that a deviation from the requirement to publish a 

Federal Register

 Notice of each such award is (1) Necessary to achieve program objectives, (2) necessary to conserve public funds.

In the Matter of: The Trane Company (Case No. F-074) 


Background 


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B. 
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

Trane filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated June 9, 1994, in accordance with  430.27 of 10 CFR part 430. The Department
published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 29, 1994, Trane's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 38591.
Trane also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under  430.27(g) which DOE granted on July 25, 1994.
59 FR 38591, July 29, 1994. 
No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Rheem Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Trane. 


Assertions and Determinations 


Trane's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Trane requests the allowance to test using a 45-second
blower time delay when testing its YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible package units. Trane states that since the 45-second
delay is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an average of 0.3 percent
improvement in energy efficiency, the petition should be granted. 
Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. Trane indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible package units. 
Since the blower controls incorporated on the Trane furnaces are designed to impose a 45-second blower delay in every
instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees
that a waiver should be granted to allow the 45-second blower time delay when testing the Trane YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible
package units. Accordingly, with regard to testing the YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible package units, today's Decision
and Order exempts Trane from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 45-second
delay. 
It is, therefore, ordered that: 
(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by The Trane Company (Case No. F-074) is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph
(2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 
(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, The Trane Company, shall be
permitted to test its YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible package units on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10
CFR part 430, with modifications set forth below: 
(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:
3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows:
 
3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t^), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 
(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, The Trane Company shall comply in all respects with
the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. 
(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the YCC, YCX, and DCX convertible package units manufactured by The Trane Company. 
(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 
(5) Effective September 7, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted The Trane Company on July 25, 1994.
59 FR 38591, July 29, 1994 (Case No. F-074).

 

Issued In Washington, DC, on September 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Grand River Dam Authority; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


September 15, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the
application for non-project use of project lands for the Pensacola Hydroelectric Project. The application proposes
dredging 740 cubic yards of material from a site located at the Monkey Island area of Grand Lake O' The Cherokees, in
Delaware County, Oklahoma. The staff prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the action. In the EA, staff concludes
that approval of the non-project use of project lands would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment.

<DOCTITLE>Massachusetts: Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Tentative Determination to Fully Approve the Adequacy of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's Municipal
Solid Waste Permitting Program, Extension of Public Comment Period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(B), requires states to develop and implement permit programs
to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity
generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C),
42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate
``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and
is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA
will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate
State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final
promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory
authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide
for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only
those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibilities
provided by 40 CFR Part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless
of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria shall
apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 


The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA,
42 USC  6945(c)(1)(C). EPA Region I has reviewed Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program adequacy application
and has made a tentative determination that all portions of Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program are adequate to
assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. The public comment period is being extended for 30 days in order
to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to comment on the Massachusetts MSWLF permitting program.
Massachusetts's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment at the
places listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section below during regular office hours.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in Section 4005(c)(1)(C),
42 USC  6945(c)(1)(C) that EPA determine the adequacy of state municipal solid waste landfill permit programs
to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted
and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements
which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets
the requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits, or other forms of prior approval
and conditions (for example, license to operate) to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe
must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF
criteria. Second, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval and conditions
to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in
permit issuance and enforcement as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 USC  6974(b). Finally, the State/Tribe
must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against
any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 
EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects
States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to
a MSWLF program.

On August 13, 1993, EPA Region I received Massachusetts's final MSWLF Permit Program application for adequacy determination.
Region I reviewed the final application and submitted comments to Massachusetts. Massachusetts addressed EPA's
comments and submitted a revised final application for adequacy determination on August 30, 1993. Region I received
additional clarifying information on the Massachusetts MSWLF Permit Program on November 2, 1993 and March 23, 1994.
Region I has reviewed Massachusetts's revised application and has tentatively determined that all portions of Massachusetts's
MSWLF program meet all the requirements necessary to qualify for full program approval and ensures compliance with
the revised Federal Criteria. 
The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until October 21, 1994. Copies of Massachusetts's
application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 
In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the jurisdiction for siting and permitting of solid waste management facilities
lies with local boards of health and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), an agency falling under the
Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA). The Department of Public Health (DPH) is also given an advisory
role in the siting process. Authority for respective roles of the boards of health, DEP and DPH is granted by Chapter
111, section 150A of the Massachusetts General Laws. Region I based its decision of tentative full approval on the
current approach for approving the construction and operation of MSWLFs in Massachusetts. This approach includes:

(1) a review pursuant to the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), a public information process that generally
involves the submission of an Environmental Impact Report, which must be approved by the Secretary of the Office of
Environmental Affairs; (2) a Site Assignment Process, which focuses on determining whether a specific location
is suitable for a specific type of solid waste facility (the local board of health is responsible for granting a site
assignment in accordance with the procedures and criteria at 310 CMR 16.00); and (3) a Solid Waste Management Facility
Permit, a permit that must be obtained from DEP's Division of Solid Waste Management after completing the MEPA process
and obtaining a site assignment. The permitting process regulates the design, operation and maintenance, closure,
post-closure and financial assurance aspects of a facility. 
The Massachusetts regulations require, at 310 CMR 19.021, the repermitting of all landfills existing as of the effective
date of July 1, 1990, unless they choose to close prior to July 1, 1992. Furthermore, the regulations at 310 CMR 19.022(1)
require the completion of closure of all unlined areas of landfills by July 1, 1995. A recent amendment of MGL c. 111,
s. 150A makes the 1995 closure date applicable only to privately owned landfills. 
The design standard for new and lateral expansions of landfills currently in effect in Massachusetts includes a composite
liner system which features: a subgrade layer which must ensure a minimum of four foot separation between the top of
bedrock or the maximum high groundwater table and the bottom of the lowermost low permeability layer; a two foot, low
permeability, soil/admixture layer having a maximum in-place saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1x10-7
cm/sec; a minimum 30-mil flexible membrane liner (60-mil minimum for high density polyethylene) in direct contact
with the underlying soil/admixture; a drainage/protection layer; and a leachate collection system. Alternative
liner designs must meet the performance standard for ground water protection systems found at 310 CMR 19.110 and do
so in a manner which meets or exceeds the design standard of that section. 
The current siting criteria carefully restrict new or expanding landfills from being located in settings that may
conflict with the Location Criteria specified in 40 CFR Sections 258.10, 258.11, 258.12, 258.13, 258.14 and 258.16.
By currently restricting landfills to such settings, Massachusetts has protected all state drinking water resources,
whether surface water or groundwater, from the potential impact of leachate -an approach which EPA has determined
to be an alternate to the 40 CFR Part 258 requirements, but still as protective as the federal requirements at 40 CFR
Part 258. In addition, the Commonwealth's requirements are no less stringent than the requirements set forth at 40
CFR Part 258. 
The Massachusetts MSWLF Permitting Program features an unique approach to landfill assessment which includes four
parts. The first part is an Initial Site Assessment (ISA), which examines the general history of the site, the types
and amounts of waste landfilled, the size of the site and other historical information concerning the site. The second
part is a Comprehensive Site Assessment (CSA) to characterize the nature and extent of any contamination that may
exist. The CSA, which is used to develop a suitable closure strategy, involves, in its final step, a two-phased risk
assessment approach to determine whether corrective action is warranted. The first phase of the risk assessment
is called a qualitative risk assessment. The following three pieces of information are analyzed in this phase: the
existence of contamination above standards or approved levels; the existence of potential public health or environmental
receptors; and the existence of pathways which would serve to link contamination to receptors. If all three are determined
to exist in any media (air, surface water, ground water or soil), the second phase in the risk assessment process, the
quantitative risk assessment, is invoked as is a round of sampling for all the 40 CFR Part 258, Appendix II constituents.
The third part of the landfill assessment is a Corrective Actions Alternatives Analysis (CAAA), which is conducted
to determine the type of cap and any additional remediation measures which will be needed to properly close the sanitary
landfill. The fourth and final part of the landfill assessment process is a Corrective Action Design (CAD), in which
the landfill cap and any additional remediation measures are designed. 
Massachusetts covers the landfill assessment requirements in more detail in its 

Guidance on Conducting Qualitative Risk Assessments at Solid Waste Landfills

 and 

Guidance for Disposal Site Risk Characterization and Related Phase II Activities.

 The revised 

Landfill Assessment and Closure Guidance Manual

 (LAC Manual) is applicable to all existing MSWLFs and to all MSWLF permit applications effective July 1, 1993. Massachusetts
will implement its MSWLF permit program through enforceable permit conditions. To ensure compliance with the federal
criteria, Massachusetts has revised its current permit requirements through the existing 

Supplement to Landfill Assessment and Closure Manual.

 These revisions occur in the following areas: 
1. The adoption of the EPA approved method 8260 to test ground water. 
2. Addition of the provision on the minimum distance of a ground water monitoring well from the landfill boundary.

3. Compliance with the protocols for testing and analyzing ground water for constituents listed in Appendix II to
Part 258. 
4. Compliance with the procedures for notifying the DEP about explosive levels of landfill gas. 
5. Compliance with the protocols for conducting inspections to detect presence of hazardous waste and procedures
for reporting results of such inspections. 
6. Compliance with the minimum design standard for alternative landfill cover. 
The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection will update the permits of existing municipal solid waste
landfills scheduled to remain open after the effective date of 40 CFR Part 258, to assure compliance with current state
requirements. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not asserting jurisdiction over Tribal land recognized by the
United States government for the purpose of this notice. Tribes recognized by the United States government are also
required to comply with the terms and conditions found at 40 CFR Part 258. 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is committed to implementing its MSWLF program in accordance with the principles
of environmental equity. The Commonwealth has expressed this commitment in an addendum to the narrative portion
of its application. 
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Massachusetts's program. EPA
will make a final decision on approval of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's program and will give notice of the final
determination in the 

Federal Register

. The notice shall include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all significant comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA, 42 USC  6945(a) provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section
7002 of RCRA, 42 USC  6972 to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria set forth in 40 CFR Part 258 independent of any
State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that
any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to
be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 USC  605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice,
therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 



Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of Sections 2002, 4005 and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended,
42 USC   6912, 6945 and 6949a(c-c).

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; Intent to Cancel Registrations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces the Agency's intent to cancel the registrations of the pesticide products Vaporooter A Foaming
Fumigant (EPA Reg. No. 9993-1), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No. 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No.
9993-3). EPA has determined that continued sale, distribution, and use of the products would cause unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. EPA bases this determination on data and other information showing that products
that contain metam-sodium (sodium methyldithiocarbamate) when used for control of root growth in sewer lines must
be classified for ``Restricted Use Only'' to ensure their safe use. The chemical is hazardous, and applicators need
to wear protective equipment and receive specialized training when using the products for this use. Airrigation
Engineering Co., Inc. (Airrigation) has failed to comply with the Agency's requirement for Restricted Use classification
for the products listed above. EPA is therefore issuing this Notice of Intent to Cancel as required by section 6(b)
of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Introduction


This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registrations of the pesticide products Vaporooter A Foaming Fumigant
(EPA Reg. No. 9993-1), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No. 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No. 9993-3).
For the reasons set forth below, the Administrator has determined that these products, when used in accordance with
widespread and commonly recognized practice, will generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on public health
and/or the environment unless they are classified for restricted use. This determination is based on the hazardous
nature of these products and their active ingredient, metam-sodium; the complex application method for use of these
products; the need for specialized equipment and training to apply these products; and the potential for residential
exposure to the products due to incorrect application procedures.


A. Organization of this Notice


This Notice is divided into nine units. Unit I provides introductory information and describes the legal authority
for this action. Unit II discusses the factual background for this action, including information relating to the
active ingredient metamsodium, and communications with Airrigation Engineering Co. Unit III presents the EPA's
determinations with regard to Airrigation's sewer use products. Unit IV describes the role of the Scientific Advisory
Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture relating to this action. Unit V sets forth the Agency's determination that
these product registrations must be canceled. Unit VI discusses the disposition of existing stocks of the products.
Unit VII contains a discussion of the procedures for implementing the actions required by this Notice, as well as the
procedures for requesting a hearing. Unit VIII identifies the references. Unit IX gives information on the Public
Docket. 


B. Legal Authority


Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product
must be registered by EPA, pursuant to FIFRA sections 3(a) and 12(a)(1).
A registration is a license allowing a pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance
with specific use instructions, precautions and other terms and conditions. A pesticide product may be registered
or remain registered only if it meets the statutory standard for registration. Among other things, a pesticide must
perform its intended pesticidal function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''
(FIFRA section 3(c)(5)). ``Unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined as ``any unreasonable
risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of
the use of [the] pesticide'' (FIFRA section 2(bb)).
In addition, under FIFRA section 3(d)(1)(C), the Administrator may classify a pesticide for restricted use if she
determines that the pesticide, when applied in accordance with its directions for use, warnings, and cautions, or,
in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, may generally cause unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment, without additional regulatory restrictions. Once classified for restricted use, a product
can be applied only by or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator (FIFRA sections 3(d)(1)(C), 12(a)(2)(F),
12(a)(2)(G)). EPA has promulgated regulations which establish the procedures EPA will follow when classifying
a product for restricted use. Pursuant to 40 CFR 152.165(c)(2), the Agency may notify a registrant of the decision
to classify its product for restricted use and require the registrant to submit certain information, listed in paragraph
(c)(1) of that section, to comply with the classification decision. If the registrant fails to comply with this notification,
the Agency may initiate cancellation proceedings.

The regulations at 40 CFR 152.170(a) provide general criteria that guide EPA's decision to classify a pesticide product
for restricted use. In general, use of a product will be restricted if the Agency determines that: (1) the product or
its use poses a serious hazard that may be mitigated by restricting use; (2) the product's labeling, when considered
according to the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of that section, is not adequate to mitigate the hazard(s); (3) restriction
of the product would decrease the risk of adverse effects; and (4) the decrease in risks of the pesticide as a result
of restriction would exceed any attendant decrease in benefits. Paragraph (e)(2) of that section states that labeling
will be judged adequate, and therefore will be appropriate for unrestricted use products, if it meets all of the following
criteria: (1) the user would not be required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring specialized training
and/or experience; (2) the label directions do not call for a specialized apparatus, protective equipment, or materials
that reasonably would not be available to the general public; (3) failure to follow label directions in a minor way
would result in few or no significant adverse effects; (4) following directions for use would result in few or no significant
adverse effects of a delayed or indirect nature through bioaccumulation, persistence, or pesticide movement from
the original application site; and (5) widespread and commonly recognized practices of use would not nullify or detract
from label directions such that unreasonable adverse effects on the environment might occur.
The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all
times on the proponents of initial or continued registration. Under FIFRA section 6, the Agency may issue a Notice
of Intent to Cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever it appears to the Administrator that the product
no longer satisfies the statutory criteria for registration. If appropriate, the Agency may require modifications
to the terms and conditions of registration, such as deletion of particular uses or revisions in labeling, as an alternative
to cancellation. If the Notice requires such changes, cancellation may be avoided by making the changes specified
in the Notice, if possible. Adversely affected persons may also request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified
registration. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration will be continued pending a decision at
the conclusion of an administrative hearing. 


II. Factual Background


A. Metam-Sodium


Metam-sodium, the sodium salt of methyldithiocarbamate, is extremely volatile and very unstable under aerobic
conditions with a half-life of 23 minutes. Its principal derivative is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC). In water, metam-sodium
is rapidly decomposed to MITC and hydrogen sulfide (H

2

S). Pesticide products containing metam-sodium are registered for numerous agricultural and non-agricultural
uses, including as a soil fumigant to control insects, nematodes, soil-borne diseases, and weeds prior to planting
crops. Other uses include wood preservation, tree root killer in sewers, slimicide, and use in sugar refineries.
Metam-sodium and MITC show varying degrees of acute and chronic toxicity. Due to the chemical nature of metam-sodium,
in that it is readily hydrolyzed to MITC and H

2

S, the Agency believes that exposure from pesticide use would be related to MITC rather than metam-sodium (Ref. 1).
MITC is shown to be moderately toxic in short-term (acute) exposures to laboratory test animals. In rabbits, MITC
is shown to be a severe skin and respiratory tract irritant and a severe eye irritant. Test animals exposed to high levels
of air-borne MITC in acute studies show eye irritation, hypoactivity, distressed breathing, convulsions, and death.
Metam-sodium is shown to be slightly toxic to laboratory test animals in acute studies. If on skin or ingested, it is
corrosive and causes severe irritation or burns. Metam-sodium has the potential for causing adverse health effects
from both acute and chronic exposures. In addition, existing medical conditions may be exacerbated upon exposure
to metam-sodium. Acute health effects include excessive salivation, sweating, fatigue, weakness, nausea, headache,
dizziness, and eye and respiratory tract irritation. Chronic conditions can include conjunctivitis, photophobia,
and blurred vision. Studies also have suggested that the chemical may exhibit reproductive toxicity. Medical conditions
that are prone to further aggravation upon exposure to metam-sodium include impaired pulmonary functions and preexisting
eye problems.

Potential public health and environmental impacts of this chemical were demonstrated when in July 1991, a train derailment
resulted in 19,500 gallons of metam-sodium being spilled into the Sacramento River near Dunsmuir, California. All
aquatic life and substantial shoreline vegetation along a 45-mile stretch of river leading to Lake Shasta were killed.
As a result of this incident, the Agency expanded and intensified ongoing review of this chemical. Registrants formed
the Metam-Sodium Task Force in response to the Agency's request for data needed to fully assess the environmental
and public health impact of this chemical.

The Agency's review of available data led to conclusions that agricultural uses of metam-sodium may result in unacceptable
risk from acute and developmental toxicity effects. In order to mitigate agricultural use risks, EPA and the Task
Force entered into an agreement which included: (1) label amendments to limit around-home and small-area uses (lawns,
seed-beds, plant-beds, and other non-field limited areas) to certified applicators; products will be labeled with
``Restricted Use''; (2) label amendments to include requirements for protective clothing and equipment; (3) a reentry
waiting period of 48 hours for agricultural sites; and (4) a tarping requirement for treated areas adjacent to homes.
These requirements are currently in place and were voluntarily implemented with the cooperation of the Task Force
consisting of all producers of technical grade metam-sodium as well as other product formulators.

In addition to this agreement between EPA and the registrants, both parties initiated reviews of other uses of metam-sodium.
These reviews were intended to determine what measures, if any, would be needed to further mitigate risk.



B. Use of Metam-Sodium in Sewers


Sewer lines are frequently damaged and blocked by tree roots. This is a perennial and costly problem for municipalities.
Lateral lines to buildings on private property may also be damaged and blocked by roots. A mechanical remedy involves
the use of a rotary cutting tool. This technique only offers temporary results, and may even exacerbate the problem
by causing root branching. Rotary cutters also damage sewer pipes. When the damage and blockage are too severe, sewers
are dug up and replaced at considerable cost to the community or property owner (Ref. 2).

Sewer root control via this chemical system involves the use of metam-sodium, dichlobenil, and a foaming agent. Application
of this pesticide involves premixing of measured chemicals and a knowledge of calibrated chemical feeding, pressurizing,
and foam-generating equipment.

In 1971 and 1973, Airrigation obtained registrations for two pesticide products to control roots in sewers. Each
product consisted of metam-sodium and dichlobenil mixed together just prior to use. A patent was obtained which prevented
potential competition from marketing this type of combination product for controlling roots in sewers. The registrant
limited sales of its products to a few contractors and encouraged them to train their staff due to the complex application
method. Experience with this pesticide treatment over the ensuing years showed it to be superior to mechanical methods
and it became the preferred method for controlling roots in sewers. Following the expiration of Airrigation's patent,
three additional products have been registered for this use.

In March 1993, EPA learned of an incident that occurred approximately 1 year prior to that involving Airrigation's
product, Sanafoam Vaporooter II. In that incident, a worker in Los Alamos, New Mexico, improperly applied the Sanafoam
product, causing the product to back up into the plumbing of a nearby residence. The residents reported the incident
to EPA, stating that they suffered respiratory and pulmonary injury (Ref. 3). Airrigation did not provide EPA with
any information regarding the incident.

More recently, on July 11, 1994, an incident involving a metam-sodium sewer use product occurred in Roseville, CA,
and resulted in a home being evacuated (Ref. 4). The foam product being applied by a municipal sewer maintenance crew
flowed into one home and out into the yard of another home located behind it. What caused the pesticide product to flow
into the home rather than down the sewer pipes is being investigated.

Upon completing review of the available data base and use history of products in this application, the Agency concluded
that the sewer root control use of metam-sodium should be restricted. This decision was based largely upon the potential
risks to workers and the public due to the hazardous nature of the chemical, the need for specialized training associated
with complex equipment and application procedures, the need for specialized protective equipment, the potential
for metam-sodium to enter buildings through drains, and the potential for damage to sewage biological digestion
processes (Ref. 8). Technical information supporting this restricted-use classification was obtained from product
literature on the registered products, two applicants of pending metam-sodium sewer use products with experience
as contract users of similar registered products, and operation records from two large municipal sewage treatment
systems. Moreover, the Agency believes that because of the patent expiration and the effectiveness of metam-sodium
root control, there is the probability of large market expansion throughout the United States with increased potential
risk from new suppliers. The Agency has concluded that the complex application method could pose an unreasonable
risk to inadequately trained workers as well as to the public.

The Agency has also concluded that restricted use classification should be phased in over time to allow for development
of a training program for applicator certification. This program is being designed by metam-sodium registrants,
in cooperation with the Agency. The restricted use requirement will only go into effect after the training manual,
testing, and certification are available. The three most recent registrants have agreed to restricted use classification
and to support development of EPA/State training programs for applicator certification. The restricted use classification
must be reflected on product labeling within 120 days of the issuance of an EPA accepted training manual for applicator
certification.

Airrigation's sewer treatment products are not currently classified as restricted use pesticides. Therefore,
any persons can purchase and apply these products, regardless of their qualifications to do so. Airrigation has asserted
that restricting the use of these products is not necessary because Airrigation gives a training program to all customers
who purchase the products. However, EPA believes that this system is insufficient to assure that the people who actually
perform the product application are adequately trained. If these products were classified for restricted use, it
would be a violation of FIFRA for anyone other than a certified applicator, or someone under the direct supervision
of a certified applicator, to apply the products (FIFRA sections 12(a)(2)(F),(G)), and EPA would have assurance
that the applicators had at least received the requisite training in use of these products.

Pursuant to the decision by EPA to classify all metam-sodium sewer use products as restricted use pesticides, the
Agency communicated frequently with affected registrants on this matter. The Agency's initial approach to implementing
restricted use classification was to request voluntary compliance in the spirit of continued cooperation between
EPA and the industry. Except for Airrigation, all affected registrants of both pending and registered metam-sodium
sewer use products agreed to comply. Despite numerous meetings and much correspondence with EPA, Airrigation has
remained steadfast in its refusal to voluntarily implement EPA's determination. Therefore, on September 24, 1993,
a letter was sent to Airrigation which formally requested, pursuant to 40 CFR 152.165(c)(2), that the company submit
amended labeling for the above-named products to reflect a restricted use classification and additionally requested
a written response to that letter within 10 days (Ref. 5). Airrigation responded in a letter dated October 14, 1993,
that was received by the Agency on October 22, 1993. The letter stated that the company declined to agree to the reclassification
of its products (Ref. 6). Because Airrigation has failed to adopt the Agency's classification of its products for
restricted use, EPA is initiating this cancellation action. 


III. Findings on Airrigation Engineering Sewer Use Products 


A. General Criteria


The Agency has determined, pursuant to FIFRA section 3(d)(1)(C), that restricted use classification for the use
of metam-sodium in sewers is required due to the elaborate and complicated methods of applying this chemical and the
potential for harmful human exposure. The Agency has examined available information regarding risks from potential
exposure to metam-sodium use in sewer root control and has concluded that existing and potential risks are unacceptable,
based upon the following:
1. These products pose a serious hazard to workers and the public due to their acute toxicity and developmental toxicity,
which are evident from available toxicological studies (Ref. 1). There is a potential, realized in at least one incident,
for the products to invade residential and commercial properties during use, causing injury to those inside (Ref.
2). Inhalation and dermal exposure risks to mixer/loaders and applicators exist due to the high volatility of methyl
isothiocyanate (MITC), the principle derivative of metam-sodium (Ref. 1). Potential for worker and public exposure,
through misuse or otherwise, is significant due to the complexity of the application method used for applying metam-sodium
in sewer systems (Ref. 7). In addition, these products have the potential to contaminate ground and surface water,
and to damage biological sewage treatment systems (Ref. 8). The Agency believes that these hazards could be mitigated
through restricting the products' use.
2. The current labeling of the Airrigation products is not adequate to mitigate the hazard these products pose. Under
EPA's regulations, a label will be deemed ``adequate,'' and thus suitable for products classified for general use,
only if it meets all of the factors listed in 40 CFR 152.170(e)(2). Those factors are listed in Unit I.B. of this preamble.
EPA finds that Airrigation's sewer use products do not meet three of those factors as follows:
a. Users of these products are required to perform complex operations or procedures requiring specialized training
or experience. All of the products' labels state ``RECOMMENDED FOR USE BY TRAINED PERSONNEL'' (Refs. 9, 10, and 11).
On August 25, 1993, Agency personnel attended a demonstration of treatment of a sewer line with another metam sodium
product to learn first-hand the type of operations that are involved. The procedures and equipment utilized were
highly complex and clearly required specialized training and knowledge to effectively operate (Ref. 7). As noted
above, the current labeling of these products does not restrict who can apply the products. Although Airrigation
states that it provides some type of training to all of its customers, the Agency cannot ensure that only people who
have been adequately trained will be permitted to apply these products. Therefore, these products do not meet factor
(e)(2)(i).

b. The label directions for these products call for specialized apparatus and protective equipment that reasonably
would not be available to the general public. In order to use the products, the applicator must use a special foam generator
to convert the liquid product constituents to a foam form (Refs. 9, 10, and 11). The Foam-Coat Vaporooter label directs
users ``USE ONLY SPECIALIZED FOAM APPLICATION EQUIPMENT,'' and then states that this equipment is available from
Airrigation Engineering (Ref. 10). This machinery is necessary to produce the foam and to introduce the foam into
the sewer lines. The Sanafoam Vaporooter II label only gives directions for use of the product with Airrigation's
FOAM MAKER (R) generator (Ref. 11). In addition, that label's directions for use instruct the user to ``[u]se specialized
foam application equipment,'' and, if treating a building lateral line, to ``[b]e sure foam application discharge
hose is also of a specialized type'' (Ref. 11). Therefore, the Airrigation products' labels do not meet factor (e)(2)(ii).

c. Failure to follow label directions in a minor way could result in significant adverse effects. EPA is very concerned
regarding the potential these products have to invade residential or other structures through improper application.
The Sanafoam Vaporooter II label acknowledges this danger and states that ``caution must be used to assure foam does
not travel into adjacent structures'' (Ref. 11). However, as the incident in Los Alamos, NM, shows, this result is
possible in spite of the cautionary labeling. EPA no longer believes that this cautionary statement is sufficient
to mitigate these products' potential to expose the general public to highly toxic fumigants. A person who is not thoroughly
trained and familiar with the complicated application methods and equipment for these products could easily make
a minor error in the application procedure, which could cause widespread human exposure and result in adverse effects
to those people and the environment. Therefore, the Airrigation products' labels do not meet factor (e)(2)(iii).

3. Restriction of the use of metam-sodium products in sewers would decrease the risk of adverse effects to the public
and to workers. Requiring that all workers who apply these products be properly trained certified applicators, or
under the direct supervision of properly trained certified applicators, will ensure to the greatest degree possible
that users of these products have the requisite skill and ability to utilize the complex machinery and application
methods necessary to apply these products as safely as possible.

4. The decrease in potential risk from restricting use of these products will exceed any incidental decrease in their
benefits. The Agency believes that restricted use classification will not significantly increase the cost of sewer
root control treatment. Because there are other substantially similar products available which will be classified
for restricted use when the applicator training program is completed, there will be little benefit to the public from
having one product on the market with much higher risks than the others at comparable cost. The need for root control
in sewer lines will continue to be met by the other products with less potential for adverse effects.


B. Risk-Benefit Assessment


There is a significant potential for serious harm to humans and the environment due to the improper application of
these products. The Agency cannot adequately mitigate this potential risk through cautionary labeling alone because
the products' application method requires specialized equipment and training. The best way EPA can ensure that all
product applicators are sufficiently skilled to prevent harm to humans and the environment, to the greatest extent
possible, is to require all persons who apply these products to be properly trained certified applicators or under
the direct supervision of such certified applicators.
There are currently three other registrants marketing products which are substantially similar to the Airrigation
products. Each of these companies agreed upon registration of its product to participate in developing a training
program for sewer treatment applicators, and to label its sewer treatment products for restricted use once the program
is made available to the States. EPA believes that the cost of these products is comparable to that of Airrigation's
products since the amount of chemicals (active ingredients), the percentage and quality of foaming ingredients
are all very similar. The other registrants have indicated to EPA that they do not expect restricted use classification
to increase the cost of their products to the public. EPA also believes that these companies' products, and any new
products to enter the market in the future, will be sufficient to meet the public demand for sewer root treatment. In
performing this function, they will pose less overall risk to the public than the Airrigation products because they
will be used only by or under the direct supervision of properly trained certified applicators.

Therefore, in comparison to other available alternatives, the Airrigation products pose serious risks and provide
negligible benefits, if any. Unless these products are classified for restricted use under the same phased approach
as the other registrants' products, they will no longer meet the statutory standard for registration. 


C. Measures Short of Cancellation


Under FIFRA, prior to taking regulatory action to cancel a pesticide's registration, the Administrator must consider
whether any measures short of cancellation would be sufficient to reduce the risk of adverse effects to an acceptable
level. As discussed above, the Agency has determined that restricted use classification would reduce the potential
risks of these products to humans and the environment to an acceptable level. That was the basis for EPA's letter of
September 24, 1993 to Airrigation. Airrigation refused to comply with the Agency's decision. Accordingly, there
are no other measures short of cancellation which would reduce the potential risks from these products to an acceptable
level. In order to avoid cancellation, Airrigation must amend the registrations of these products so that they will
be classified for restricted use upon issuance of the applicator training program. Additional information on avoiding
cancellation can be obtained from the Office of Pesticide Program personnel listed in the section above under the
heading ``For Further Information Contact.''


IV. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture



Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) to review and comment upon a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel, and
in the case of USDA, an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may
be waived, and if they are, the Notice may be published without delay.

On May 2, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and the Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs.
12 and 13). These requests were made because the bases for this notice are regulatory in nature due to the need for specialized
training, and specialized application and protective equipment when using these products. Therefore, a science
finding is not required. Moreover, the use of these products does not involve agricultural commodities. On May 23,
1994, the SAP notified EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 14). On May 12, 1994, Nancy N. Ragsdale, Director,
National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program, USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review
of this action (Ref. 15). Because USDA and SAP have waived their review of this action, the Agency is not delaying issuance
of this Notice. 


V. Agency Determination that Cancellation of Airrigation Engineering's Products is Necessary


EPA has determined that the Airrigation sewer treatment products listed above, without being classified for restricted
use, fail to meet the standard for registration under FIFRA for the reasons listed below, and that the registrations
of these products must be canceled.

1. These products pose a serious hazard, due to their acute and developmental toxicity and their complicated and difficult
application methods, which could be adequately mitigated through restricted use classification.

2. There are adequate alternative products which will be classified for restricted use (when the certified applicator
training program is available to the States) which will perform the same function and provide the same benefits while
posing significantly lower risks.

3. EPA has informed Airrigation of this determination pursuant to 40 CFR 152.65(c)(2), and Airrigation has refused
to comply with the Agency's decision.



VI. Disposition of Existing Stocks


For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of Vaporooter A Foaming Fumigant (EPA Reg.
No. 99931), Foam Coat Vaporooter (EPA Reg. No 9993-2), and Sanafoam Vaporooter II (EPA Reg. No. 9993-3) which were
in the United States and were packaged and labeled for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation of the
registrations of these products. The Agency has determined that no further sale, distribution, or use of existing
stocks of these products will be permitted after the effective date of cancellation of the registration of the product,
except for distribution for the purposes of disposal. Owners of existing stocks of the products may at any time dispose
of the product in accordance with applicable local, State, and Federal regulations. The determination is based on
the finding that continued use of these products without restricted use classification may result in unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. 


VII. Procedural Matters


This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registration of Airrigation Engineering Co., Inc., products containing
metam-sodium for use in treating sewer lines, and any product with any of the registration numbers listed above that
is supplementally distributed. This action is taken pursuant to authority in section 6(b) of FIFRA. Under FIFRA section
6(b)(1), registrants and other adversely affected parties may request a hearing on the cancellation actions that
this Notice initiates. Any hearing concerning cancellation of registration for any affected pesticide product
will be held in accordance with FIFRA section 6(d). Unless a hearing is properly requested in accordance with the provisions
of this Notice, the registration will be canceled. This unit of the Notice explains how such persons may request a hearing
in accordance with the procedures specified in this Notice, and the consequences of requesting or failing to request
a hearing. 


A. Procedures for Requesting a Hearing


To contest the regulatory action initiated by this Notice, registrants or other adversely affected persons must
request a hearing within 30 days of the registrant's receipt of this Notice, or within 30 days from the date of publication
of this Notice in the 

Federal Register

, whichever occurs later. All registrants and other adversely affected persons who request a hearing must file the
request in accordance with the procedures established by FIFRA and EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings (40
CFR part 164). These procedures require that all requests must identify the specific registration by Registration
Number and state the basis for objecting to the cancellation of the product for which a hearing is requested, and must
be received by the Hearing Clerk within the applicable 30-day period. Failure to comply with these requirements will
result in denial of the request for a hearing. Requests for a hearing should also be accompanied by objections that
are specific to each basis of cancellation of the pesticide product for which a hearing is requested.
Requests for a hearing must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW.,
Washington, DC 20460.
1. 

Consequences of filing a timely and effective hearing request

. If a hearing on any action initiated by this Notice is requested in a timely and effective manner, the hearing will
be governed by EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings under FIFRA section 6 (40 CFR part 164).
2. 

Consequences of failure to file in a timely and effective manner

. If a hearing concerning the cancellation of a specific product subject to this Notice is not requested in a timely
and effective manner by the end of the applicable 30-day period, registration of that product will be canceled automatically.


B. Separation of Functions


EPA's rules of practice forbid anyone who may take part in deciding this case, at any stage of the proceeding, from discussing
the merits of the proceeding ex parte with any party or with any person who has been connected with the preparation or
presentation of the proceeding as an advocate or in any investigative or expert capacity, or with any of his/her representatives
(40 CFR 164.7).
Accordingly, the following EPA offices, and the staffs thereof, are designated as the judicial staff of EPA in any
administrative hearing on this Notice of Intent to Cancel: the Office of Administrative Law Judge, the Environmental
Appeals Board, the Deputy Administrator and the members of the staff of the immediate office of the Deputy Administrator,
and the Administrator and the members of staff in the immediate office of the Administrator. The following offices
are designated as the trial staff in any proceeding which may arise under this Notice: the Office of General Counsel,
the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances and his/her immediate
staff, the Office of Pesticide Programs, and the Office of Compliance Monitoring. None of the persons designated
as the judicial staff may have any ex parte communications with the trial staff or any other interested person not employed
by EPA on the merits of any of the issues involved in these proceedings, without fully complying with the applicable
regulations.

ACTION:

 Response to citizens' petition. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 4, 1994, Mr. Mark Truelock (Petitioner), of Del City, Oklahoma, sent a letter to the Administrator of EPA designated
as a petition under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2620. Enclosed with that letter
was a copy of an earlier letter, dated November 26, 1993, also designated as a section 21 Petition. The Petition describes
problems Mr. Truelock has experienced over the years in seeking relief from periodic overflowing of raw sewage from
a drainage ditch adjacent to his house. The problem described is not amenable to solution by remedies provided by section
21 of TSCA, nor does Petitioner request such action. In December of 1993, in response to earlier correspondence, EPA
Region 6 informed Petitioner of actions already taken under the Clean Water Act to resolve the problem. Therefore,
Petition is denied because no action authorized under TSCA section 21 has been requested. Specifically, Petitioner
has not sought rulemaking under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under TSCA section 5(e) or 6(b)(2). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Statutory Requirements 


Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for issuance of rules under sections
4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. A section 21 petition must set forth facts which the petitioner believes establish the need for the
rules requested. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition, the Agency
must promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish its reasons
in the 

Federal Register

. 
Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel initiation of
the requested rulemaking. For petition for a new rule or order, the court must provide opportunity for the petition
to be considered de novo. After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the requested action. 
Relief available under section 21 is limited to initiation of a proceeding to issue, amend, or appeal a rule under section
4, 6, or 8, or an order under section 5(e) or 6(b)(2). 


II. Description of Petition and Related Events 


EPA received an April 4, 1994, letter from Petitioner labeled ``TSCA-21.'' That letter provided no details
and requested no action, but simply asserted that EPA had failed to respond to a Petition on December 6, 1993. The Agency
has no record of correspondence from Petitioner dated December 6th. The April 4 letter was accompanied by a second
letter, dated November 26, 1993, but first received with the April letter that is also designated as a TSCA section
21 petition. The petition does not expressly request any action, but instead recounts Petitioner's experiences
in seeking relief from a chronically overflowing drainage ditch that runs adjacent to his property line. The petition
also references and notes that EPA had not responded to an earlier July 14, 1993 letter on the same matter Petitioner
had sent to the EPA Region 6 Office in Dallas, Texas. The July 14 letter chronicled Petitioner's experiences in seeking
relief from the Del City authorities, stated his intent to be compensated for past damages, and referred to three sections
(308, 309, and 326) of the Clean Water Act. While neither the section 21 Petition nor the July 14, 1993 letter request
any specific actions from EPA, the Agency believes it is reasonable to infer from both that Petitioner seeks action
to prevent the drainage ditch from periodically overflowing into his home. 
In fact, EPA's Region 6 Office did respond to Petitioner's July letter on December 7, 1993. That response noted efforts
made by EPA, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, and Del City to correct the collection system deficiencies;
informed Petitioner that EPA had issued an Administrative Order in February of 1992, requiring the Del City Municipal
Service Authority to complete construction of the collection system improvements by the end of 1993 (Docket No. VI-921246);
and concluded by suggesting that Petitioner inform the Del City Municipal Service Authority and/or EPA if sanitation
sewer overflows occurred after that date, providing specific information on location(s), date/time(s), and circumstances
of such events. 


III. Disposition of Petition 


The petition is denied because it did not request rulemaking under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under TSCA section
5(e) or 6(b)(2).
The problem described, moreover, is not amenable to those authorities. Notwithstanding denial of the petition,
the Agency has investigated Petitioner's complaints and provided relief. The problem described by Petitioner is
being addressed by EPA Region 6 under the Clean Water Act, and Petitioner has been expressly requested to bring any
further occurrences of the problem to the attention of the Del City Municipal Authority and/or the EPA Regional Office.
Petitioner has not reported on, nor is the Agency aware of, any incidents that have occurred after December 31, 1993.



IV. Administrative Record 


EPA has established a public record of those documents the Agency considered in reviewing this petition. The record
consists of documents located in the file designated by Docket Number/Administrative Record Number OPPTS-211039,
located at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center NCIC. This docket is available for inspection from 12 noon
to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center, Rm. NE-B607,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The public record consists of all documents in the OPPTS file and all documents
cited in the documents in that file.

<DOCTITLE>Norwest Corporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Request for Relief from a Commitment</DOCTITLE>


Norwest Corporation, Minneapolis, Minnesota (Norwest), a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding
Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1841 et seq., has requested that the Board grant to it relief from a commitment that it made in
connection with the Board's approval of Norwest's application to underwrite and deal in certain securities to a limited
extent through Norwest Investment Services, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota (NISI). 

Norwest Corporation

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 79 (1990) 

(Norwest Order)

. In the 

Norwest Order

, the Board authorized Norwest to underwrite and deal in, among other things, municipal revenue bonds pursuant to
the prudential limitations and other conditions set forth in 

Citicorp, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, and Bankers Trust New York Corporation

, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987) as modified by 

Order Approving Modifications to Section 20 Orders

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 751 (1989).
Among the conditions to which Norwest is subject pursuant to the 

Norwest Order

 is that the municipal revenue bonds underwritten by NISI must be rated as investment quality (

i.e.

, in one of the top four categories) by a nationally recognized rating agency. Norwest has requested limited relief
from this condition to allow NISI to underwrite issues of municipal revenue bonds that are not rated by a nationally
recognized rating agency so long as each issue of unrated bonds does not exceed $7.5 million.
Norwest supports its request for relief by contending that it is not cost effective for municipalities to obtain ratings
for smaller issues of municipal revenue bonds. Norwest asserts that NISI's participation in underwriting these
unrated municipal revenue bonds will benefit the communities that issue the bonds by providing additional competition
in the market for this service. Norwest believes that the systems and procedures that it has in place to evaluate the
creditworthiness of these issues should substantially mitigate any risk that may be associated with the underwriting
of these bonds.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the request.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than October 11, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Minneapolis
(James M. Lyon, Vice President) 250 Marquette Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55480.

Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)
of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to commence or to engage 

de novo

, either directly or through a subsidiary, in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely

The application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
Comments regarding the application must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated or the offices of the Board of Governors
not later than October 11, 1994.

Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Semprex

TM

-D Capsules


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Semprex

TM

-D Capsules and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination
because of the submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce,
for the extension of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Semprex

TM

-D Capsules. Semprex

TM

-D Capsules (acrivastine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride) is indicated for relief of symptoms associated with
seasonal allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, pruritus, lacrimation, and nasal congestion. Subsequent
to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Semprex

TM

-D Capsules (U.S. Patent No. 4,650,807) from Burroughs Wellcome Co., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested
FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated July
8, 1994, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Semprex

TM

-D Capsules represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the
Patent and Trademark Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Semprex

TM

-D Capsules is 3,489 days. Of this time, 1,210 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period,
while 2,279 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: September 6, 1984. The Applicant claims August 13, 1984, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was September 6, 1984, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND. 
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: December 29, 1987. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the New Drug Application (NDA) for Semprex

TM

-D Capsules (NDA 19-806) was initially submitted on December 29, 1987.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: March 25, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 19-806 was approved on March 25, 1994.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,469 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before November 21, 1994, submit to
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any
interested person may petition FDA, on or before March 20, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant
for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. 
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>New Drug Applications; Refusal to File; Change in Schedule of Meetings of the Review Committee</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
 AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
 ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a change in the procedure that the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research (CDER) uses to review its use of its refusal to file (RTF) procedure, by which it refuses to file new drug
applications (NDA's) that are facially deficient under FDA's regulations. Since January 1994, the committee has
been meeting bi-monthly rather than quarterly. Because the committee will review all RTF decisions rather than only
a few, new drug application (NDA) applicants will not need to submit requests for review. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA regulations on filing applications, including grounds and procedures for refusals to file, are found in 21 CFR
314.101. In the past, some review divisions in CDER have refused to file applications only where the deficiencies
were extreme, e.g., the total omission of a section required by 21 CFR 314.50, or the absence of any study even arguably
adequate and well controlled, while others have applied this regulation more broadly.



In the 

Federal Register

 of May 18, 1993 (58 FR 28983), FDA announced the establishment and first regular meeting of a standing committee in
CDER to conduct periodic review of CDER's RTF procedure. CDER established the RTF review committee to periodically
review RTF decisions to assess their scientific and procedural quality. The RTF review committee consists of senior
CDER officials, a senior official from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and FDA's Chief Mediator
and Ombudsman. The committee reviews, among other things, the consistency of RTF practices across new drug evaluation
offices and divisions, the need for additional guidance on NDA content and format, and the need to modify FDA's RTF
policy. The committee was established on a 1-year trial basis and scheduled to meet quarterly for that year. The committee
has held two pilot meetings and several regular meetings since the publication of that notice. For each of the pilot
meetings and for the first two of the regular meetings, FDA invited NDA applicants to use the committee's confidential
mechanism to request review of any RTF decision during the preceding 12 months. RTF decisions reviewed by the committee
were chosen for review by the Office of the FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman through a combination of random selection
and selection from among those submitted by NDA applicants for review. 
The RTF review committee has decided to change its procedures from those presented in the 

Federal Register

 of May 18, 1993 (58 FR 28983). Since January 1994, the committee has been meeting every other month (six times a year)
and reviews all the RTF decisions that CDER makes, rather than only some of them.
There are two primary reasons for this change. One reason is that the number of applications with RTF decisions each
month has decreased over the past year, so that it is feasible for the committee to review all such applications rather
than only selected applications. The second reason is that RTF decisions have additional effects related to user
fees. Under section 736(a)(1)(D) of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (21 U.S.C.  379h(a)(1)(D)),
FDA is authorized to retain 25 percent of the total user fee assessed for each NDA that is refused for filing. If the agency
incorrectly refuses to file an application, the error needs to be promptly identified and corrected, so that the application
may be filed and a review initiated, and the retained fees may be returned to the applicant. The review of all RTF decisions
on a bimonthly basis will allow the agency to identify incorrect RTF decisions and take corrective measures in a timely
manner.
Under this new procedure, NDA applicants will no longer need to submit requests for committee review to the Office
of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. Applicants may continue to contact that office, however, to discuss concerns
regarding refusal to file and other issues, as needed.
The committee believes that this change in its approach to reviewing RTF decisions will facilitate the agency's efforts
to promote the timely, efficient, and consistent review of NDA's. After 1 year, the value of the bimonthly committee
review of all RTF applications will be assessed.
Because the committee's deliberations will deal with confidential commercial information, the RTF review meetings
are closed to the public. Summaries of the committee's deliberations, excluding all such confidential commercial
information, will be available from the FDA Chief Mediator and Ombudsman. If, following the committee's review,
an RTF decision changes, the reviewing division will notify the applicant of the change.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of fund availability (NOFA) for fiscal year (FY) 1994 for the Family Unification Program; Correction.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44542), the Department published a NOFA to announce the availability of FY 94 budget authority
for section 8 rental certificates under the Family Unification Program. This document makes a correction to Section
II(D) of the NOFA, which concerns the selection process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44542), the Department published a NOFA to announce the availability of FY 94 budget authority
for section 8 rental certificates under the Family Unification Program. The purpose of the Family Unification program
is to provide housing assistance to families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in the separation,
or imminent separation, of children from their families.


Section II(D) of the August 29, 1994 NOFA, which addresses the selection process, inadvertently omitted a sentence
that advises of action that the Department may take in order to achieve geographic diversity. This document corrects
Section II(D) of the NOFA to include this sentence.
Accordingly, the following correction is made to FR 94-21166, published on August 29, 1994, at 59 FR 44542;


Section II_[Corrected]


1. On page 44545, in the first column, under subsection (D) entitled ``Selection Process,'' the second paragraph
under this subsection (the paragraph which follows the six numbered items) is corrected to add a sentence at the end
of this paragraph to read as follows:


(D) Selection Process


* * * * *


Headquarters will select eligible HAs to be funded based on a lottery. All HAs identified by the HUD Offices as meeting
the Threshold Criteria identified in the NOFA will be eligible for the lottery selection process. As HAs are selected,
the costs of funding the applications will be counted against the total funds available for the Family Unification
program. In order to achieve a geographic diversity, HUD Headquarters will limit the number of applications selected
for funding under the lottery for any State to fifteen percent of the budget authority made available under this NOFA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


A. Introduction 


The DOI, as lead Federal Agency on behalf of the EVOS Trustee Council, has prepared a Final EIS on a proposal to construct
infrastructure improvements to the IMS in Seward, Alaska. The EVOS Trustee Council is considering providing funding
for a portion of this project. The Council is comprised of the designees of the Administrator, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration; the Secretary of Agriculture; the Secretary of Interior; and the Commissioner of the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game; the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; and
the Alaska Attorney General. The EVOS Trustee Council is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of
injuries, uses of the joint restoration funds, and all restoration activities relating to the proposed project.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Final EIS presents analyses of the environmental_including
social and economic_effects that would be anticipated if the proposed improvements to the IMS in Seward were to occur
as presently envisioned. In addition, the EIS assesses the effects of an alternative to the proposal that would eliminate
the public education and visitation component, and construct only a research and wildlife rehabilitation component.
Lastly, a no action alternative is assessed to determine the effects on the environment should the proposed improvements
not be made. 


B. The Proposed IMS Infrastructure Improvement Project 


The EVOS Trustee Council is proposing to improve the existing infrastructure at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks
IMS in Seward, Alaska, to enhance the EVOS Trustee Council's capabilities to study marine mammals, marine birds,
and the ecosystem injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The improvements are intended to help focus and carry out a
long-term research and monitoring program for the EVOS area as part of an overall restoration plan. The project would
be constructed adjacent to the existing campus of the IMS Seward Marine Center, and would have two components: (1)
a research and wildlife rehabilitation component and (2) a public education and visitation component. 
The research and wildlife rehabilitation component would consist of approximately 22,000 square feet of interior
space comprised of wet and dry laboratories, staff offices, and a library for studies and rehabilitation of marine
mammals, marine birds, and other wildlife. There also would be approximately 46,000 square feet of exterior space
containing outdoor research habitat, tanks, and pools for pinnipeds, sea otters, and marine bird species. A 50-space,
37,000 square foot, parking lot for staff vehicles would be constructed adjacent to the existing IMS Rae Building
parking lot. A research vessel and submersible may be acquired for research purposes. 
The public education and visitation component would include approximately 20,000 square feet of additional interior
space to promote public awareness of the marine environment. It would function in concert with, and in support of,
the research and wildlife rehabilitation component. This component would include exhibits, interpretive displays,
and public areas. A 166-space, 90,000 square foot, parking lot for visitors would be built adjacent to the education
and visitor component. No joint EVOS restoration funds would be involved in the construction or maintenance of the
public education and visitation component. 
The two components would share approximately 27,000 square feet of interior building-support space, including
the life support system and the facility's mechanical, administrative, and curatorial functions. 
Funding for the proposed project would come, in large part, from EVOS funds. Overall, the total project capital budget
is anticipated to be approximately $47.5 million, of which approximately $37.5 million would come from EVOS funds.
Twelve and one-half million dollars of State EVOS restitution funds were appropriated by the Alaska Legislature
in 1993 to the City of Seward for the planning, design, and construction of the proposed project. In addition, approximately
$25 million of EVOS monies have been requested to fund the research and wildlife rehabilitation component of the proposed
project. Lastly, it is anticipated that approximately $10 million would be raised privately to fund the public education
and visitation component of the proposed project. Revenue from public education and visitation would be used to help
offset the operational costs of all of the proposed improvements. 


C. The NEPA Process 


On March 9, 1994, the DOI, as lead Federal Agency on behalf of the EVOS Trustee Council, published a Notice of Intent
to prepare an EIS on the Proposed IMS Infrastructure Improvement Project (59 FR 11082-1183). Scoping commenced
on that date. Scoping meetings were held in Seward and Anchorage, Alaska, on March 22 and 24, 1994, respectively. Public
notices announcing these meetings and requesting comments were published in 
EVOS-area newspapers; and a scoping newsletter was distributed widely throughout the EVOS area and beyond. In addition
to comments and suggestions received at the scoping meetings, over 300 written responses were received. These comments
were evaluated by the DOI and form the basis for the topics, issues, and alternatives addressed in the EIS. 
A 45-day public comment period on the Draft EIS followed the 
June 24, 1994, publication of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

 
(59 FR 32697). The public comment period ended on August 8, 1994. Public hearings on the Draft EIS were held in Seward
and Anchorage, Alaska, respectively, on July 26 and 28, 1994. A total of four individuals presented testimony at these
hearings. A total of 31 comment letters were received on the Draft EIS_eight from Federal Agencies, four from state
agencies, one from the City of Seward, three from groups or organizations, and 15 from individuals. Most of the comments
on the Draft EIS addressed concerns regarding: (1) traffic and transportation, (2) quality of life in and near Seward,
(3) recreation resources, (4) archaeological and historic resources, (5) the possible Alaska Marine Highway ferry
relocation, and (6) the feasibility of the proposed project. Comments regarding project propriety have been referred
to the EVOS Trustee Council for its consideration. Although the use of EVOS settlement funds is a significant issue
to be addressed with public input, it is not an environmental issue and, thus, is not analyzed in the EIS. All written
and oral comments on the Draft EIS were reviewed, and responses were prepared for 231 comments. The Final EIS reflects
revisions made as a result of public comments received. The effect levels predicted in the Draft EIS did not change
for the Final EIS. 
A Record of Decision will be issued no earlier than 30 days after EPA's Notice of Availability for the Final EIS appears
in the 

Federal Register

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Redding Resource Area's, Resource Management Plan (RMP) identifies overall objectives and provides broad direction
for public land management within the Redding Resource Area. The RMP directs BLM to maintain semi-primitive recreation
opportunities in the Upper Ridge Nature Preserve. The RMP also directs BLM to enhance non-motorized recreation opportunities
by establishing a greenway along Clear Creek within the Horsetown/Clear Creek Nature Preserve. Both recreation
areas are being managed by cooperative stewardship groups.




The camping, firearm shooting and off-road vehicles riding closures are necessary to protect human and natural resources
within the fragile recreation areas. Camping is defined as overnight occupancy of the public lands. Possession or
use of tents, vehicles, or other shelter is not required to meet the definition of camping under this order. Firearm
shooting is defined as the discharge of a weapon by any person. Off-road vehicle driving is defined as the operation
of any motorized vehicle (excluding motorized wheelchairs) in any area other than established and signed parking
areas and roads.

The closure orders are applicable throughout the entire year. Individuals or groups may be permitted to camp on public
lands within the two recreation areas if they are conducting work in connection with the stewardship groups and have
authorization from BLM. BLM employees conducting field work are excluded from the off-road vehicle closure as are
other individuals conducting work authorized by BLM. Private landowners with inholdings encompassed by the Horsetown/Clear
Creek Nature Preserve and/or mining claimants may be given authorization to travel over existing roads located on
public lands.

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given related to the emergency use restriction of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administered lands
in accordance with regulations contained in 43 CFR 8364.1 (a). This action affects approximately 300 acres of public
land comprising the Samoa Dunes Recreation Area (T5N, R1W, Section 31; T4N, R1W, Section 6, Humboldt Base & Meridian).
These public lands will be closed to all vehicle use 1/2 hour following sunset to 1/2 hour after sunrise. Employees,
agents and permittees of the BLM may be exempt from this restriction as determined by the authorized officer.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of restricting vehicle use at night in this particular area is to protect persons, property and public
land and resources. During the past year, there has been a significant increase in vandalism, theft of property and
other illegal activities during the evening and early morning hours, all of which have been associated with the use
of vehicles. Restricting vehicle use to only daytime hours will substantially reduce these illegal activities from
occurring.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of the opportunity for the public to review and comment on the draft final report of the ITFM.
The title of the draft report is ``The Nationwide Strategy for Improving Water-Quality Monitoring.'' The report
is available by request to the address below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established in Memorandum No. 92-01, dated December 10, 1991, the
requirements to conduct a nationwide review and evaluation of water-quality monitoring and to recommend needed
improvements. The ITFM is a partnership of representatives from Federal, State, Native American, and interstate
governmental organizations. Working since January 1992 in consultation with representatives of other public and
private organizations, the ITFM is developing an integrated, nationwide, voluntary strategy for water-quality
monitoring. The proposed strategy and associated recommendations to improve water-quality monitoring are presented
in the draft final report that is now available for review. Water resources considered in the strategy include surface
water and ground water, near-coastal waters, associated aquatic communities and habitats, wetlands, and sediments.
The five general purposes of water-quality monitoring identified in the report include characterizing status and
trends, identifying and ranking in order of priority existing and emerging problems, designing and implementing
programs and projects, evaluating program success and project compliance, and responding to emergencies. The scope
of the ITFM proposals addresses physical, chemical (including toxicological), and biological (including habitat
and ecological) aspects of water-quality monitoring. The monitoring functions considered in the strategy include
the full range of activities from identifying monitoring objectives, planning and designing monitoring programs,
conducting field sampling and laboratory analysis, interpreting and reporting monitoring results, to evaluating
the effectiveness of monitoring efforts. The ITFM will complete the report by January 1995, and will distribute copies
to the OMB, Federal agencies in the Executive Branch, Congress, Governors and others as requested or as appropriate.

Certain Devices for Connecting Computers via Telephone Lines; Notice of Request for Additional Written Submissions
on the Scope of a Proposed Exclusion Order 


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission seeks additional written submissions on the
scope of a proposed exclusion order that may be issued in the above-captioned investigation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') filed a complaint on October 12, 1993, pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), alleging that certain respondents had violated section 337 in the importation into the
United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain devices
for connecting computers via telephone lines. The Commission published a notice of investigation in the 

Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60671). 



On June 28, 1994, the Commission determined not to review a final initial determination issued by the presiding administrative
law judge finding a violation of section 337 in this investigation. The Commission requested written submissions
on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. See 59 FR 34862-63 (July 7, 1994). Both complainant
Farallon and the Commission investigative attorney proposed that the Commission issue a general exclusion order
that ``excluded from entry into the United States,'' devices for connecting computers via telephone lines that are
covered by claims 10, 18, or 20 of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579, for the remaining term of the patent, except under
license of the patent owner or as provided by law. 

In connection with recent deliberations concerning the scope of the exclusion order issued in 1984 in Inv. Nos. 337-TA-148/169,
Certain Processes for the Manufacture of Skinless Sausage Casings and Resulting Product, the Commission became
aware that the U.S. Customs Service interprets the term ``exclusion from entry'' differently from a majority of the
Commission. The Commission therefore wishes to avoid any ambiguity inherent in the use of this term by stating more
precisely in any exclusion order that may be issued exactly what is and is not covered by the order. 



Written Submissions



The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, in particular the U.S. Customs Service, and any
other interested persons are encouraged to file written submissions on the scope of the proposed exclusion order
and in particular on the use of the terms ``exclusion from entry'' and ``entry.'' Such written submissions must be
filed no later than the close of business on Monday, October 3, 1994. 

Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies
thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the
Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such
treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must
include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. 

See

 19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly.
All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary.


This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and section
210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.58). 

Copies of Farallon's and the Commission investigative attorney's proposed exclusion orders and all other nonconfidential
documents filed in connection with this investigation are available for inspection during official business hours
(8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington,
D.C. 20436, telephone 202-205-2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter
can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202-205-1810.


 

Issued: September 13, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice seeking comments on the issue of whether employees affected by a purchase transaction may have test period
averages (TPAs).

1








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is considering a request by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) that the Commission
interpret its labor conditions as requiring a railroad employer to furnish upon request TPAs to employees affected
by the sale of a rail line on which the employees work. Comments are invited on the issue.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An Arbitration Board found that nothing in the express wording of, or the industry practice under, the 

New York Dock 

conditions

2 

requires a railroad to provide affected employees their TPAs until they have been ``adversely'' affected as a result
of the purchase transaction, and thus concluded that the railroad is not obligated to provide that information except
in connection with the calculation of displacement allowances under our labor conditions. 




On appeal to the Commission, BMWE argues that the information permits affected employees to determine if they have
been ``adversely affected,'' 

i.e.

, placed in a worse position as a result of a transaction and thereby entitled to a displacement allowance. BMWE notes
in this regard that equally important to total compensation is the amount of time the employee had to work to receive
it. 
Second, BMWE avers that the TPA is necessary for employees to comply with the requirement of Article I, section 5 that
they exercise seniority to seek a position producing compensation equal to or exceeding the compensation received
in their prior position. Without the TPA information, the union says that employees are unable to determine which
positions produce equal compensation. Soo Line Railroad Company, on the other hand, argues that the information
is readily available to employees, is burdensome for the railroad to provide and ought not to be required. 
The Commission believes it would be helpful to have additional comment on these issues from the parties as well as the
interested public. 
Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To purchase a copy of the full decision, write
to, call, or pick up in person from: Dynamic Concepts, Inc., Room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building,
Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available
through TDD services: (202) 927-5721.] 
This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. 



Decided: September 9, 1994.

 (58 FR 40468, dated July 28, 1993). This standard, which is contained in Chapter 88 of the Code of Iowa (1983), was promulgated

The standard was effective October 27, 1993; and notice of its adoption was published by the State on October 27, 1993.



2. Decision



Having reviewed the State submission in comparison with the Federal standards, it has been determined that the State
standards are identical to the comparable Federal standards and should therefore be approved.



3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying



A copy of the standard supplement, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Directorate of Federal/State Operations, Office of State Programs, Room N3700,
200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210; Office of the Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, 406 Federal Office Building, 911 Walnut Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; and Division
of Labor Services, 1000 East Grand Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50319.



4. Public Participation



Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this Chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite
the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds
that good cause exists for not publishing the supplement to the Iowa State Plan as a proposed change and for making the
Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reasons:

1. The standards are identical to the comparable Federal standards and are therefore deemed to be at least as effective.

2. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation
and notice would be unnecessary.

This decision is effective September 21, 1994.

Part 1953 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and
Health (hereinafter called the Regional Administrator), under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary
of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary) (29 CFR 1953.4), will review
and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State plan which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c)
of the Act and 29 CFR Part 1902. On July 5, 1973, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (38 FR 17834) of the approval of the Maryland State plan and the adoption of Subpart O to Part 1952 containing the decision.

The Maryland State plan provides for the adoption of all Federal standards as State standards after comments and public
hearing. Section 1952.210 of Subpart O sets forth the State's schedule for the adoption of Federal standards. By letters
dated May 16 and July 25, 1994, from Commissioner Henry Koellein, Jr., Maryland Division of Labor and Industry, to
Linda R. Anku, Regional Administrator, and incorporated as part of the plan, the State submitted State standards
identical to amendments, corrections, and revisions to: (1) 29 CFR 1926.63, pertaining to the Occupational Exposure
to Cadmium Standard for the Construction Industry as published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 3, 1994 (59 FR 1920); (2) 29 CFR 1910.1200, including Appendices A through D, pertaining to the Hazard Communication
Standard as published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6169); and (3) 29 CFR 1910.269, including Appendices A through E, pertaining to the Electronic
Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Standard and related changes to 29 CFR 1910.37, 1910.331, and 1910.333
as published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 31, 1994 (59 FR 4435). These standards are contained in COMAR 09.12.31. Maryland occupational safety and
health standards were promulgated after public hearings on March 4 and June 15, 1994. The Cadmium Standard became
effective on May 9, 1994, and the Hazard Communication and Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution
standards became effective on July 4, 1994.




2. Decision



Having reviewed the State submissions in comparison with the Federal standards, it has been determined that the State
standards are identical to the Federal standards and, accordingly, are approved.



3. Location of the Supplements for Inspection and Copying



A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, 3535 Market Street, Suite 2100, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19104; Office of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, 501 St. Paul Place, Baltimore, Maryland 21202:
and the OSHA Office of State Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N3700, 3rd Street and Constitution Avenue, NW.,
Washington, DC 20210.



4. Public Participation



Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing the supplement to the Maryland State plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's

a. The standard is identical to the Federal standard which was promulgated in accordance with Federal law including
meeting requirements for public participation.

b. The standard was adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further participation
would be unnecessary.

This decision is effective September 21, 1994.

review and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State Plan, which has been approved in accordance with Section
18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR Part 1902. On October 16, 1973, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (38 FR 28658) of the approval of the Vermont State Plan and the adoption of Subpart U to Part 1952 containing the decision.
The Vermont State Plan provides for the adoption of Federal standards as State standards after:
a. Publishing for two (2) successive weeks, in three (3) newspapers having general circulation in the center, northern
and southern parts of the State, an intent to amend the State Plan by adopting the standard(s).
b. Review of standards by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules, State of Vermont.
c. Approval by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, State of Vermont.
d. Filing in the Office of the Secretary of State, State of Vermont.
e. The Secretary of State publishing, not less than quarterly, a bulletin of all standard(s) adopted by the State.
The Vermont State Plan provides for the adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable Federal
standards promulgated under Section 6 of the Act. By letter dated June 2, 1994, from Mary S. Hooper, Commissioner,
Vermont Department of Labor and Industry, to John B. Miles, Jr., Regional Administrator; and incorporated as part
of the plan, the State submitted updated State standards identical to 29 CFR Parts 1910, and 1926, and subsequent amendments
thereto, as described below:
(1) Revision to 29 CFR Parts 1910, Safety and Health Standards: Welding, Cutting and Brazing; Final Rule (55 FR 13696,
dated 4/11/90).
(2) Addition to 29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926, Incorporation of General Industry Safety and Health Standards applicable
to Construction Work and Technical Amendments; Final Rules (58 FR 35077, dated 6/30/93).
These standards became effective on May 12, 1994, pursuant to Section 224 of State Law.


2. Decision


The above State standards have been reviewed and compared with the relevant Federal standard. It has been determined
that the State standard is identical to the Federal standard, and is accordingly approved.


3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying


A copy of the standards supplement, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business
hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, 133 Portland Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02114; Office of the Commissioner, State of Vermont, Department of Labor and Industry, 120 State Street, Montpelier,
Vermont 05602; and the Office of State Programs, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-3700, Washington, DC 20210.


4. Public Participation


Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process
or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause
exists for not publishing the supplement to the Vermont State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's
approval effective upon publication for the following reason:
1. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of the State Law which included public
comment, and further public participation would be repetitious.
This decision is effective September 21, 1994.





Authority:

 Sec. 18, Pub. L. 91-596, 84 Stat. 1608 (29 U.S.C. 667).

Dairyland Power Cooperative; La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor (LACBWR); Confirmatory Order Modifying NRC Order
Authorizing Decommissioning of Facility



I



The Dairyland Power Cooperative (DPC, the licensee) is the holder of Facility License No. DPR-45, originally
issued by the Atomic Energy Commission, the predecessor to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission)
pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 on August 28, 1973. The licensee's authority to operate DPR-45 was terminated by license
Amendment No. 56, dated August 4, 1987. The licensee is authorized to possess but not to operate the La Crosse Boiling
Water Reactor (LACBWR) in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The facility is located on the licensee's
site located 19 miles south of La Crosse, Wisconsin.



II



In its Order (Decommissioning Order) of August 7, 1991, the NRC directed DPC to decommission the reactor facility
in accordance with its Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's regulations. This action was taken in response
to the licensee's application for authorization to decommission the facility, dated December 21, 1987, as revised
February 22, 1988, September 9, 1988, September 30, 1988, January 26, 1989, March 28, 1989, June 6, 1989, October 3,
1989, July 25, 1990, May 10, 1991, and July 25, 1991. Neither the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning Order, which authorized
the licensee to decommission the reactor facility, nor the approved Decommissioning Plan, contained an approved
procedure that would allow the licensee to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning
Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval.



III


The licensee, in its letters of August 2, and August 5, 1994, requested the NRC to modify the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning
Order to allow DPC to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning Plan; and
(ii) conduct tests and experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval.
The licensee, as other licensees of both operating facilities and facilities in the process of being decommissioned,
continues to discover facility improvements which, if implemented, would either reduce facility operating costs,
improve facility safety margins, or are necessary for continued operation/maintenance of the facility. Further,
a large number of these licensee-initiated facility improvements, if implemented, would neither increase the probability
of an accident occurring, increase the consequences of an accident, reduce safety margins, or create a significant
environmental impact not previously evaluated. Thus, in these circumstances, for the NRC to require a licensee to
first receive NRC approval prior to the implementation of facility improvements that meets the above criteria would
cause an unnecessary burden on the licensee. The NRC has included such change procedures in recently-issued plant
specific decommissioning orders.

The licensee has committed, prior to making any changes to its Decommissioning Plan, to apply the safety and environmental
review procedure specified below, which is similar to the safety review procedure specified in 10 CFR 50.59. This
commitment is consistent with the flexibility under  50.59 afforded to a licensee authorized to operate a facility
and other Decommissioning Orders issued by the NRC.

Section 50.59(a)(1) allows a holder of a license authorizing operation of a production or a utilization facility
to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Safety Analysis Report; and (ii) conduct tests
or experiments not described in the Safety Analysis Report, without NRC approval, provided the proposed action does
not consist of a change to the facility technical specifications or an unreviewed safety question.

I find that the licensee's commitments as set forth in its letters of August 2, and supplemented by letter dated August
5, 1994, are acceptable and conclude that with these commitments the safety of the plant is reasonably assured. In
view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health, safety, and interest require that the licensee's
commitments in its August 2, and August 5, 1994, letters be confirmed by this Order. The licensee has consented to the
issuance of this Order. (59 FR 46996, September 13, 1994)



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR part 50, It Is Hereby Ordered That The August 7, 1991, Decommissioning
Order Is Modified As Follows:

The Order of August 7, 1991, which directed the licensee to decommission the reactor facility in accordance with its
Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's regulations, is modified to include the following procedure by which
the licensee is allowed to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning Plan;
and (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval:






(a)(1) The licensee may (i) make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning Plan, and
(ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval, unless
the proposed change, test or experiment involves a change in technical specifications (TS) incorporated in the license,
an unreviewed safety question, or results in a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated in the
Environmental Assessment in support of the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning Order or the Final Environmental Statement
(FES) related to operation of LACBWR, dated April 21, 1980 (NUREG-0191). Notwithstanding the above, a reduction
in site staffing levels below the minimum number for any group or area shown on the organization chart (Fig. 6.1) in
the LACBWR Decommissioning Plan, or a change in the reporting relationships for the Plant Manager must be submitted
to the NRC as specified in 10 CFR 50.4, and receive NRC approval prior to implementation.

(2) A proposed change, test or experiment shall be deemed to involve an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment necessary for SAFSTOR previously evaluated
in either the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) or the Decommissioning Plan may be increased, or (ii) if a possibility
for an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the FSAR or Decommissioning Plan may
be created, or (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any TS is reduced.

(b)(1) The licensee shall maintain records of changes in the facility and of changes in procedures made pursuant to
this procedure, to the extent that these changes constitute changes in the facility or procedures as described in
either the FSAR or the Decommissioning Plan. The licensee shall also maintain records of tests and experiments performed
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. These records must include a written safety evaluation containing the
basis for the determination that the changes, tests or experiments do not involve an unreviewed safety question,
or a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated.

(2) The licensee shall annually submit, as specified in 10 CFR 50.4, a report containing a brief description of any
changes, tests, and experiments, including a summary of the safety evaluation of each.

(3) The licensee shall maintain records of changes in the facility until the date of termination of the license and
shall maintain the records of changes in procedures and records of tests and experiments for a period of three years.

(c) If the licensee desires (1) a change in the TS, or (2) to make a change in the facility or procedures described in the
Decommissioning Plan or conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, which involve an
unreviewed safety question, a change in the TS, or a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated,
the licensee shall submit an application for amendment of its license pursuant to 10 CFR 50.90.

<DOCTITLE>River Bend Station; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No
Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the River Bend Station,
located in West Feliciana Parish.


The proposed amendment would revise the formula for calculating the average power range monitor (APRM) flow biased
simulated thermal power-high reactor trip and flow biased neutron flux-upscale control rod block trip setpoints
T-factor specified in Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.2.2. The proposed changes are necessary to support implementation
of recommendations contained in NRC Generic Letter 94-02, ``Long-Term Solutions and Upgrade of Interim Operating
Recommendations for Thermal-Hydraulic Instabilities in Boiling Water Reactors.''


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.


The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), a licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:





1. The request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

This change only redefines the APRM setpoints T-factor. The modified APRM setpoints T-factor does not change or affect
operator required actions in relation to the APRM setpoints T-factor and is only applied at different power peaking
for given reactor power. Therefore, this change only affects the precursors to events that can be initiated as a result
of different power peaking. The only event affected is the formation of coupled thermal-hydraulic and neutronic
oscillations (reactor stability). Since the modified APRM setpoints T-factor allows power distributions which
permits the application of stability controls to increase stability margin, the probability for initiation of reactor
instability is significantly reduced. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
of any event previously evaluated. 

The consequence of a reactor instability event is minimized since the initial reactor conditions are associated
with very stable power distributions. These stable conditions are established using stability controls which are
permitted with the modified APRM setpoints T-factor. Since the initial reactor conditions are very stable, the severity
of a postulated reactor instability event is significantly diminished. In addition, the modified APRM setpoints
T-factor is confirmed to provide adequate LHGR [linear heat generation rate] protection at off-rated conditions
for other anticipated events. Protection of other thermal limits for all previously analyzed events is accomplished
by specific limits that are independent of the APRM setpoints T-factor. These are the power and flow dependent MCPR
[minimum critical power ratio] Operating Limits which provide protection from fuel dryout and the rated MAPLHGR
[maximum average planar linear heat-generation rate] limit which provides protection of the peak clad temperature
for the DBA [design-basis accident] LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident]. Therefore, the proposed changes does not
involve a significant increase in the consequences of any event previously evaluated.

The proposed change in APRM setpoints T-factor permits implementation of appropriate reactor stability controls
and maintains adequate off-rated LHGR margin for all operating conditions. This change, therefore, does not involve
a significant increase in the probability and consequences of any event previously evaluated.
2. The request does not create the possibility of occurrence of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
This change only redefines the APRM setpoints T-factor. The proposed changes do not involve any new modes of operation
or any plant modifications. The ability to implement reactor stability controls do not result in any new precursors
to an accident. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident
from any accident previously analyzed.
3. The request does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The change in the APRM setpoints T-factor definition allows the implementation of reactor stability controls during
reactor operation at off-rated conditions which significantly improve the reactor stability performance. This
is accomplished by achieving very stable power distributions outside the stability excluded region. Since the initial
reactor conditions are very stable, the severity of a postulated reactor instability event is significantly diminished.
The modified APRM setpoints T-factor accommodates higher power peaking to support the required stability controls.
The modified APRM setpoints T-factor has been confirmed to provide adequate LHGR protection. Operation with higher
peaking without APRM gains or flow bias trip setpoints adjustment does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety
because the higher power peaking resulting from the APRM setpoints T-factor modification are below applicable LHGR
limits. For power peaking conditions that result in APRM setpoints T-factor less than one, an adjustment to the APRM
gains or trip setpoints is made to provide additional LHGR protection. Additionally, an upper bound is placed on power
peaking by the modified APRM setpoints T-factor definition. Therefore, the modified APRM setpoint T-factor does
not involve a reduction in a margin of safety because the higher power peaking resulting from the APRM setpoints T-factor
modification is below applicable LHGR limits.
Protection of other thermal limits for all previously analyzed events is accomplished by specific limits that are
independent of the T-factor. These are the power and flow dependent MCPR Operating Limits which provide protection
from fuel dryout and the rated MAPLHGR limit which provides protection of the peak clad temperature for the DBA LOCA.
The proposed change does not result in an increase in core damage frequency. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety evaluated.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes the determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By October 21, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to the Pricing of Open Orders


September 15, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on August 16, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to amend Article III, Section 46 of the Rules of Fair Practice
 to clarify that its provisions will not apply if an issuer does not notify the NASD of the declaration of a dividend or
distributions. Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized; proposed deletions
are in brackets.






Adjustment of Open Orders
Sec. 46.


* * * * *


(e) The provisions of this rule shall not apply to [orders]: (1) 

orders

 governed by the rules of a registered national securities exchange; (2) 

orders

 marked ``do not reduce''; (3) 

orders

 marked ``do not increase;'' (4) open stop orders to buy; [or] (5) open sell orders[.1]

; or (6) orders for the purchase or sale of securities where the issuer of the securities has not reported a dividend,
payment or distribution pursuant to Rule 10b-17 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR  240.10b-17).




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item V below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Article III, Section 46 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, which is scheduled to go into effect on September 15, 1994,
requires members to adjust open orders for securities when they are quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution
or ex-interest.
 Most members are on notice that a particular security has gone ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest
because Rule 10b-17 under the Act
 generally requires an issuer to give notice to the Association
 no later than ten days prior to the record date involved
 of a dividend or other distribution in cash or in kind, a stock split or reverse split, or a rights or other subscription
offering. However, if an issuer does not comply with Rule 10b-17, the member holding an open order may not have
notice of the record date and permit the order to be executed when the security is quoted ex-dividend. Accordingly,
the NASD is proposing an amendment to Article III, Section 46 to provide that it will not apply where the issuer has not
provided the notice required by Rule 10b-17.







The NASD has not noted a widespread Rule 10b-17 compliance problem among domestic issuers. However, NASD member
firms that do a business in foreign securities are required by Article III, Section 46 to adjust the price of an open
order for a foreign security traded on a foreign exchange. In some cases, issuers of such securities are not required
by the laws of the issuers' country of domicile to announce a dividend, and often such issuers do not declare dividends
in advance. In some cases, the markets find out about dividends when there is a significant, unexplained price change
in the security and the issuer or exchange confirms, in response to inquiries, that a dividend has been declared. In
such a situation the firm may find itself in violation of Article III, Section 46 by permitting an open order to be executed
for such a security after the dividend has been declared.
In order to resolve the problem faced by member firms dealing in foreign securities or in securities of domestic issuers
who have not complied with Rule 10b-17, the NASD has determined that an exemption for open orders for such securities
from the coverage of the new section is necessary. Accordingly, the NASD is amending subsection (e) to Section 46 of
the NASD Rules of Fair Practice to state that the obligation to reprice open orders does not apply with respect to securities
where the issuer has not provided the required Rule 10b-17 notice. Because Rule 10b-17 requires issuers
to notify the NASD or national securities exchanges upon the declaration of a dividend or other distribution, using
Rule 10b-17 as the basis for the exemption means that the obligations of Article III, Section 46 of the Rules of
Fair Practice would attach only if an issuer has complied with Rule 10b-17.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
 which require that the rules of the association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, promote
just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest, in that the proposed rule preserves
the current obligation to adjust open orders after the ex-date without imposing an obligation on members that would
be difficult or impossible to meet if issuers did not announce dividends or distributions in advance of the ex-date.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The NASD has requested that the Commission find good cause pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) for approving the proposed
rule change prior to the 30th day after publication in the 

Federal Register

. The NASD notes that Section 46 is scheduled to go into effect on September 15, 1994; the Section requires members to
adjust open orders for securities when they are quoted ex-dividend, ex-rights, ex-distribution or ex-interest;
and that it is impracticable for members to fulfill the obligations imposed by the Section if an issuer has not complied
with the requirements of Rule 10b-17.
Based on the NASD's representations that: (1) the laws of the home jurisdiction(s) of many foreign issuers do not require
such issuers to announce the declaration of a dividend or distribution; (2) often such issuers do not declare dividends
in advance; (3) markets often find out about dividends only after there has been a significant, unexplained price
change in the security and the issuer or exchange confirms, in response to inquiries, that a dividend has been declared;
and (4) it is impracticable for members to fulfill the obligations imposed by the Section if an issuer, whether foreign
or domestic, has not complied with the requirements of Rule 10b-17, the Commission finds that the proposed rule
change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD
and, in particular, the requirements of Section 15A(b)(6). Section 15A(b)(6) requires, in part, that the rules of
the NASD be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public
interest.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposal on an accelerated basis to prevent NASD members from violating
the provisions of Section 46 in circumstances in which such members cannot be expected to be able to comply with that
Section. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change promotes the public interest by preserving a member's
obligation to adjust open orders after the ex-date without imposing an obligation that would be difficult or impossible
for that member to meet if an issuer does not announce dividends or distributions in advance of the ex-date. The Commission
finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of Section 15A and the rules and regulations thereunder.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20459. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to SR-NASD-94-46 and should be submitted by October 12,
1994.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-94-46),
be, and hereby is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Pilot Export Working Capital Program</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Pilot Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is issuing a notice to advise the public that it is beginning the Export Working
Capital Program (EWCP) on a pilot basis nationwide. The pilot program is scheduled to end September 30, 1995, at which
time it will be evaluated to determine what, if any, aspects of the pilot should be made permanent. This notice is issued
pursuant to  120.1-2 of SBA's regulations (13 CFR 120.1-2).


Under EWCP, SBA guarantees short-term working capital loans made by participating lenders to exporters for the purpose
of financing export transactions. EWCP is intended to replace SBA's Export Revolving Line of Credit (ERLC) Program.
Accordingly, the regulations for the ERLC Program (13 CFR 122.54) will not apply to EWCP loans.
The SBA and the Export Import Bank of the United States (ExIm Bank) are working to harmonize their export financing
programs. Accordingly, many features of SBA's EWCP and ExIm Bank's Export Working Capital Program are similar. By
design, SBA's Program will assist smaller businesses that need a guarantee of $750,000 or less and ExIm Bank's Program
will serve the larger businesses and small businesses that have larger credit needs.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 

EWCP loans are made under the authority of SBA's regular business loan program known as the 7(a) Program. The policies
and procedures governing the EWCP pilot are contained in operating guidelines developed for the Program. These guidelines
describe the eligibility, credit and processing considerations for the Program.


Eligibility Considerations


Under EWCP, SBA guarantees short-term working capital loans made by participating lenders to exporters. Loan proceeds
may only be used to finance the acquisition or production of goods and services being exported and accounts receivable
of such export sales under EWCP.
 A Pre-shipment Guarantee is used to finance the acquisition or production cost of export goods and services.
The term of these loans is usually no more than 12 months. Payment is secured by letter of credit, valid purchase orders
or contracts, or other such arrangement.
 A Post-shipment Guarantee is used to finance receivables resulting from export sales. The maximum term of
these loans should not exceed 6 months.
 A Combined Guarantee is used to finance both the acquisition or production of export goods and services and
the account receivables resulting from such export sales. The maximum term of a Combined Guarantee is 18 months.
Although payment may be made through one of several arrangements, usually ExIm bank insurance (or other comparable
insurance) will be required in conjunction with an EWCP Guarantee where Post-shipment or Combined guarantees are
being extended unless payment is being made by a confirmed, irrevocable letter of credit.
A loan Guarantee may be for a single transaction or for a Revolving Line of Credit which is used to finance ``bundles''
of individual transactions. Credit lines may be for as long as three years subject to annual renewals. Such renewals
will be granted unless an adverse change has occurred in the exporter's financial condition or operations sufficient
to jeopardize its ability to perform on export transactions. If a Line of Credit is terminated, no additional bundles
will be financed and a reasonable period will be provided to liquidate the outstanding balance on the Line of Credit.
Standby letters of Credit are issued by a bank to cover a particular contingency. Frequently, they are used in place
of a bid, performance or financial bonds. EWCP loans can be used to facilitate a Standby Letter of Credit.
Most products are eligible for EWCP financing. In some cases, however, Federal restrictions cause the product to
be ineligible. For example, if ExIm Bank export credit insurance is required, the product must contain at least 51%
U.S. content. Also, certain defense products are not eligible for ExIm Bank insurance. Where the product is customized
or designed for special use, care must be taken to assure that the exporter has sufficient capability of payment should
the transaction not be consummated.
Although service exports are eligible for EWCP financing, they entail greater risk than product exports, especially
those that are independent of product sales. EWCP financing of service exports usually will require progress payments
and possible additional collateral.
Applicants who produce, manufacture or sell products or provide services that enter into the export channel but do
not directly export their products or services, including suppliers to other domestic manufacturers, are eligible
for EWCP financing. In such cases, the applicant shall provide evidence to SBA that the goods or services are in fact
being exported.
The dollar amount of the SBA Guarantee is of an EWCP loan limited to the lesser of two factors. First, EWCP loans are limited
to the exporter's cost, if they are for Pre-shipment financing, or the receivable associated with the product being
exported, if they are for Post-shipment or Combined financing. Second, with few exceptions, the maximum guarantee
amount that may be outstanding or committed to any small business concern under the 7(a) and the 504 Programs in the
aggregate is $750,000. EWCP loans are considered 7(a) loans for this calculation.

As is the case for Regular 7(a) loans, EWCP loans of $155,000 or less will be eligible for an SBA Guarantee of 90 percent
of the principal amount of the loan. For loans over $155,000, the SBA Guarantee may not exceed 85 percent; however,
loans made under the SBA's Preferred Lender authority may not exceed 70%. It is noted that legislation is pending before
the Congress that would increase the maximum guarantee coverage for all EWCP loans to 90 percent. This legislative
change will cause the guarantee percentage to be the same as ExIm Bank's guarantee percentage.

SBA will monitor, but not regulate, the interest charges and fees imposed by lenders for EWCP loans. This approach
is consistent with the policies of ExIm Bank and most state export finance programs.

A $100 application fee will be assessed each applicant for an EWCP loan application or a Preliminary Commitment (PC)
application. However, an application fee will not be assessed to the lender on a loan application for an exporter who
had previously received a Preliminary Commitment and paid a fee. The normal guarantee fee for 7(a) loans will be assessed:
One quarter of one percent (.25%) for a loan under one year and two percent (2%) for loans over one year.

As previously stated, an SBA guaranteed EWCP loan is obtained by an exporter from a lender participating in SBA's EWCP
loan program. The exporter and the lender prepare the loan application which the lender submits to SBA for a loan guarantee.

In cases where an exporter is unable to find a lender willing to make the loan, the exporter can submit an application
to SBA for a Preliminary Commitment. A PC is a 60 day conditional commitment issued by SBA to an exporter specifying
that SBA will guaranty a loan to the exporter in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the PC. It should
be noted that PCs are not required as an interim step to obtaining an EWCP loan; rather, they help an exporter find a lender
who will make the loan. Another benefit of PCs is that they allow an exporter to take advantage of SBA financial counseling
and technical assistance without first having a participating lender.

In some areas, SBA approved Intermediaries will be available to assist exporters in loan packaging, deal structuring
and credit analysis. Pursuant to an agreement with the exporter, these intermediaries may charge an amount not to
exceed 1% of the loan amount. SBA approved resource partners will be available to assist exporters with management
and technical assistance.

Applicants must be identifiable small businesses organized in the United States as for profit entities with operations
in the United States. The size standards applicable to regular business loans under the 7(a) program also apply to
EWCP loans. While a business organized and/or located outside the United States is ineligible for EWCP financing,
a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign corporation may be eligible. Finally, Export Trading Companies and Export Management
Companies are eligible for EWCP financing if they take title to the goods being exported.

Applicants must have sufficient experience and capability to complete the export transaction. Generally, exporters
should have been in operations, though not necessarily in exporting, for at least 12 continuous months prior to filing
an application. Exceptions will be considered where the applicant is a new business but the principals have proven
expertise in the exporter's line of business.

The exporter's ability to perform is one of the most important considerations in the EWCP loan making process. This
includes the exporter's ability to acquire or produce the export product or service, complete the export transaction,
and present the proper documents for payment. Therefore, loan applications shall be approved only where such performance
capability is determined to exist.



Credit Considerations



All SBA guaranteed loans, including EWCP loans, are statutorily required to demonstrate reasonable assurance of
repayment. Usually, regular 7(a) loans are term loans and collateral is not linked to loan repayment. Assessment
of the applicant's ability to repay the loan from operations over an extended period is a primary concern and collateral
is important as a secondary source of repayment. Strength of the balance sheet including net worth and liquidity are
essential as well as the reasonableness of projections.



Conversely, 

EWCP loans are short-term and transaction-based. The primary repayment source is the collateral associated with
the transaction in which the lender has taken an assignment. The primary concern is the borrower's ability to perform
on the contract and the ability to realize on the collateral. The horizon is short on these transactions. Balance Sheet
strength, reasonableness of projections, etc. are important only as they relate to the primary concern.

SBA does not assess foreign commercial or political risk. Therefore, exporters are required to have an acceptable
letter of credit, valid purchase orders and contracts, acceptable export receivables and/or ExIm Bank export credit
insurance or private insurance that is acceptable. Transactions financed by EWCP loans must be payable in U.S. dollars
unless SBA permits otherwise on an exceptions basis. This policy addresses both the foreign currency and foreign
exchange risks.

It is essential that EWCP loans be secured with a first lien on all collateral associated with the transactions financed
by the loan. Also, an assignment of proceeds from the borrower to the lender shall be required as a condition to SBA's
guarantee. SBA has modified its policy on personal guarantees due to the short-term nature of these loans and their
structure.

Subject to appropriate approvals, SBA and ExIm Bank plan to utilize, under the pilot, a joint loan application form.
This will enable potential borrowers to better understand the program functions and uses. Also, it will facilitate
the referral of applications to the appropriate Agency. Other SBA forms required by law or policy will be used by SBA
during the pilot.

Processing Considerations



EWCP loan applications are processed on a three track system. Track one is regular processing and all participating
lenders in EWCP have the authority to submit EWCP loan applications on this track. Track two is the Certified Lenders
Program (CLP) where greater reliance is placed on the lender's analysis and three day turnaround is the standard.
Track three is the Preferred Lenders Program (PLP) where lenders are given delegated authority to make loans.

In addition to regular processing, EWCP participating lenders that meet the eligibility criteria for CLP and/or
PLP will have the authority to submit loans for processing on track two and/or three as the case may be. It should be noted
that all EWCP participating lenders must have successful experience in providing trade finance to exporters and
an acceptable collateral management system. Also, it is noted that all applications for Preliminary Commitments
will be processed on track one, regular processing.

SBA District Offices that have affiliated U.S. Export Assistance Centers will be processing centers for EWCP loan
and Preliminary Commitment applications. Other District Offices may be designated as EWCP processing centers based
on activity and capability. District Offices that are not so designated will forward loan applications for processing
to the designated EWCP processing center. All SBA district offices, whether or not designated as processing centers,
will promote the pilot program and will continue to offer business development assistance to exporters. During the
term of the pilot, the SBA Office of International Trade will work closely with the SBA processing offices to provide
technical support on loan structuring and foreign risk assessment.

Because EWCP loans are short-term and often require swift action by staff familiar with the loan, the SBA recommending
loan officer will retain the responsibility for loan servicing. If the lender does not handle the loan liquidation,
the SBA district office which approved the loan will liquidate it.

During the pilot, EWCP loans will not be eligible for sale in the secondary market that exists for 7(a) loans.

In summary, SBA's Export Working Capital Program is a loan guarantee program for exporters to provide transaction
financing. There are three important considerations in this program: (1) The existence of a transaction(s), (2)
the capability of the exporter to perform and satisfy the requirements of the transaction(s), and (3) loan repayment
(adequacy of documents, security interest in the collateral and assignment of proceeds).

Recurrent and Transition Training



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice requests public comment to identify acceptable industry standards for transition and recurrent flight
training for civil aviation pilots other than those engaged in commercial air transportation. This notice asks each
commenter to provide subjects and standards for transition and recurrent flight training that may be incorporated
into one or more new or revised Advisory Circulars (AC). This information will help the FAA develop effective advisory
material in partnership with the aviation community.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

With this notice the FAA is announcing an evaluation of transition and recurrent flight training for civil aviation
pilots other than those engaged in commercial air transportation. One of the goals of the 1994 General Aviation Action
Plan (GAAP) calls for increasing the effectiveness of the pilot and aircraft maintenance technician training infrastructure
(flight instructors, schools, practical test standards, knowledge testing publications), and transition training
and recurrent training programs. Additionally, the GAAP states that FAA efforts will include programs to solicit
customer (the aviation community) feedback and other input on our services. Consequently, the FAA is requesting
information on industry standards for transition and recurrent flight training.



Currently, there are several ACs that address various transition and recurrent flight training subject areas. Some
of these are: AC 61-9B, 

Pilot Transition Courses for Complex Single Engine and Light Twin-Engine Airplanes; 

AC 61-10A, 

Private and Commercial Pilot Refresher Courses; 

AC 61-66 

Annual Pilot in Command Proficiency Checks; 

AC 61-89A, 

Pilot Certificates: Aircraft Type Ratings; 

AC 61-98A, 

Currency and Additional Qualification Requirements for Certificated Pilots; 

AC 61-103, 

Announcement of Availability: Industry-Developed Transition Training Guidelines for High Performance Aircraft;
and 

AC 61-107, 

Operations of Aircraft at Altitudes Above 25,000 Feet MSL and/or MACH numbers (Mmo) Greater Than .75. 

The FAA is considering combining these ACs into one or two ACs.

Often a pilot will transition from basic training aircraft to faster and more complicated aircraft. The FAA is seeking
information on whether a pilot should receive transition training with some or all of these changes of aircraft and,
if so, what training. Especially with the development and certification of pressurized single engine and light twin
engine aircraft with complex systems not requiring a type rating, transition training has become more critical.
The FAA believes that it should publish information on the recommended training to transition from aircraft to aircraft.

The FAA recognizes that many civil aviation pilots desire, and may obtain, an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate,
although that certificate is not required for civil aviation operations which are not air carrier operations. The
FAA believes that many corporate flight departments, for their own reasons, require their pilots to hold an ATP certificate.
Insurance company requirements may influence pilots to gain an ATP certificate even though it is not required for
the operations performed by those pilots. Commenters should feel free to address transition and recurrent flight
training subjects that they believe to be applicable to the ATP certificate as well as the recreational, private,
and commercial certificates.

Additionally, the FAA believes that appropriate recurrent training can be very effective in reducing accidents
and incidents. Regression analysis of the general aviation fatal accident rate data indicates that following the
implementation of the biennial flight review requirement (November 1, 1974) there was a one-time 10 percent decrease
in fatal accident rates beyond the existing long-term declining trend in accident rates. The FAA also believes that
the more appropriate the recurrent flight training, the greater the reduction in accidents. Consequently, the FAA
is requesting that the public identify subjects and standards for transition and recurrent flight training, if the
current ACs should be modified and if so, how they should be modified, and the content of the ACs.

The FAA is especially seeking comments from flight instructors, manufacturers, industry groups, aircraft specific
type clubs and societies, and insurance underwriters.

<DOCTITLE>Recordation: Treatment of Instruments With Proprietary Information Intentionally Omitted; Legal Opinion</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of legal opinion.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice of legal opinion is issued by the FAA Chief Counsel to advise interested parties of the treatment of instruments,
including leases, with certain proprietary information intentionally omitted, when they are submitted to the Civil
Aviation Registry for recordation as conveyances.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 503(a)(1) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1403(a)(1)) requires the Secretary of Transportation
to establish and maintain a system for the recording of conveyances which affect title to, or any interest in, civil
aircraft of the United States.




Under section 101(20) of the Federal Aviation Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1301(20)), a ``conveyance'' means a bill of sale,
contract of conditional sale, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, or other instrument affecting title to, or interest
in, property. Consistent with that definition, aircraft leases are treated as conveyances.

Leases and other conveyances are frequently submitted for recordation to the Civil Aviation Registry (the Registry).
Prior to submitting documents to the Registry, law firms will often request the opinion of the FAA Assistant Chief
Counsel for the Aeronautical Center with respect to questions concerning registration or recordation. In the last
several years, when submitting such documents, law firms have typically asked the Assistant Chief Counsel a question
similar to this:





We hereby request your opinion that the Lease Amendment, with (i) Exhibit B (Table of Stipulated Loss Values), (ii)
Exhibit C (Table of Basic Rents) and (iii) Exhibit D (End of Term Buyout Percentage) intentionally omitted from the
FAA filing counterpart thereof as containing confidential information, is eligible for recordation under section
503(a) of the Act.





The Assistant Chief Counsel typically responds by permitting recordation with such omissions. Airlines and other
parties that record conveyances involving large aircraft strongly favor continuation of such permission.

Now, the editor of the ``Commercial Aviation Report'' and persons who appraise the market value of large aircraft
oppose continuation of such recordations and request that the Registry record only complete documents. Their position
is set out in the Locke Parnell Rain Harrell (hereinafter, Locke Parnell) law firm's letter of September 1, 1993.

Following receipt of the Locke Parnell letter, the views of interested persons were solicited. This option addresses
the concerns of all interested parties and states the agency position with respect to the recordability of conveyances
with redactions and omissions.

Accordingly, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(D), the FAA publishes its response to Locke Parnell in the Appendix
to this document.

Treatment of Instruments With Proprietary Information Intentionally Omitted



Dear Mr. Packard: Thank you for your letter of September 1, 1993, in which, on behalf of your client, ``Commercial Aviation
Report,'' you object to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permitting air carriers and lessors to submit
purchase, sale, and lease documents to FAA for recordation with certain financial information deleted.

You say that the omitted information includes lease rates, maintenance reserves, amortization schedules and debt
loans. You argue that FAA's permitting the nondisclosure of such information is contrary to the public interest because
the deleted information is essential in making fair and accurate assessments of a carrier's financial status, its
safety and maintenance reserves and meaningful debt analysis.

You request FAA to immediately stop its policy of permitting recordation of incomplete document, or, in the alternative,
to initiate formal rulemaking procedures allowing for public comment.

As your know, your letter was distributed as an attachment to FAA's letter of September 27, 1993, which requested advice
from interested persons concerning the legal and policy issues. We received responses from 17 concerned parties
including attorneys, airlines, appraisers, the Air Transport Association, and the editor of ``Commercial Aviation
Report.'' Twelve responses favored continuation of the FAA policy of permitting omissions. Five responses opposed
it. Their positions will be discussed herein.

Based on review of the comments and our reconsideration of the issues, we have decided to continue permitting the recordation
of documents with limited omissions or redactions.

As set out in your letter of September 1, 1993, and letters from Rocklin D. Lyons and Associates; Jack B. Feir and Associates;
Aircraft Information Services, Inc.; Avitas Aviation; and ``Commercial Aviation Report,'' principal arguments
in support of FAA acceptance of only complete instruments are the following:

It is urged that obtaining capital to finance transactions involving transport aircraft is highly competitive.
In making decisions, lenders rely heavily on information concerning financial health of an airline, as well as the
real market value of aircraft. The market value is frequently determined by appraisals which are based on recent comparable
transactions. A principal source of information about comparables is found in the Registry's aircraft records.
If financial and other information considered proprietary is permitted to be deleted, market value appraisals become
more speculative. As a result, conservative investors are less likely to back transactions where the real value of
the collateral is not reliable. It is urged that will hurt the aviation industry.,

Additionally, it is urged that the overall financial situation of an airline is often discernible from a review of
recorded transactions. As an example, one commenter pointed out that although a particular airline, as a public company,
had filed all documents required by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Transportation
(DOT), it was only through a thorough review of the Registry's aircraft record that the ``true extent of its financial
woes'' became known. The resulting publication of the ``carrier's precarious condition'' allegedly resulted in
financial institutions withdrawing from transactions with the airline.

The same commenter pointed out that SEC and DOT do not provide current information and retain such information only
for a limited time.

With respect to legality, an attorney suggests that a document with schedules deleted is not a ``conveyance'' because
in defining a contract, Black's Law Dictionary says: the writing * * * contains the agreement of the
parties with the terms and conditions* * *.

He argues that:

<PARENT> FR940921-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A written instrument that contains less than the total of the terms cannot, by definition, be ``the'' conveyance.

He further points out that the filing system under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the various states, is
totally dissimilar from the filing system under section 503 of the Federal Aviation Act.

He also says that the leading court cases which discuss the purposes of the Federal aircraft recording system do not
factually involve the issue of whether proprietary information may be omitted.

The case for permitting documents to be recorded with deletions is set out in letters from Pegasus Capital Corporation;
Crowe and Dunlevy; American Airlines; USAir; AINA Holdings, Inc.; British Aerospace, Inc.; Milbank, Tweed, Hadley
and McCloy; United Airlines; Paul, Hastings, Janofsky, and Walker; Federal Express; Air Transport Association;
and McAfee and Taft.

In regard to policy issues, practically all persons supporting FAA's recording documents with omissions or redactions
have mentioned the significant harm which would befall airlines if confidential financial information were required
to be released. They assert that the harm comes not only as a result of the advantage to other airlines in knowing proprietary
information about the competition, but also in the weakened negotiating position of airlines if lenders are aware
of financial concessions in previous agreements. Moreover, it is urged that foreign airlines and nonaviation businesses
would have a distinct advantage in competing for capital.

Several airlines point out that there is a significant amount of information concerning airline fitness already
available to the public. In any event, they say that the Registry was never intended as a database for financial information
which even airlines' stockholders can't obtain. 

Several commenters suggest that full disclosure does not benefit the public at large but only parochial interests.

With respect to legal issues, practically all pro-omission commenters point out that there is no statutory or regulatory
basis to require disclosure of confidential financial information. By reference to legislative history, case law,
and ``plain meaning'' of section 503 of the Federal Aviation Act, they point out that the Registry was established
as a clearing house solely to allow interested persons to check on interests in aircraft.

An attorney in Oklahoma City argues that FAA's position with respect to permitting omissions has not really changed
since 1938. He alleges that neither FAA nor its predecessor, Civil Aeronautics Authority, ever required a promissory
note with underlying financial information be filed with a chattel mortgage. He also alleges that the Registry has
historically accepted security agreements which contain blanks representing financial terms.

Several commenters analogize the FAA recording system to that established in each of the states based on the Uniform
Commercial Code's model. One airline suggests that the FAA recording system would pass legal muster even if it were
only a ``notice system.'' A law firm says a ``bare-bones conveyance'' is recordable with ``superfluous information
in an unrecorded document.''

Four commenters have pointed out that since 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) exempts release of commercial or financial information
under the Freedom of Information Act, the Registry should not disclose such information. An airline says that under
section 1104 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1505), disclosure of information obtained by FAA is
not permitted if such disclosure would ``adversely affect the competitive position of any carrier in foreign air
transportation.''

Two law firms say that FAA should not be in the business of determining the validity of instruments since that is reserved
to the states under section 506 of the Act.

An Oklahoma City attorney says that Congress' intent in creating the FAA recording system can be gleaned from section
503(g) of the Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1503(g)) which authorizes FAA to issue regulations providing for endorsements upon
certificates of registrations ``as may be necessary to facilitate the determination of the rights of parties dealing
with civil aircraft * * *.''

The same attorney suggests that a recordable ``conveyance'' is simply whatever the Registry will accept under  49.33(a)
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 49.33(a)).

In answer to Locke Parnell's assertion that permitting documents to be recorded with omissions requires rulemaking
action by FAA, a commenter says that the ``policy'' or ``rule'' which permits omissions is exempted from rulemaking
by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) because it is an interpretative rule.

All comments have been reviewed. We now begin discussion by considering the statutory language.

In pertinent part, section 503(a)(1) of the Act (49 App. U.S.C. 2403(a)(1)) provides:

The Secretary of Transportation shall establish and maintain a system for the recording of * * * any
conveyance which affects the title to, or any interest in, any civil aircraft of the United States.

Under section 101(20) of the Act (49 App. U.S.C. 1301(20)), a ``conveyance'' means:

A bill of sale, contract of conditional sale, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, or other instrument affecting title
to, or interest in, property.

(The Registry has historically treated aircraft leases as instruments affecting an interest in property.)




There is nothing in the language of section 503 of the Act, or by way of legislative history to the Act of 1958 and predecessor
Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, to suggest that section 503 of the Act mandates disclosure of confidential financial
information. The purpose of section 503 of the Act is ``* * * to create a central clearing house for recordation
of title so that a person, wherever he may be, will know where he can find ready access to the claims against, or liens,
or other legal interests in an aircraft.'' 

Aircraft Trading And Services

 v. 

Braniff, Inc.

 819 F.2d 1227 at 1231 (2nd Cir. 1987), quoting language in 

Philko Aviation, Inc. 

v. 

Shacket,

 462 U.S. 406 at 411 (1983), which language comes from house hearings leading to passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act
of 1938.

To our knowledge, there is no case law that indicates that section 503 of the Act either requires disclosure of financial
information or that a legislative purpose of section 503 of the Act was to provide information concerning financial
fitness or safety of airlines.

In the FAA Assistant Chief Counsel's letter of September 27, 1993, he posed the question whether a document with schedules
omitted is a ``conveyance.'' That question is relevant because under section 503 of the Act, FAA records only ``conveyances''
as defined in section 101(20) of the Act.

Only a few commenters responded to the question. As previously noted, one attorney argued that a document which is
anything less than the complete agreement of the parties is not a conveyance.

However, other commenters say that such a document may be a conveyance:

1. * * * so long as the provisions relating to the conveyance of title or interest are not redacted * * *.

2. Because a conveyance is similar to an enforceable sale of goods under UCC 2-201 which requires only a writing
sufficient to show a contract of sale.

3. Because a ``bare-bones conveyance'' is sufficient.
4. Because such a conveyance is considered ``acceptable by the Administrator.''

We believe that such a document with certain, limited omissions or redactions is a conveyance. It would be difficult
to explain why a 30-page, original lease signed by the parties is not a conveyance simply because a schedule showing
stipulated loss values has been intentionally omitted. The fact that the parties to such a lease may also have reached
agreement as to stipulated loss value (which they are unwilling to disclose) does not, in our judgment, make the lease
submitted for recordation any less a conveyance.

The regulations which implement section 503 of the Act are set out in part 49 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14
CFR part 49);  49.1 is a restatement of section 503 of the Act. Section 49.31 is a restatement of the definition
of ``conveyance'' in section 101(20) of the Act and includes release, cancellation, and discharges as authorized
in section 503(b) of the Act.

Section 49.33 states the eligibility requirements of recording conveyances. As pertinent to this discussion,  49.33(a)
provides that a conveyance must be ``in a form prescribed by, or acceptable to, the Administrator for that kind of conveyance.''

Determinations of what are ``* * *acceptable to, the Administrator.'' can be found in the Registry's
Examination Guidelines, and in opinions of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center. There are no
FAA guidelines which presently speak to the issue of recordability with omissions and redactions.

During the last 5 years law firms have routinely sought favorable opinions concerning the redaction of schedules
containing confidential financial information. The Assistant Chief Counsel frequently finds such redactions
acceptable.

Therefore, it appears, as one of the commenters has suggested, that certain redacted conveyances when submitted
for recordation are in a form which has been found and continues to be found acceptable.

Section 49.33(c) provides that a conveyance must be an original or duplicate original document. As discussed earlier,
there is no indication that a Congressional purpose would be defeated by allowing the withholding of certain financial
information. Nor for that matter, does  49.33(c) require that an original document or duplicate original document
contain such information when no Congressional purpose would be served. Therefore, we regard an allowably redacted
conveyance with ink signatures to meet the requirement for an ``original or duplicate original document.''

Based on the foregoing discussion, we believe that the recording of documents with limited redactions or omissions
is not contrary to statute, regulation, or other directive.

We next turn to Locke Parnell's claim that rulemaking action is necessary in order to continue the practice of recording
documents with omissions or redactions. Such action would include general notice of proposed rulemaking and the
public's opportunity to participate in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (c).

The Air Transport Association (ATA) has commented that: FAA has informally construed the Part 49 regulations to allow
conveyance transactions to be recorded without certain sensitive information * * *.
ATA suggests that what FAA is doing is in the nature of interpreting section 503(a) of the Act and that ``interpretative
rules'' are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) from formal rulemaking requirements. (``General statements of policy''
are also exempt under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).)
Federal courts have applied various tests, singly or in combination, to attempt to distinguish between interpretative
and legislative rules (e.g., ``substantial impact;'' ``deference to agency label;'' ``legal effect;'' ``binding
norm''). See Administrative Conference of the United States, A Guide To Federal Agency Rulemaking, 55-68 (2d
ed. 1991), pages 55 through 68. More recently, in determining whether rules are either legislative or interpretative,
courts have focused on the legal effect of the rules. See 

e.g., American Min. Congress 

v. 

MSHA, 

995 F.2d 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1993). ``A statute or legislative rule that actually establishes a duty or right is likely
to be relatively specific (and the agency's refinement will be interpretative), whereas an agency's authority to
create rights and duties will typically be relatively broad (and the agency's actual establishment of rights and
duties will become an amendment merely because it supplies crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being
interpreted). If that were so, no rule could pass as an interpretation of a legislative rule unless it were confined
to parroting the rule or replacing the original vagueness with another.'' 

Id. 

at 1112. Consequently, the FAA's delineation of section 503(a) as permitting the continued recordation of conveyances
with omissions or redactions of financial data is interpretative and not legislative in nature.
Finally, we note that a commenter suggests that the FAA should adopt a UCC-like approach and only require that a filed
document indicate that a party has conveyed title to or has an interest in a civil aircraft. By this opinion, we intend
only to affirm the continuation of permitting schedules containing confidential, proprietary information to be
redacted or omitted from otherwise recordable documents. With respect to particular documents, the advice of the
Assistant Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center should be sought.

Availability of Documentation From the National Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) Architecture Development
Program; Request for Participation in Public Forums 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Transportation is making publicly available the documentation from the first phase of the National
IVHS Architecture Development Program. An independent Phase I Summary Report will be made publicly available as
well. Comments on these materials are requested from all who choose to review them. This notice also announces a series
of regional forums to present these first phase results. The comments received through this announcement and at the
forums will influence upcoming program decisions that shape the National IVHS Architecture in the second and final
phase of the program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The goal of the National IVHS Architecture Development Program is to document, by the summer of 1996, a nationwide
framework for implementation of IVHS. The architecture will help achieve national compatibility of IVHS technologies
and systems while allowing for regional flexibility in building actual systems. This national architecture will
also integrate the broad range of services available to users of IVHS to achieve efficiencies in the use of communications
and infrastructure resources, while maintaining enough openness in the system to foster a rich market for products
and services that allows for innovation, expansion, and modernization over time. 



Teams headed by Hughes Aircraft Company, Loral Federal Systems Group, Rockwell, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation
were selected in September 1993 to independently develop four alternative system concepts, or ``architectures,''
for a nationwide IVHS. The program is proceeding in two phases. Phase I, which will conclude in December 1994, has involved
the definition and preliminary analysis of alternative concepts. It is the documentation products of this effort
that are being made available through this announcement. The most promising concepts will be continued into an 18-month
Phase II, which will focus on detailed analysis of these concepts and resolution of differences such that a single
consensus architecture is produced and documented. 

A complete set of 12 documents from each of the four study teams participating in this first phase of the architecture
development will be made publicly available in mid-October 1994. A Phase I Summary Report containing educational
background material, overviews of the four architectures, and additional detail on the implications of each approach
will also be made available shortly thereafter.
