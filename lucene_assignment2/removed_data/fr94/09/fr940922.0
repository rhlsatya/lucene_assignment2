Milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Marketing Area; Revision of Cooperative Association Reserve Processing
Plant Shipping Requirement 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document reinstates the cooperative pool reserve processing plant delivery requirement of 35 percent under
the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Federal milk order (Order 36), as of January 1, 1996. A reduction from 35 to
25 percent was intended to be temporary for the period July 1, 1993, through August 31, 1994. The current issue of the
Code of Federal Regulations shows the percentage requirement to be 25 percent. The percentage of a cooperative association's
member milk that must be delivered to pool distributing plants to qualify the cooperative's reserve processing plant
for pooling continues to be 25 percent until December 31, 1995, rather than 35 percent. This action is necessary to
prevent uneconomic movements of milk for the purpose of pooling much of the market's supply.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior documents in this proceeding: 


Revision of Rule: Issued July 22, 1993; published July 30, 1993 (58 FR 40724). 
Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued June 27, 1994; published July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33922). 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 
This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of  1036.7(f) of the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order. 
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 33922) concerning a proposed relaxation of the cooperative association reserve processing plant shipping
requirement. The revision was proposed to be effective for the months of September 1994 through December 1995. The
public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments
by August 1, 1994. Three comments supporting the proposed revision were received. No opposing comments were received.



Statement of Consideration 


This rule continues to ease the pooling requirements for cooperative reserve processing plants by 10 percentage
points, to 25 percent, for the period September 1, 1994, through December 31, 1995. Under the revision the total minimum
quantity of a cooperative association's milk supply that is required to be delivered to distributing plants in order
for the cooperative's reserve supply plant to maintain pool status is reduced from 35 percent to 25 percent. 
In order for a cooperative association plant that does not qualify as a pool distributing or pool supply plant to be
a pool plant, the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order requires that the cooperative must deliver to pool distributing
plants a minimum of 35 percent of the total quantity of milk marketed by the cooperative, either during the month or
during the 12-month period ending with the immediately preceding month. 
The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase
or decrease the required shipping percentages for cooperative reserve supply plants by up to 10 percentage points
if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments.

The revision was requested originally for the period July 1993 through August 1994 by Milk Marketing, Inc. (MMI),
a cooperative association that represents many of the market's producers. As printed in the 

Federal Register

, the revision became effective July 1, 1993, with no termination date. The 1994 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
reflects the revised shipping standards, and without further amendatory action, the 1995 CFR will also reflect the
reduced 25-percent shipping standard. 

MMI requested continued revision of the cooperative association shipping requirements for the period September
1, 1994, through December 31, 1995, and a proposed revision was issued. Comments supporting the revision were received
from MMI and two other cooperative associations with members whose milk is pooled under Order 36. MMI, Eastern Milk
Producers Cooperative Association, Inc. (Eastern), and Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. (Dairylea), stated that the
revision is needed to prevent unnecessary and uneconomic movements of milk because of the current severe milk supply-demand
imbalance in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area. 

MMI's comments included a description of milk marketing conditions for June 1994 that show milk production for the
market increased over 4 percent from the same month of the previous year, representing 12 million additional pounds
of milk in the Order 36 pool. For the same month, Class I sales decreased by nearly 2.5 percent from June 1993, representing
a reduction of approximately 3.4 million pounds of Class I sales. As a result of the market's increasing production
and declining Class I use, nearly 15.5 million pounds of milk had to be used in manufactured products than in the same
month the previous year. 

The comments filed by Eastern stated that the trends observable for June are expected to continue for the foreseeable
future, creating additional pooling difficulties for cooperative handlers pooling milk under Order 36. Dairylea
stated that continuation of the revision would prevent unnecessary, uneconomic movements of milk. 

According to comments filed, milk supplies historically pooled under the order currently are continuing to lose
their markets and having to find new outlets for their production. Apparently, Order 36 and nearby pool distributing
and pool supply plants are releasing some of their milk suppliers to find their own markets for milk. Such institutional
changes in the sources of supply for various plants may result in market instability and disorder. 

Milk production in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area appears to be increasing while Class I use
is declining. As a result, greater volumes of milk must be diverted to manufacturing uses than in prior years. The last
full year before the 1990 proceeding that resulted in the amendments that took effect October 1, 1993, was 1989. During
the short production months (September through November) of 1989, the percentage of Order 36 producer milk needed
for Class I use was over 60 percent, with less than 30 percent of the market's milk used in Class III. For the same period
of 1992, the percentage of producer milk used in Class I was just 55 percent, with the Class III percentage increasing
to nearly 36 percent. The trend continued during the same months of 1993, with less than 55 percent of the producer milk
pooled during September, October and November used in Class I. 

The increased production and decline in Class I sales, coupled with the market's changing handler-producer relationships,
necessitates a continuation in the reduction of the percentage of milk that must be delivered by a cooperative association
to pool distributing plants in order to assure the pool status of the cooperative's member milk. 

The revision effective July 1, 1993, should continue in effect for a period long enough to allow the institutional
shifts currently in process to work themselves out, and for the cooperative associations to assure themselves of
an adequate fluid market for their producer milk. Therefore, the revision should remain in place through December
1995. 

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth, and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that the diversion limitation percentage set forth in  1036.7(d) should be
maintained at the present 25-percent level through December 31, 1995.

Small Business Investment Companies; Leverage



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule allows Small Business Investment Companies licensed under sections 301 (c) and (d) of the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958 (Licensees) having no immediate need for SBA financial assistance (Leverage) to reserve the
future availability of such financial assistance by obtaining SBA's conditional commitment to guarantee Debentures
or Participating Securities (collectively ``pooled securities''), or to purchase Preferred Securities, that
will be offered in the future as the Licensee draws against SBA's commitment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 8, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule which contemplated allowing Licensees to apply for a conditional
commitment from SBA to reserve Leverage for their future use. See 59 FR 40315. The amount of Leverage that could be reserved
by any Licensee was proposed to be not less than $1,000,000, and not more than 50 percent of the Licensee's Regulatory
Capital.



The public was afforded a 30-day period in which to submit comments on the proposed rule. SBA received six comment letters
during that time, all of which strongly supported the underlying concept of an Agency commitment of future financial
assistance to Licensees but which also made several suggestions for improving the proposal.

One recurring suggestion was that SBA eliminate the restriction on the amount that could be reserved on behalf of any
one Licensee. As stated above, the proposed rule would have established a commitment ceiling equal to 50% of a Licensee's
Regulatory Capital. Although SBA's rationale for the ceiling was not discussed in the proposed rule, most of the commenters
understood that the ceiling was proposed in an attempt to fairly distribute scarce resources and to prevent the hoarding
of committed funds by any one Licensee.

SBA did realize, as the comment letters pointed out, that even if there were no ceiling in the regulations, the Agency
would still have the authority to allocate commitment authority among interested Licensees. Nevertheless, SBA
believed that given: (i) A probable timetable for the funding of an average Licensee's investors' commitments of
25% a year for 4 years (thereby converting the Licensee's Regulatory Capital into Leverageable Capital) and (ii)
an ideal Leverage ratio during those 4 years of 2:1, the average Licensee's need for committed Leverage funds would
be adequately met by an annual limit of 50% of Regulatory Capital.

SBA has reconsidered its position and has concluded that the regulation should be broad enough to accommodate, without
resort to an Agency waiver, those Licensees with investor-funding schedules that are more compressed than the average.
SBA still believes that some ceiling is desirable administratively, but a ceiling set at 50% of Regulatory Capital
may be too low, particularly in years when demand for reserved funds does not exceed the supply. Accordingly, in this
final rule, SBA has increased the ceiling to 100% of Regulatory Capital.

A second suggestion submitted during the comment period addressed the documentation proposed to be required pre-
and post-funding of draws under SBA's commitment. Under the proposed rule, every Licensee with an outstanding commitment
from SBA would be required to submit a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) within 30 days of the close of
each of its fiscal quarters. A Licensee submitting a draw request within that 30-day period would be required to submit
the Short Form Financial Statement, or a statement of no adverse change since its most recent Short Form 468, with the
draw request.

A few of the comment letters objected to quarterly financial reporting as burdensome and unnecessary. SBA disagrees.
The preparation of a quarterly short form financial statement becomes a simple matter if performed on a personal computer,
using readily-available bookkeeping software together with reporting software provided by SBA.

Furthermore, the commitment funding process as proposed by SBA was not intended to put SBA at a disadvantage relative
to where it would have been if it were considering a request for Leverage under the traditional funding mechanism.
Since Leverage requests outside of the commitment process must be accompanied by a Short Form 468 for the most recent
fiscal quarter, and since the draw down of funds under the SBA commitment is the issuance of Leverage, SBA should receive
a Short Form 468 for the most recent quarter in order to evaluate a draw request.
Under the commitment funding process, decisions on requests for draws will have to be made quickly by SBA staff, more
quickly than decisions on requests for Leverage under the traditional funding process. SBA staff will need to monitor
more closely the financial status of a Licensee with an outstanding SBA commitment in order to be able to respond in
a timely fashion to the Licensee's draw requests. The filing of quarterly financial statements on Short Form 468 by
all Licensees with outstanding SBA commitments will allow SBA to perform that function as promised.
As mentioned above, in the event the draw request is made within 30 days of the end of the Licensee's fiscal quarter,
SBA had proposed to accept a statement of no adverse change in lieu of the Short Form 468. Most of the comment letters
argued in favor of adopting the more familiar standard of ``no material adverse change''. SBA agrees that adverse
changes which are immaterial to the Licensee's financial status should not be a barrier to consideration for a draw
of Leverage. Accordingly,  107.215(f)(3)(i)(A) has been finalized with the suggested change.
Most of the comment letters also contained an objection to the requirement for specific deal information both pre-
and post-draw. SBA reaffirms its position that while a Licensee need not have specific transactions under consideration
in order to obtain SBA's commitment, draws under that commitment must be intended for use in a particular transaction
with a particular small concern.
To ease the paperwork burden on Licensees, however, the statement evidencing the Licensee's need for the funds no
longer requires that the Licensee provide the small concern's Standard Industrial Classification code number or
a summary of the proposed financing. See proposed  107.215(f)(2)(i)(B), finalized as  107.215(f)(3)(i)(B).
Instead, the statement must include only the name and address of the small concern, the amount of the proposed financing,
and the scheduled closing date.
SBA is also extending by 30 days the due date for the written explanation of the failure to close a transaction. In summary,
if the intended transaction closes, the Licensee must submit a Form 1031 (``Portfolio Financing Report'') within
30 days of the actual closing date. If the transaction fails to close, however, a written explanation must be filed
with SBA within 60 days (instead of 30 days, as proposed) after the scheduled closing date. Penalties for the failure
to file the Form 1031 or the written explanation remain unchanged from the proposed rule.
The final documentation matter addressed in some of the comment letters concerns the requirement that a Licensee
submit a certified statement with each draw request representing that it is in compliance with applicable regulations.
The suggestion was made that SBA be permitted to accept draw requests in the event violations are disputed or are not
material in nature. SBA has considered the suggestion and believes a clarification of the subject matter is in order.
SBA did not intend to apply a different standard to draw requests than it currently applies to Leverage requests. A
Licensee with an unresolved regulatory violation that would not be cause for automatic disqualification for Leverage
under the traditional funding process should not, for the same violation, be disqualified automatically from drawing
down Leverage under the commitment funding process.
In practice, there are two separate circumstances under the traditional funding process where SBA would consider
favorably the Leverage request of a Licensee with an outstanding violation: (1) If the Licensee's violation is of
a non-substantive provision of the Act or regulations and the Licensee has not repeatedly violated non-substantive
provisions; or (2) if the Licensee has agreed with SBA on a course of action for the resolution of its violation, and
if the terms of the agreement do not preclude the Licensee from obtaining Leverage prior to the resolution of the violation.
In each case, the determination as to whether a violation exists is made by SBA, as is the decision to provide Leverage
notwithstanding the violation.
SBA has revised the proposed rule to allow for favorable consideration of a draw request under those two circumstances.
See new paragraph 107.215(f)(2) ``Conditions to draws.'' Proposed  107.215(f)(2) has been renumbered as
 107.215(f)(3), and now permits a Licensee to submit a certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
it is in compliance with applicable regulations (i.e., it has no unresolved regulatory violations) or an explanation
as to the specific nature of any outstanding violations.
One additional change has been made to the proposed rule. The amount of the commitment fee was not set forth in the proposal.
This final rule fixes -he commitment fee at 3% of the face amount of the pooled securities and 1% of the issue price of
the Preferred Securities reserved under the commitment. As explained below, when pooled securities are issued by
a Licensee as a draw against SBA's commitment, the 2% guaranty fee ordinarily due pursuant to  107.210(d)(1)
will be offset against the 3% commitment fee already paid. No additional payment will be necessary.
With the exception of some minor changes in wording, the proposed rule is otherwise adopted without change.
Effective immediately, any Licensee may submit an application for SBA's conditional commitment to reserve Leverage.
The Application must be accompanied by the same financial information and other documentation as is required of Licensees
applying for Leverage, except that no securities forms should accompany an application for SBA's commitment. For
a Licensee wishing to participate in the next scheduled pooling of Leverage securities, and also wishing to obtain
SBA's conditional commitment for future Leverage, separate applications should be filed.
A determination to grant a Licensee's request for a commitment will be made only after SBA reviews the applicant's
financial and regulatory status as well as its representation as to projected needs. The actual amount of a commitment
which SBA will approve for a particular Licensee will depend in part on factors other than the applicant Licensee's
own financial and regulatory situation, including such matters as the anticipated need for Leverage by all other
Licensees making Leverage requests and the amount of program authority appropriated by Congress for the fiscal year.
The commitment, when granted, will represent a conditional agreement on SBA's part to permit a Licensee to make draws
against an agreed upon reserved amount of Leverage over a fixed period of time.
As a condition to a commitment's taking effect, the Licensee must pay a non-refundable commitment fee in the amount
discussed above. Payment must be received within thirty days following SBA's issuance of the commitment, or prior
to any draw against the commitment if requested within such thirty day period. When a Licensee issuing pooled securities
draws against SBA's commitment, the amount of the user fee associated with the guarantee of the Licensee's security
or securities will be debited against an account holding the commitment fees and credited against an account holding
guaranty fees. Failure to make timely and full payment of the commitment fee will preclude any draws against the commitment,
and will cause SBA's commitment to lapse automatically at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth calendar day following
SBA's issuance of the commitment.
In any case, as mentioned above, SBA's commitment will also lapse at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 60th calendar day
preceding the close of the next full Federal fiscal year following issuance of such commitment. Under present law,
the Federal fiscal year ends on September 30. Therefore, depending upon when within a given Federal fiscal year a commitment
was extended, the term of the commitment may be as short as ten months or as long as twenty-two months.
Requests for a draw may be submitted at any time during the term of the commitment. It is contemplated that requests
for a draw of pooled securities will, eventually, be funded as frequently as twice a month. Requests for a draw of preferred
securities may be funded at any time. The minimum amount of any draw of pooled securities will be $1,000,000, with integral
multiples of $100,000 permitted thereafter. Requests for draws of preferred securities may be in any amount.

As was explained in the proposed rule, SBA's present general practice, which is not proposed to be changed (and which
SBA is extending to Participating Securities) is to extend invitations to Licensees to participate in the creation
of a pool of SBA-guaranteed Debentures, against which a public offering of SBA-guaranteed trust or pool certificates,
each evidencing a fractional interest in the pool, is made to long-term investors. Such pools are formed and certificates
sold every three months, give or take a few days. Preceding the closing of the sale of the pool certificates there is
a ten-day period during which no more Debentures may be considered for inclusion in the pool. During that ten-day period,
the rate of interest on Debentures or of Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities is determined.

When a Licensee requests a draw, it will be deemed to have authorized SBA to guarantee its security immediately, and
to have authorized SBA, acting as the Licensee's agent, to sell such security to a short-term investor that will agree
to hold the Licensee's security until the Licensee's security is put into the next pool, or is repurchased by the Licensee,
or is repurchased by SBA because of a definitive determination based on subsequently-received adverse information
concerning the Licensee's credit or regulatory status.

If the security is a Debenture, it will be sold to a short-term investor at a discount, calculated as if the maturity
date of the Debenture were the next scheduled closing date for the sale of pool certificates. The Licensee will also
agree to the payment of additional interest to the short-term investor, at the same rate used to calculate the discount,
for each day that the sale of pool certificates is delayed beyond the scheduled date. While payment to the short-term
investor of all interest accrued from the date of sale to the actual closing date shall be the responsibility of the
Licensee, it shall be guaranteed by SBA. The Licensee's failure to make full payment of such additional interest shall
constitute an event giving rise to a condition affecting the Licensee's good standing under SBA's regulations. If
the Licensee's security is a Participating Security, the same conditions will apply, however, the Participating
Security will be sold to a short-term investor at a price equal to the face amount thereof.

Although SBA guarantees the Licensee's undertaking to the short-term investor concerning payment of interest on
a Debenture or Prioritized Payments on a Participating Security on the date such Debenture or Participating Security
is pooled, the Licensee does not warrant, nor does SBA guarantee, that pooling will take place on any specific date.
The short-term investor assumes the risk that the recovery of its invested principal and the receipt of interest or
Prioritized Payments will be delayed to the extent that the pool closing is delayed. Based on historical experience,
it is unlikely that any such delay will occur and if it does, the duration of the delay should be minimal. The rate at which
the Licensee's Debenture will be discounted or at which the Prioritized Payments will accumulate on a Participating
Security when either of these securities are sold to a short-term investor will, in both cases, be determined with
reference to the current average market yield on obligations of the United States with comparable periods to maturity.
However, for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or of Prioritized Payments payable to a short-term investor,
``maturity'' refers to the next scheduled pooling date, not the stated maturity date of the security in question.

In the normal course of events, when the sale of pool certificates closes, the Licensee's security will be included
in the pool, having been purchased, as previously agreed, from the short-term investor with the Licensee's share
of the proceeds of the sale of SBA guaranteed certificates issued against the pool.

The sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not obligate SBA to include that
security in a pool of long-term securities in disregard of subsequently-obtained information calling into question
either the Licensee's financial soundness or the Licensee's compliance with applicable regulations. If SBA determines
to withhold its guarantee of the Licensee's security to the pool, SBA will purchase the Licensee's security from the
short-term investor on or before the pool closing date.

Sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not cut off the Licensee's right
to withdraw its security from entering into the pool by repurchasing it directly from the short-term investor if notice
is given to SBA at least ten days prior to the pool cut-off date. However, since the sale of the Licensee's security to
a short-term investor, and not the subsequent pooling of the security, is the event that discharges SBA from its reservation
obligation to the extent of the security's face amount, the Licensee's subsequent repurchase of its security from
the short-term investor does not re-obligate SBA under the terms of its commitment, or restore SBA's guarantee authority
to the extent of the face amount of the repurchased security.

SBA's approval of an application for a commitment does not lock in any interest or Prioritized Payment rate, nor does
SBA's guarantee of a security sold to a short-term investor indicate in any way what the Licensee's interest or Prioritized
Payment rate will be when the security is pooled and certificates are sold to long-term investors.

Once in the hands of the pool trustee, the Licensee's Debenture or Participating Security will assume all the terms
and characteristics of the other securities in the pool, including an interest or Prioritized Payment rate recalculated
with reference to the maturities of the other securities being pooled.



Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12778, and With the Regulatory Flexibility and Paperwork Reduction
Acts



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This final rule will not constitute a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 because
it is not likely to have an annual impact on the national economy of $100 million or more, and, for purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, it will not have a substantial impact upon a significant number of small entities.

1. The legal basis for this final regulation is section 308(c) of the Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 687(c),
and section 20(a)(2) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631 (note) as amended by section 414 of Pub. L. 102-366.

2. The potential benefits of this final regulation have been set forth in the discussion above, under Supplementary
Information.

3. The potential cost of this final regulation cannot be quantified or estimated.

4. There are no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this final rule.

5. SBA is not aware of regulatory alternatives that could achieve the same objectives at lower cost.

This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12612



SBA certifies that this final regulation has no federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.



Executive Order 12278



For the purposes of Executive Order 12278, SBA certifies that this final rule is drafted, to the extent practicable,
in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This final regulation will impose an additional record-keeping requirement on those Licensees that voluntarily
avail themselves of the benefit of this final rule. Viewing the matter from the Licensee's standpoint, the additional
burden of preparing a quarterly short-form financial statement is offset by the assurance of the future availability
of Leverage and the reduction of cost resulting from elimination of the need to draw down Leverage funds long before
they may be invested in Small Concerns. From SBA's standpoint, the additional record-keeping is necessary if SBA
is not to rely upon out-dated financial information when its funds draws against its commitment.

2. Part 107 is amended by adding a new  107.215 to read as follows:



 107.215 

Commitments by SBA.



(a) 

General. 

A Licensee may apply for SBA's conditional commitment to reserve an amount of Leverage against which SBA may purchase
its Preferred Securities or guarantee its Debentures or Participating Securities as and when offered for future
public sales. The amount of any such commitment shall be not less than $1,000,000 but not more than 100 percent of Regulatory
Capital. Applications shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with  107.210(b), as amended from time
to time, except to the extent that this  107.215 is inconsistent therewith.

(b) 

Commitment fees. 

The Licensee shall pay to SBA a nonrefundable fee of 3% of the face amount of the Debentures or Participating Securities
reserved under the commitment or, in the case of Preferred Securities reserved under a commitment, 1% of the issue
price of such Preferred Securities. No request for a draw will be approved unless this fee has been paid in full. The
2% fee required to be paid by issuers of Debentures or Participating Securities pursuant to  107.210(d) shall
be credited against the 3% commitment fee paid pursuant to this paragraph (b).

(c) 

Automatic cancellation of commitment. 

Unless the full amount of the commitment fee is paid by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 30th calendar day following SBA's
issuance of its commitment, the commitment shall be automatically cancelled.

(d) 

Lapse of commitment. 

Notwithstanding payment of the commitment fee, SBA's commitment shall automatically lapse at 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time on the 60th calendar day preceding the close of the next full Federal fiscal year following issuance of such commitment.

(e) 

Additional record-keeping requirements. 

Following notification that SBA's commitment has been granted, a Licensee shall submit a Financial Statement on
SBA Form 468 (Short Form) as of the close of each quarter of its fiscal year to SBA within 30 days after the close of the
quarter, or with any request for a draw that is made within such 30-day period. If a Licensee is not in compliance with
this paragraph, no draw request shall be considered.

(f) 

Draws. 

(1) 

Minimum amount of draw. 

The minimum face amount of Debentures or Participating Securities that may be issued in connection with a draw against
SBA's commitment is $1,000,000; plus multiples of $100,000 above $1,000,000. Preferred Securities may be issued
in any amount.

(2) 

Conditions to draws. 

No Licensee shall be eligible to make a draw against SBA's commitment unless it is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Act and SBA regulations (i.e., no unresolved statutory or regulatory violations); 

Provided, however, 

that a Licensee that is not in compliance may nevertheless be eligible for draws if SBA determines that

(i) The Licensee's outstanding violations are of non-substantive provisions of the Act or regulations and that the
Licensee has not repeatedly violated non-substantive provisions of the Act or regulations or

(ii) The Licensee has agreed with SBA as to a course of action for the resolution of its violations and such agreement
does not preclude the issuance of Leverage by the Licensee.

(3) 

Procedures for funding draws. 

(i) 

General. 

A request for a draw, which may be submitted at any time, is submitted in the form of a request that the Licensee's Preferred
Security be purchased by SBA; or that its Debenture or Participating Security be guaranteed by SBA, sold to a short-term
investor and subsequently included in the next pool for which the Licensee's securities are eligible. The following
documentation shall accompany each such request for a draw:

(A) If such request is submitted within 30 days following the close of the Licensee's fiscal quarter, the request shall
be accompanied by a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) reflecting the Licensee's condition as of the
close of that fiscal quarter; otherwise, the request shall be accompanied by a formal statement of no material adverse
change in financial condition since the filing of the most recent SBA Form 468 (Long or Short Form).

(B) A certified statement executed by an officer of the Licensee or of a corporate general partner of the Licensee,
or by an individual that is authorized to act as or for a general partner of the Licensee, as the case may be, representing
that to the best of its knowledge and belief the Licensee is in compliance with all provisions of the Act and SBA regulations
(i.e., no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations) or a statement as to the specific nature of any violations
of which it is aware.

(C) A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund a particular Small Concern, which statement shall also include
the name and address of the Small Concern, the amount of the Licensee's proposed Financing, and the scheduled closing
date thereof. Within 30 calendar days after the actual closing date, the Licensee shall submit an SBA Form 1031 confirming
the closing of the transaction(s) with the proceeds of the draw or, within 60 calendar days after the scheduled closing
date, the Licensee shall submit a written explanation of the failure to close. Failure to submit an accurate Form 1031
or satisfactory written explanation of failure to close will preclude consideration of any subsequent draw requests,
and may be deemed an event affecting the Licensee's good standing or constituting consent to restricted operations,
as the case may be.

(ii) 

Draw process. 

(A) 

General. 

By submitting a request for a draw, a Licensee is conclusively presumed to have authorized SBA to purchase its Preferred
Security, or to have authorized SBA or any agent or trustee designated by SBA to guaranty its Debenture or Participating
Security and to sell it with SBA's guarantee, to enter into any agreements (and to bind the Licensee to such agreements)
that may be necessary to effect:

(

1

) The sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor,

(

2

) Its purchase on the Licensee's behalf (or by the Licensee itself), and

(

3

) The subsequent pooling of that security with other securities with the same maturity date: 

Provided, however, 

That the Licensee shall retain the right to repurchase its securities upon notice to SBA at least 10 days prior to the
cut-off date for the pool in which the Licensee's security is to be included by tendering the face amount of the Debenture,
or the face amount of the Participating Security plus Earned Prioritized Payments, as the case may be, to the short-term
investor.

(B) 

Debentures. 

An SBA guaranteed Debenture shall be sold to a short-term investor at a discount calculated with reference to a rate
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with Section 303(b) of the Act (but without regard to any
interest subsidy to which the Licensee may be otherwise entitled), as if the maturity date of the Debenture were the
next scheduled date for the sale of pool certificates: 

Provided, however, 

That if the actual sale of pool certificates shall take place after the scheduled date, the Licensee shall pay to the
short-term investor, on the actual sale date, an additional sum equal to daily interest as scheduled on the Debenture,
at the same rate, from the scheduled sale date to the actual sale date. Failure to make such interest payment on the closing
date shall constitute an event giving rise to a condition affecting the Licensee's good standing.

(C) 

Participating securities. 

The Licensee's Participating Security shall be sold to a short-term investor for a sum equal to the face amount thereof.
The Licensee shall undertake, with SBA's guarantee, to pay the short-term investor, at the closing of the next scheduled
sale of pool certificates, Prioritized Payments as scheduled on the Security at a rate determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury in accordance with Section 303(b) of the Act, as if the maturity date of the Participating Security
were the next scheduled date for the sale pool certificates.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Airbus Model A320 series airplanes.
This action requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to instruct
the flight crew to maintain a flap setting of configuration full (CONF FULL) during landing. This amendment is prompted
by a report of severe control difficulties which occurred on approach with the flaps locked in CONF FULL and the landing
gear down. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane
during approach.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, the FAA received a report that a Model A320 series airplane experienced severe control difficulties on
approach with the flaps locked in configuration full (CONF FULL) and the landing gear down. In this incident, the Electronic
Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) system directed the flight crew to select configuration (CONF) 3 for landing.
When the flight crew placed the slats/flaps lever in CONF 3, the slats retracted from 27 degrees to 22 degrees, but the
flaps remained locked in the full position (40 degrees). Consequently, the flight crew engaged the autopilot, which
resulted in the lateral control laws responding to the corresponding CONF 3. In turbulent conditions, this configuration
may lead to serious lateral oscillation with the autopilot engaged or to an increase of the lateral sensitivity in
manual control. This condition, if not corrected, could result in severely reduced controllability of the airplane
during approach.



Airbus has issued A320/A321 Flight Manual Temporary Revision 9.99.99/20, dated June 14, 1994, which provides the
flight crew with modified procedures for flaps fault/locked condition. These modified procedures instruct the
flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during landing approaches.

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation
Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent severely reduced controllability of the
airplane during approach. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition may be temporarily addressed by revising
the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise the flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during
landing approaches. This AFM revision is to be accomplished in accordance with the information specified in the Airbus
document described previously.

This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.



Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``

ADDRESSES.

'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-121-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption
``

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final Regulatory Amendments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its loan guaranty regulations to increase from $700 to $850 the
maximum allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services incurred
by the holder in liquidating a loan guaranteed by VA. Increasing the maximum allowable amount will make it easier for
holders to retain experience legal counsel to perform required foreclosures in a timely manner.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 22, 1993, VA published in the Federal Register (58 FR 49253) proposed regulations on increasing the maximum
allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services. Five comments were
received on the proposed amendments. Four commenters approved of the change. One commenter stated that increasing
the maximum allowable amount will not make it easier to retain experienced counsel in areas where the local VA offices
do not choose to reimburse attorneys the maximum allowable amount. This commenter further suggested that the local
offices be required to raise the amount they reimburse attorneys to the maximum allowable amount.


The regulations are adopted as originally proposed. The suggestion that regional offices be required to pay the maximum
allowable amount when they reimburse attorneys has not been adopted. We believe that local VA offices have the experience
and knowledge necessary to determine the appropriate level of attorney and trustee fees for foreclosure processing
in their various areas of jurisdiction.
The Secretary hereby certifies that the final regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
Increasing the amount VA will reimburse holders for trustee's fees and legal services will make it easier for holders
to retain experienced legal counsel to perform required foreclosures.

Background 



On July 15, 1994, we published a final rule implementing sections 9312(c)(2), 9312(f) and 9434(b) of Public Law 99-509,
section 7 of Public Law 100-93, section 4014 of Public Law 100-203, sections 224 and 411(k) of Public Law
100-360, and section 6411(d)(3) of Public Law 101-239. These provisions broadened the Secretary's authority
to impose intermediate sanctions and civil money penalties on health maintenance organizations (HMOs), competitive
medical plans and other prepaid health plans contracting under Medicare or Medicaid that (1) substantially fail
to provide an enrolled individual with required medically necessary items and services; (2) engage in certain marketing,
enrollment, reporting or claims payment abuses; or (3) in the case of Medicare risk-contracting plans, employ or
contract with, either directly or indirectly, an individual or entity excluded from participation in Medicare.

 1003.103

Amount of penalty. 


(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, the OIG may impose a penalty of not more than $2,000
for each item or service that is subject to a determination under  1003.102. 


* * * * * 


(f)(1) The OIG may, in addition to or in lieu of other remedies available under law, impose a penalty of up to $25,000
for each determination by HCFA that a contracting organization has_
(i) Failed substantially to provide an enrollee with required medically necessary items and services and the failure
adversely affects (or has the likelihood of adversely affecting) the enrollee; 
(ii) Imposed premiums on enrollees in excess of amounts permitted under section 1876 or title XIX of the Act; 
(iii) Acted to expel or to refuse to re-enroll a Medicare beneficiary in violation of the provisions of section 1876
of the Act and for reasons other than the beneficiary's health status or requirements for health care services; 
(iv) Misrepresented or falsified information furnished to an individual or any other entity under section 1876 or
section 1903(m) of the Act; or 
(v) Failed to comply with the requirements of section 1876(g)(6)(A) of the Act regarding prompt payment of claims.

(2) The OIG may, in addition to or in lieu of other remedies available under law, impose a penalty of up to $25,000 for
each determination by HCFA that a contracting organization with a contract under section 1876 of the Act_
(i) Employs or contracts with individuals or entities excluded, under section 1128 or section 1128A of the Act, from
participation in Medicare for the provision of health care, utilization review, medical social work, or administrative

for health care services, or engaged in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying
or discouraging enrollment (except as permitted by section 1876 or section 1903(m) of the Act) with the contracting
organization by Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients whose medical condition or history indicates a
need for substantial future medical services. 
(4) If enrolles are charged more than the allowable premium, the OIG will impose an additional penalty equal to double
the amount of excess premium charged by the contracting organization. The excess premium amount will be deducted
from the penalty and returned to the enrollee. 
(5) The OIG will impose an additional $15,000 penalty for each individual not enrolled when HCFA determines that a
contracting organization has committed a violation described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. 
(6) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, a violation is each incident where a person has committed an act listed
in  417.500(a) or  434.67(a) of this title, or failed to comply with a requirement set forth in  434.80(c)
of this title.

Determinations regarding the amount of the penalty and assessment. 


(a) 

Amount of penalty.

 * * * 
(5) In determining the appropriate amount of any penalty in accordance with  1003.103(f), the OIG will consider
as appropriate_
(i) The nature and scope of the required medically necessary item or service not provided and the circumstances under
which it was not provided; 
(ii) The degree of culpability of the contracting organization; 
(iii) The seriousness of the adverse effect that resulted or could have resulted from the failure to provide required
medically necessary care; 
(iv) The harm which resulted or could have resulted from the provision of care by a person that the contracting organization
is expressly prohibited, under section 1876(i)(6) or section 1903(p)(2) of the Act, from contracting with or employing;

(v) The harm which resulted or could have resulted from the contracting organization's expulsion or refusal to re-enroll
a Medicare beneficiary or Medicaid recipient; 
(vi) The nature of the misrepresentation or fallacious information furnished by the contracting organization to
the Secretary, State, enrollee or other entity under section 1876 or section 1903(m) of the Act; 
(vii) The history of prior offenses by the contracting organization or principals of the contracting organization,
including whether, at any time prior to determination of the current violation or violations, the contracting organization
or any of its principals were convicted of a criminal charge or were held liable for civil or administrative sanctions
in connection with a program covered by this part or any other public or private program of payment for medical services;
and 
(viii) Such other matters as justice may require.

(d) In considering the factors listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, for violations subject to a determination
under  1003.103(f), the following circumstances are to be considered, as appropriate, in determining the
amount of any penalty_


(1) Nature and circumstances of the incident. 

(i) It would be considered a mitigating circumstance if, where more than one violation exists, the appropriate items
or services not provided were_


(A) Few in number, or 

(B) Of the same type and occurred within a short period of time. 

(ii) It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if such items or services were of several types and occurred
over a lengthy period of time, or if there were many such items or services (or the nature and circumstances indicate
a pattern of such items or services not being provided). 

(2) Degree of culpability. It would be considered a mitigating circumstance if the violation was the result of an unintentional,
unrecognized error, and corrective action was taken promptly after discovery of the error. 

(3) Failure to provide required care. It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if the failure to provide
required care was attributable to an individual or entity that the contracting organization is expressly prohibited
by law from contracting with or employing. 

(4) Use of excluded individuals. It would be considered an aggravating factor if the contracting organization knowingly
or routinely engages in the prohibited practice of contracting or employing, either directly or indirectly, individuals
or entities excluded from the Medicare program under section 1128 or section 1128A of the Act. 

(5) Routine practices. It would be considered an aggravating factor if the contracting organization knowingly or
routinely engages in any discriminatory or other prohibited practice which has the effect of denying or discouraging
enrollment by individuals whose medical condition or history indicates a need for substantial future medical services.


(6) Prior offenses. It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if at any time prior to determination of the
current violation or violations, the contracting organization or any of its principals was convicted on criminal
charges or held liable for civil or administrative sanctions in connection with a program covered by this part or any
other public or private program of payment for medical services. The lack of prior liability for criminal, civil,
or administrative sanctions by the contracting organization, or the principals of the contracting organization,
would not necessarily be considered a mitigating circumstance in determining civil money penalty amounts. 

(e) (1) The standards set forth in this section are binding, except to the extent that their application would result
in imposition of an amount that would exceed limits imposed by the United States Constitution. 

(2) The amount imposed will not be less than the approximate amount required to fully compensate the United States,
or any State, for its damages and costs, tangible and intangible, including but not limited to the costs attributable
to the investigation, prosecution, and administrative review of the case. 

(3) Nothing in this section will limit the authority of the Department to settle any issue or case as provided by  1003.126,
or to compromise any penalty and assessment as provided by  1003.128.

Migratory Bird Hunting: Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Certain Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands
for the 
1994-95 Late Season 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule prescribes special late season migratory bird hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian
reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands. This is in response to tribal requests for Service recognition
of their authority to regulate hunting under established guidelines. This rule is necessary to allow establishment
of season bag limits and, thus, harvest at levels compatible with populations and habitat conditions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.

), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the
distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds,
to determine when, to what extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted,
captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported or transported. 


In the August 16, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 42017), the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations
for the 1994-95 hunting season for certain Indian tribes, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985,


Federal Register

 (50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved
hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal members and
nonmembers on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting by both
tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal
frameworks but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by
tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession
limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season
length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established
under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10-September 1 closed season mandated by the
1916 Convention on the Protection of Migratory Birds Between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada). Tribes that
desired special hunting regulations in the 1994-95 hunting season were requested in the April 7, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16762) to submit a proposal that included details on: (1) requested season dates and other regulations to be
observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure
or monitor harvest; (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit
such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and
enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. No action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations
that are established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservation is located. The guidelines have been used successfully
since the 1985-86 hunting season, and they were made final beginning with the 1988-89 hunting season (August
18, 1988; 53 FR 31612).

Although the August 16, 1994, proposed rule included generalized regulations for both early and late season hunting,
this rulemaking addresses only the late season proposals. Early season hunting was addressed in the rulemaking published
in the 

Federal Register

 on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45235). As a general rule, early seasons begin during September each year and have a primary
emphasis on such species as mourning and white-winged dove. Late seasons are ordinarily those that begin in late-September
or early-October, or later, each year and have a primary emphasis on waterfowl. 
In the August 16 proposed rule, and in the early season final rule, the Service pointed out that there was reason for
cautious optimism with regard to liberalization of duck hunting regulations in the 1994-95 season. However,
at that time production information was not available and assessments could not be made on which to base final framework
decisions. From survey data, it now appears that duck production is up on a continental basis, with a projected fall
flight index of about 71 million ducks, and the Service has responded to this by making minor adjustments in regulations.
Most notably, bag limit frameworks provide for one more duck than allowed last year, with an additional mallard drake.
However, the restriction on mallard hens to one in the daily bag will remain in effect. A season on canvasbacks is optional
nationwide. Other species restrictions are still in effect. The Service has eased, somewhat, the more restrictive
regulations of past seasons because duck populations have generally rebounded from the lows of last year and several
previous years. Duck populations recovery is closely linked to more favorable water conditions throughout most
of the better duck production areas of the U.S. and Canada, as well as to more restrictive regulations imposed in the
past. However, the Service has been conservative in this liberalization because the potential is there for a more
complete recovery of populations in the future, compared to long-term averages, if water conditions stabilize and/or
continue to improve. Length of season is considered to be a factor more closely associated with determining magnitude
of harvest than is minor adjustment in bag limit so frameworks for season length across all four flyways will remain
the same. The fact that some liberalization has occurred in bag limits and season length is considered in these final
regulations, many of which were proposed before final decisions were made on late season frameworks for the States.



Tribal Proposals 


For the 1994-95 migratory bird hunting season, the Service received requests from 14 tribes and/or Indian groups
that followed the June 4, 1985, guidelines and are appropriate for rulemaking. Some of the proposals submitted by
the tribes have both early and late season elements. However, as noted earlier, 
only those with late season proposals are included in this final rulemaking; 13 tribes have proposals with late seasons.
Six tribes are represented in the early season regulations.

There have been no tribal comments or revised proposals for the late seasons received since publication of the early
season final rule. However, tribal proposals were made before late-season final frameworks for States were established.
Thus, with the liberalization that has occurred, changes have been made in some of the tribal seasons that are not reflected
in the earlier proposed rule document. 



Public Comments on Tribal Proposals 



The Service received a letter from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MIDNR), dated August 30, 1994, that
generally supports the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) migratory bird hunting proposal
in the 1836 and 1842 ceded areas of Michigan. The MIDNR did advise that State rules had been modified to limit the take
of brant to no more than two daily within a daily bag of seven geese. This was in response to a recent Mississippi Flyway
Council recommendation. 

The Service's view on this is that the likelihood of a hunter taking, or even seeing, a brant in an interior area is not
very great given that brant are almost exclusively a marine species. Although they are seen on occasion, records indicate
the occurrence of brant in Michigan are on a ``rare'' to ``extremely rare'' basis. Establishment of a guideline or
regulation to restrict the daily bag limit of brant to two is somewhat meaningless in that context. Nevertheless,
as it would seem that the regulation is in part designed to protect the hunter, the Service will defer to the GLIFWC to
decide for next season how they will propose to respond to the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation and the State
of Michigan establishment of regulations for brant harvest. For this current season, after consultation with both
the MIDNR and the GLIFWC, the potential problem has been taken care of through inclusion of brant in the ``Other Geese''
category of the GLIFWC regulations. 

Other comments from States regarding tribally proposed regulations, received earlier, were addressed in the early
season final rule published on September 1, 1994. 

In summary, this rule amends section 20.110 of 50 CFR to make current for the late 1994-95 migratory bird hunting
season the regulations that will apply on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands.
These regulations take into account the liberalization that the Service has determined is biologically feasible
for this current season, based on improved production. 



NEPA Consideration 



Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)),
the ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory
Birds (FES-75-74)'' was filed with the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice of
availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 13, 1975, (40 FR 25241). A supplement to the final environmental statement, the ``Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88-14)''
was filed on June 9, 1988, and notice of availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22727). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment
titled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is
available from the Service. 



Endangered Species Act Considerations 



Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The
Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes
of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out * * * is not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction
or adverse modification of [critical] habitat * * *'' Consequently, the Service initiated Section
7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for the proposed migratory bird hunting seasons including those
which occur on Federally recognized Indian reservations and ceded lands. The Service's biological opinion resulting
from its consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public in, and will be available
to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Office of Migratory Bird Management,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. Copies of these documents are
available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption 

ADDRESSES. 

In an August 1994 opinion, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, 
and the Paperwork Reduction Act



In the April 7 

Federal Register

, the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of
1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and Executive Order 12866. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects, preparing a Small Entity
Flexibility Analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and publishing a summary of the latter. This information
is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget under Executive Order 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval
by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. 



Authorship 



The primary author of this final rule is Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Office of Migratory Bird Management. 



Regulations Promulgation 



The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting must, by its very nature, operate under severe time constraints.
However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity
to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed hunting regulations for certain tribes were published on August
16, 1994, the Service established the longest possible period for public comments. In doing this, the Service recognized
that time would be of the essence. However, the comment period provided the maximum amount of time possible while ensuring
that this final rule would be published before the late hunting season beginning on September 24, 1994. 

Under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, as amended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.

), the Service prescribes final hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian reservations (including
off-reservation trust lands), and ceded lands. The regulations specify the species to be hunted and establish season
dates, bag and possession limits, season length, and shooting hours for migratory game birds other than waterfowl.


Therefore, for the reasons set out above, the Service finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C.
553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and this final rule will take effect on September 24, 1994.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure of the General category fishery. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that the 33 metric tons (mt) set-aside for the late-season General category quota beginning September
15, will be taken by September 16, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 1200 hours
on Saturday, September 17, 1994, except that 8 mt will remain available for the New York Bight fishery beginning September
20, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq.

) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found
at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. 


Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt
of large medium and giant ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category.
Of this amount, 65 mt are to be set aside for a late-season fishery beginning September 15. Based on landings statistics,
the fishery was closed on August 15, 1994, with only 23 mt remaining for the late-season set-aside. A reallocation
of 18 mt from the reserve increased the set-aside to 41 mt, of which 33 mt were allocated to General category fishermen
from all areas to be fished from September 15 through September 17, and 8 mt were allocated to the New York Bight fishery
to be fished from September 20 until the 8 mt are taken. 
Based on early landing reports, it has been determined that the late-season quota of ABT allocated for the General
category will be exceeded by greater than 100 percent if the fishery remains open for the planned 3 days. However, given
the need to provide sufficient notice to vessels already at sea, and out of equity and safety concerns for fishermen
returning to port with legally-caught bluefin, it has been decided to effect the closure as of noon on Saturday. 
Fishing for, retention of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant ABT by vessels in the General category must
cease by 1200 hours September 17, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota to such an extent
that subtractions of the overage would seriously and adversely impact the 1995 fishery for this category. 
This closure of the late-season General category fishery will not affect the 8 mt set-aside for the New York Bight or
other categories fishing for ABT. As of this date, the Incidental, Angling, and Harpoon categories remain open, and
the Purse Seine category is subject to individual quotas. 


Classification 


This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.20(b) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

Single Family Property Disposition Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal 
Housing Commissioner, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule makes final, with changes, the amendments to regulations at 24 CFR parts 203 and 291 announced in an interim
rule published on October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54244), with an effective date of November 19, 1993. The regulations govern
the disposition of HUD-acquired single family properties (part 291) and the circumstances under which HUD will accept
such properties when they are occupied (part 203). The preamble to this final rule responds to the comments received
from the public on the interim rule.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The amendments made in this rule do not affect the information collection requirements for the Single Family Property
Disposition program, which were previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork
Reduction Act and assigned OMB control numbers 2502-0306. 


I. Background


Title II of the National Housing Act (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages for single family residences through
the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program. The disposition program for
single family properties, acquired by HUD in exchange for payment of insurance claims, is authorized by section 204(g)
of the Act. The regulations governing the disposition program are codified at 24 CFR part 291. 
On October 20, 1993, the Department published an interim rule, which subsequently became effective on November 19,
1993, amending certain provisions of part 291 to allow for greater flexibility in fluctuating market situations
and to provide greater opportunities for affordable housing to families and to State and local governments or nonprofit
organizations serving low- and moderate-income families. The purpose of the amendments was to implement the policy
of President Clinton and Secretary Cisneros to expand access to affordable homeownership and help revitalize neighborhoods.

II. Amendments Made by Interim Rule


Single Family Property Disposition (24 CFR Part 291) 


1. The purpose of the disposition program was changed to place greater emphasis on homeownership and improvement
of neighborhoods, by providing that the primary objective of the program is to reduce the inventory of acquired properties
in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures
a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund. (24 CFR 291.1(a).) 
2. A definition of ``revitalization areas'' was added, which defined the term as urban neighborhoods that are targeted
by a city for coordinating affordable housing programs and enhanced supportive services, and where a significant
number of HUD-owned properties have been in inventory at least six months. (24 CFR 291.5.) 
3. Purchase money mortgages (PMMs) in revitalization areas were made available for 85 percent of the purchase price,
at current market interest rates, for a period not to exceed five years for direct sale purchasers (

i.e.

, governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations) meeting FHA mortgage credit standards and purchasing
properties for ultimate resale to owner-occupant purchasers at or below 115 percent of median income. (24 CFR 291.100(d).)

4. The definition of owner-occupant purchaser was amended to limit it to purchasers who intend to occupy the property
as their primary residence. (The rule had previously included governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations
as owner-occupant purchasers.) (24 CFR 291.5.) 
5. Owner-occupant purchasers were given a priority in the competitive bid sales method. In revitalization areas,
the priority was made available for up to 30 days and only for properties offered with FHA mortgage insurance. In all
other areas, the priority was made available for all properties for a period of time to be set by the field office, depending
on local circumstances. (24 CFR 291.105(a).) 
6. The limitation on the amount of financing and closing costs that HUD pays was removed, and the rule was amended to
provide that HUD will determine the maximum limit appropriate for the area. (24 CFR 291.105(b).) 
7. The discount available on direct sale purchases was changed from 10 percent to an amount to be determined appropriate
by HUD, but not less than 10 percent, depending on the location of the property or the number of properties purchased
in a single transaction. (24 CFR 291.110 (a) and (b).) 
8. The procedure by which potential purchasers under the direct sales program are notified of eligible properties
was amended. (24 CFR 291.110(a).) 
9. A provision was added to allow for a direct sale to an individual or other entity not otherwise specified in the rule
where a finding is made, in writing, that such a sale would further the goals of the National Housing Act and would be
in the best interests of the Secretary. (24 CFR 291.110(g).) 
10. The rule was amended to permit initial 15-day extensions for closing at no cost to owner-occupant purchasers where
documentation indicates that (1) proper and timely loan application was made, (2) the delay is not the fault of the
buyer, and (3) mortgage approval is imminent. A further amendment allowed extensions at no cost, at any time and to
any purchaser, where the delay is the fault of HUD or a direct endorsement lender. (24 CFR 291.130(b).) 
11. An amendment was made to provide that, in the case of an uninsured sale, 100 percent of an earnest money deposit made
by an owner-occupant purchaser will be returned where the purchaser is pre-approved for mortgage financing in an
appropriate amount by a recognized mortgage lender and, despite good faith efforts, is unable to obtain mortgage
financing; and, where an owner-occupant purchaser has not been preapproved and despite good faith efforts cannot
obtain mortgage financing, 50 percent of the earnest money deposit will be returned. (24 CFR 291.135.) A definition
of ``pre-approved'' was added to mean that a commitment has been obtained from a recognized mortgage lender for mortgage
financing in a specified dollar amount sufficient to purchase the property. (24 CFR 291.5.)

Occupied Conveyance (24 CFR Part 203) 


The occupied conveyance rule at 24 CFR 203.670 and 203.671 was amended to provide that HUD may accept occupied properties
to avoid the payment of excessive eviction or relocation expenses required by a local government. A technical correction
was also being made to   203.675(b)(4) and 203.676 to conform with an earlier amendment to the rule published
on September 16, 1991 (56 FR 46964) regarding the conveyance of properties occupied by persons who suffer a long-term
or permanent illness. 


III. Public Comments


The Department received 40 public comments during the 60-day comment period that ended on December 20, 1993. The comments
were from governmental entities, private nonprofit organizations, and three members of Congress. 
The comments are discussed below. Numbers in parentheses following the comment refer to the number of commenters
raising the issue. 


Comment:

 HUD should continue to give a priority to purchase (and lease, in the case of homeless providers) to nonprofits and
government agencies, particularly grantees under HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes (HOPE 3). (36) 


Response:

 The Department agrees that changes to its procedures for offering properties to governmental entities and nonprofit
organizations are appropriate. The final rule has been changed to include governmental entities and nonprofit organizations
in the definition of owner-occupant purchasers, thereby giving them a simultaneous opportunity to purchase properties
eligible for FHA mortgage insurance during the competitive bidding period. If a nonprofit or government agency submits
the highest net offer, 

without

 any discount being considered, and that offer is otherwise acceptable, it will be accepted and a discount of 10 percent
(15 percent if five or more properties are purchased and closed simultaneously), regardless of the property's location,
will be applied at closing. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, nonprofits and government agencies
will have first opportunity to purchase at HUD's determination of fair market value. Offers accepted will reflect
the appropriate discount. For properties offered without FHA mortgage insurance, the discount will be 30 percent
in revitalization areas, and 10 percent in all other areas (or 15 percent, as appropriate). 


Comment:

 In establishing revitalization areas, the number of FHA foreclosures in process should be taken into consideration
rather than the number of properties currently on hand. (7) 


Response:

 Due to the several uncertainties surrounding foreclosures (payoff by mortgagor, purchase by third parties, bankruptcy,
redemption periods, the varying length of time in which foreclosure occurs, etc.), the Department believes that
the use of foreclosures in process is not practical in establishing revitalization areas. The Department continues
to believe it is appropriate to establish revitalization areas based on experience with its property disposition
program and based on areas designated by localities for expanding affordable housing opportunities. 


Comment:

 The discount in revitalization areas should be greater. (4) 


Response:

 The available discount is based on anticipated savings to the Department, both in terms of selling on a direct basis
and in selling properties more quickly that may otherwise require extended periods of marketing. The amount is supported
by an evaluation performed on the Single Family Property Disposition Demonstration Program conducted by the Department
on sales of properties in economically distressed areas. The Department believes that the current discount level
is appropriate, but retains flexibility in making future determinations based on changing housing market conditions.



Comment:

 There should be a requirement for owner-occupant buyers to repair to code. (3) 


Response:

 The Department believes that such a requirement, and its enforcement, properly rests with the local government.



Comment:

 The program should be monitored and reports provided to the public. (3) 


Response:

 The Department does not believe there is an urgent need to devote already scarce resources to large scale monitoring
of this unsubsidized program. To the extent the Department learns of falsification of the Sales Contract, or other
abuses in the program, corrective measures will be taken at that time. In this regard, steps have been taken to determine
the appropriateness of having the Department's computer system perform limited checking on owner-occupants purchasing
more than one principal residence. Also, the Sales Contract now includes a warning to purchasers about the possible
consequences of falsifying that document. The Department has recently authorized Field Offices to include resale
restrictions on certain properties to prevent windfall profits and require that the properties be used for affordable
housing goals. A provision has been added to the final rule at  291.110(a)(3) to authorize the Department to
request information when considered appropriate on the disposition of properties sold to governmental entities
and nonprofits. Consideration is also being given to other administrative procedures to prevent abuse from all categories
of buyers. 


Comment:

 Minimum residency requirements for owner-occupant buyers should be established. (2) 


Response:

 The Department does not agree that such requirements should be established. Unnecessary hardships could be placed
on owner-occupants in some cases where job relocations or other circumstances may necessitate moving. As discussed
above, the Department has taken some measures already, and is considering others, to prevent possible abuses.

Comment: 

The number of properties nonprofits may purchase should be limited and based on the number they have completed successfully.
(2) 



Response: 

Nonprofit organizations are currently eligible to purchase discounted properties based on differing pre-qualification
standards. While the Department believes it would not be in its best interests to require a second approval, nonprofits
not previously approved under another HUD program will generally be subject to requirements much like those used
in the HOPE 3 program as a condition to purchasing properties at discounted prices. (See the HOPE 3 regulations at 24
CFR part 572.) In addition, the Department may specify a required minimum number of properties to be completed successfully,
before the purchase of additional properties. 



Comment: 

In pricing HUD properties, appraisers should use distressed properties as comparables. (2) 



Response: 

HUD believes its procedure for pricing properties, regardless of their location, is a fair one. Appraisers utilize
recent sales of comparable properties in similar condition, and HUD's listing price is reflective of the needed level
of repairs. 



Comment: 

HUD should continue to provide lists of available properties. (2)



Response: 

HUD's Field Offices are required by  291.110(a) to provide lists of properties available for direct purchase
upon request. Where Field Offices have provided lists routinely, they have not been instructed to discontinue the
practice, and some are continuing that practice. To eliminate unnecessary and duplicative work, however, some offices
may elect to have the newspaper advertisement, where such advertising is used, also serve as official notification
to the nonprofits and government agencies. In areas where newspapers are not used to advertise properties, other
means must be used to notify nonprofits and government agencies of available properties in a timely manner. In those
instances where properties being offered without FHA mortgage insurance are first made available to nonprofits
and government agencies, Field Offices will continue to provide lists directly to those potential purchasers. The
Department does not believe this practice creates a hardship on program participants. 



Comment: 

A process should be established for nonprofits to appeal Field Office decisions. (1) 



Response: 

The Department does not believe such a process is necessary and, in fact, could serve to undermine the authority vested
in HUD's Field Offices. HUD headquarters will continue to oversee the program and to discuss issues with both the buyer
community and its Field Offices in order to reach fair and appropriate decisions. The Department does not see the necessity
of a formal appeal process to accomplish this. 



Comment: 

A means should be developed for low-income buyers to compete better with higher income owner-occupant purchasers.
(1) 



Response: 

The Department believes that restricting sales only to buyers under a specific income limit could be viewed as discriminatory,
unfair to other owner-occupant buyers, and not in the best interests of the Department or the FHA insurance fund, in
its efforts to dispose of the inventory in a timely manner and at the maximum return to the insurance funds. Changes
made in this final rule to give a priority purchase period to governmental agencies and nonprofits on certain properties
will enhance the opportunity of low-income purchasers to acquire properties through programs sponsored by those
agencies and organizations. 



Comment: 

Investors should not be allowed to purchase properties. (1) 



Response: 

The Department has significantly restricted the opportunity for investors to purchase. In the case of properties
eligible for FHA mortgage insurance (those generally in better condition), owner-occupants (which includes nonprofits
and government agencies) have first opportunity to purchase. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance,
the nonprofits and government agencies have first opportunity to purchase, followed by other owner-occupant buyers,
before being offered to all purchasers. It should be kept in mind that there will be certain properties, due to their
physical condition, that will not be purchased by any owner-occupant purchaser, so it would not be in the best interests
of the Department to eliminate totally the investor buyer from this program.

Comment: 

A discount in the sales price should be given to owner-occupants who have received certificates for completing homebuyer
education seminars. (1) 


Response: 

Although the Department recognizes the value of homeownership counseling programs, it does not believe the suggestion
would be in its best interests. It is unlikely that there would be any ``standard'' by which certificates would be issued
to potential buyers by the many different organizations providing such counseling. Further, the discount offered
by HUD is justified primarily by the savings to the Department on direct sales to nonprofits and government agencies.
These same savings (sales commission, closing/financing costs, and expected holding costs) would not be realized
in sales to other than direct sale buyers. Although the Department will not sell to owner-occupant buyers that are
not government agencies or nonprofits at discounted prices, properties purchased at the deep discount by those organizations
are primarily intended to be resold to persons who are at or below 115 percent of median income for their area, when adjusted
for family size, or used to shelter the homeless. Therefore, the program will enhance affordable homeownership opportunities.




Comment: 

Consideration should be given to accepting purchase offers from direct sale buyers that are below asking price. (1)




Response: 

This action clearly would not be in the Department's best interests. At the time properties are available for direct
purchase, the asking prices are based on very recent appraisals and the Department has no reason to believe those prices
are not reflective of true market value. To accept offers below those prices would effectively increase the discount
the Department is willing to provide and undermine the return to the mortgage insurance funds. If properties remain
available at the time of offering to the general public, those buyers who previously could purchase direct then have
the opportunity to bid competitively and may, in fact, submit offers below the asking price at that time. 


Comment: 

Homeless providers should be permitted to purchase only in nonrevitalization areas. (1) 


Response: 

An agency that is a homeless provider (and may have leased properties from the Department for that purpose) often may
be the same nonprofit or government agency that can purchase on a direct basis. Such an agency has the right to purchase
properties it has leased, regardless of their location. Further, the Department does not see a legitimate reason
to restrict homeless providers only to nonrevitalization areas and believes that such action would be detrimental
to the goal of expanding homeownership opportunities. 



IV. Other Amendments 



As a result of an agreement with nonprofit organizations to place certain limits on the amount of required earnest
money deposits, thus alleviating possible hardships on owner-occupant purchasers, the Department has determined
that the amount of such a deposit on a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less shall be $500, except that for vacant
lots the amount shall be 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000, the deposit
shall be set by the Field Office in an amount not less than $500 or more than $2,000. This amendment is made in this final
rule at  291.105(h)(1). 



V. Other Matters



Findings made under the National Environmental Policy Act, Executive Orders on Federalism and The Family, and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act that were discussed in the preamble to the interim rule are not affected by any changes
made in this final rule. 

This rule was listed as sequence number 1594 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published at 59
FR 20424, 20449 on April 25, 1994, under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Accordingly, the interim rule amending 24 CFR parts 203 and 291 published on October 20, 1993 at 58 FR 54244 through
54248 is adopted as final, with further amendments to part 291 to read as follows: 


PART 291_DISPOSITION OF HUD-ACQUIRED SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY 


1. The authority citation for part 291 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 12 U.S.C. 1709 and 1715(b); 42 U.S.C. 1441, 1441a, and 3535(d). 



2. Section 291.5 is amended by removing the definition for ``Direct sale purchaser'', and revising the definitions
of ``Owner-occupant purchaser'' and ``Revitalization area'', to read as follows: 


 291.5 

Definitions. 


* * * * * 




Owner-occupant purchaser 

means a purchaser who intends to use the property as his or her principal residence; a State, governmental entity,
tribe, or agency thereof; or a private nonprofit organization as defined in  291.405 of this part. For purposes
of this part, a State means any of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,
and any other territory or possession of the United States. Governmental entities include those with general governmental
powers (

e.g.

, a city or county), as well as those with limited or special powers (

e.g.

, public housing agencies). 


* * * * * 




Revitalization area 

means a neighborhood that has a significant concentration of vacant properties, including properties needing extensive
repairs that have been in HUD's inventory at least six months, or a longer period as determined appropriate by the Secretary;
exhibits other characteristics of economic distress; and has been targeted by the locality for establishing affordable
housing and providing adequate supportive services. 


* * * * * 


3. In  291.100, paragraph (d)(2) and the last sentence of paragraph (h) are revised to read as follows: 


 291.100 

General policy. 


(d) * * * 
(2) In revitalization areas, HUD, in its sole discretion, may take back purchase money mortgages (PMMs) on property
purchased by governmental entities or private nonprofit organizations who buy property for ultimate resale to owner-occupant
purchasers with incomes at or below 115 percent of the area median income. When offered by HUD, PMMs will be available
for 85 percent of the purchase price, at market rate interest, for a period not to exceed five years. Mortgagors must
meet FHA mortgage credit standards. 


* * * * * 


(h) 

Open listings.

 * * * Purchasers participating in the competitive sales program, except government entities and nonprofit organizations,
must submit bids through a participating broker. 


* * * * * 


4. In  291.105, paragraphs (a) and (h)(1) are revised, to read as follows: 


 291.105 

Competitive sales procedure. 


(a) 

General. 

(1) Properties are sold to the general public on a competitive bid basis through local real estate brokers except as
provided in  291.100(h). If a property fails to generate an acceptable bid or offer during the bidding period,
it will remain on the market for an extended listing period, as described in paragraph (f) of this section. If a property's
price or terms are changed, it will again be subject to another competitive bidding period.

(2) For properties being offered with mortgage insurance, priority will be given to owner-occupant purchasers,
as defined in  291.5, for a period of up to 30 days, as determined by HUD. For all other properties (i.e., properties
not offered with mortgage insurance), priority will be given to governmental entities and nonprofit organizations
prior to other owner-occupant purchasers.

(h) 

Earnest money deposits. 

(1) The amount of earnest money deposit required for a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less is $500, except
that for vacant lots the amount is 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000,
the amount of earnest money deposit required in the area is set by the Field Office, in an amount not less than $500 or
more than $2,000. In determining the amount of earnest money deposits, a Field Office considers comparable practice
in the locality, area real estate market conditions, the type of offers generally received, and the ability of the
area's typical buyers to secure financing. Information on the amount of the required earnest money deposit is available
from the Field Office or participating real estate brokers. 


* * * * * 


5. Section 291.110 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and revising the phrase ``field office manager'' to read ``Field
Office'' in paragraph (b)(1), to read as follows: 


 291.110 

Other sales procedures. 


(a) 

Direct sales of properties without mortgage insurance to governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations.


(1) State and local governments, public agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been
preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties
directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10
percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs. The amount of the discount may vary, depending on the
area, the type of sale, or the number of properties purchased and closed in a single transaction. 
(2)(i) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest, by ZIP code,
to appropriate HUD Field Offices. Upon request, for those properties not eligible for mortgage insurance, and before
they are publicly listed, Field Offices will notify governmental entities and nonprofit organizations in writing
when eligible properties become available in the areas designated by them. Field Offices will coordinate the dissemination
of the information to ensure that where more than one purchaser designates a specific area, those purchasers receive
the list of properties at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the purchasers. Properties
will be sold on a first come-first served basis. 
(ii) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must notify HUD of preliminary interest in specific properties
within five days of the notification of available properties (where notification is by mail, the five days will begin
to run five days after mailing). Those properties in which purchasers express an interest will be held off the market
for a ten-day consideration and inspection period. Other properties on the list will continue to be processed for
public sale. HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for a purchaser at any one time, based upon the
purchaser's financial capacity as determined by HUD and upon past performance in HUD programs. At the end of the ten-day
consideration and inspection period, properties in which no governmental entity or nonprofit organization has
expressed a specific intent to purchase will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. Properties in
which a governmental entity or nonprofit organization expressed an intent to purchase, during the ten-day period,
will continue to be held off the market pending receipt of the sales contract. If a sales contract is not received within
a time period of up to ten days, as determined by HUD, following expiration of the ten-day consideration and inspection
period, and no other governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed an interest, then the property
will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. 
(3) In order to ensure that properties purchased at a discount are being utilized for expanding affordable housing
opportunities, HUD may require, as appropriate, periodic, limited information regarding the purchase and resale
of such properties, and certain restrictions on the resale of such properties.

 Final rule; correcting amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects the list published on October 21, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

, 58 FR 54412 to include those courts that were inadvertently omitted.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The authority to issue this correction is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and 25 U.S.C. 2 and 9,
and 25 U.S.C. 13 which authorizes appropriations for ``Indian judges.'' 



The final rule amending the regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Muskogee Area Tribes (Eastern Oklahoma)
to the list of tribes in Section 11.100(a) became effective January 28, 1992. Notice of a proposed rule amending the
regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe (Colorado), was published April 26, 1993.
The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe should have been included on the list contained in the revision of 25 CFR Part 11, published
October 21, 1993, at 25 CFR 11.100(a). The final rule, 25 CFR Part 11, listing tribes located in the former Oklahoma
Territory, published October 21, 1993, did not contain the Ponca Tribe (Oklahoma). These additions to 25 CFR Part
11,  11.100, 

Listing of Courts of Indian Offenses

, were inadvertently omitted from the list in the final rule, published October 21, 1993. 

Inclusion in  11.100, 

Listing of Courts of Indian Offenses,

 does not defeat the inherent sovereignty of a tribe to establish tribal courts and exercise jurisdiction under tribal
law.

since they are exercising the sovereign authority of the tribe for which the court sits.''). Such exercise of inherent
sovereignty and the establishment of tribal courts shall comply with the requirements set forth in 25 CFR Part 11,
 11.100(c). 

The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs is in receipt of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Law and Order Code which was adopted
in accordance with the Tribes' constitution and by-laws and approved by the Area Director of the Phoenix Area Office
on August 26, 1986. The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs further recognizes that the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone
Tribal Court was established in 1986 in accordance with the Tribes' constitution and by-laws; however, the Tribe
was inadvertently left on the list of Courts of Indian Offenses. This correction will delete Fallon Paiute-Shoshone
from the list. 

Having reconsidered earlier Departmental opinions interpreting the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa, the
Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs also recognizes the court of the Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe
as established in accordance with the Tribes' constitution. This correction will delete Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota
Chippewa Tribe from the list. 

The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these final regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866
and, therefore, will not require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget. 

This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). 

In accordance with E.O. 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications.
The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that this correction does not constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 

This correction does not contain information collection requirements which require the approval of the Office of
Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

Sale of HUD-Held Multifamily Mortgages

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule sets forth the basic policies and procedures that govern the disposition of HUD-held multifamily project
mortgages.

1

 In general, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. However, the Department will
not sell delinquent mortgages if foreclosure is unavoidable and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by
low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent
of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage. In addition, mortgages on subsidized properties will only
be sold with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections; mortgages
for unsubsidized projects may be sold without FHA insurance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On April 13, 1994, the Department published a proposed rule on the sale of HUD-held multifamily mortgages (59 FR 17500).
Two days earlier, on April 11, 1994, President Clinton approved the Multifamily Property Disposition Reform Act
of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-233) (Multifamily Property Disposition Act). Section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property
Disposition Act revised section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1701z-11)
(HCD Amendments of 1978). This final rule incorporates technical changes to section 203 of the HCD Amendments of 1978,
as amended by section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property Disposition Act, as those provisions affect the sale of HUD-held
mortgages. HUD will be publishing, shortly, an interim rule to implement the statutory amendments affecting the
management and disposition of HUD-owned multifamily projects.


Summary of Comments_Generally


The Department received a total of 11 comments on this proposed rule. The majority of the comments dealt with features
of the Department's planned mortgage sale program rather than with specifics of the proposed rule. However, two commenters
made recommendations regarding the negotiated sale of subsidized mortgages to State and local governments, and
one commenter recommended changes to the proposed rule. All of the comments are discussed in more detail below, and,
when appropriate, are addressed in the text of the rule.
Only the National Housing Law Project (NHLP) focused specifically upon the text of the proposed rule. The NHLP acknowledged
HUD's authority to sell HUD-held mortgages, but urged that ``the utmost care should be taken to ensure that low-income
tenants do not lose benefits to which they are entitled.''
With regard to the sale of subsidized mortgages with insurance, the NHLP stated that: ``The mere act of selling with
insurance will not necessarily by itself satisfy the statutory goal of continuing the protections for each project
that are at least as advantageous as the prior program's.'' The NHLP sought assurance that, at a minimum, the regulatory
protections contained in, for example, the regulatory agreement, note, and program regulations also would apply.

This concern is consistent with the Department's intent to preserve existing tenant protections. Consequently,
the rule has been modified to include statutory language prohibiting the Secretary from selling any mortgages held
by the Secretary on any subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that ensures that the project
will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental
housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under
which the original loan or mortgage was made or insured. In other words, sale of a HUD-held subsidized mortgage will
not affect the existing regulatory agreement, prepayment restrictions, flexible subsidy agreements, rental subsidy
contracts, or other applicable program regulations and housing policies.
The NHLP also sought clarification that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously subsidized projects will
be treated like subsidized mortgages. The Department so intends and has modified the rule to make this evident.
The NHLP requested that a project with any project-based Section 8 assistance be treated as a subsidized project and
be sold with insurance. However, doing so would be contrary to the Multifamily Property Disposition Act. In the Multifamily
Property Disposition Act, Congress revised the definition of a subsidized project for the mortgage sale program
(see section 203(b)(2)). Under the prior law (see section 203(i)(2)), a project that had any rent supplement assisted
units was a subsidized project. The requirement that more than 50 percent of the units had to be assisted for the project
to be a subsidized project applied only to assistance provided under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than
with certificate and voucher assistance). Finally, under the former law for purposes of mortgage sales, any unit
assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than certificate and voucher assistance) made the project
a subsidized project.
Under the new statutory definition of subsidized project, the more than 50 percent of the units provision applies
to all forms of project-based rental assistance listed. Also, there is no longer an exception from the 50 percent requirement
for mortgage sales. Thus, under the new law the definition of ``subsidized project'' is the same for the purpose of
disposing of HUD-owned projects and for mortgage sales.
The definition of ``subsidized project'' in this final rule conforms to the statutory definition of ``subsidized
project.'' Accordingly, projects that are not Section 236, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, or Section 202 projects and have
some units, but not more than 50 percent of the units, assisted with project-based rental assistance are under both
the statute and the rule ``unsubsidized projects.'' However, the Department acknowledges that such partially assisted,
unsubsidized mortgages merit special treatment. Therefore, the Department plans to sell these mortgages in specialized
auctions to investors who will be selected, in part, on the basis of their commitment to preserving the economically
integrated nature of the rental housing.
The NHLP also suggested that unsubsidized projects with affordable rents be treated as though they were subsidized
and be sold with insurance. Adoption of this approach would be inconsistent with congressional direction. Therefore,
the Department must reject this approach. The statute defines ``subsidized project'' as a project that is receiving
assistance: (1) Under the section 221(d)(5) (Below Market Interest Rate) or the section 236 (Interest Reduction
Payments) programs; (2) under the section 202 direct loan program; or (3) in the form of rental assistance for more
than 50 percent of its units under the section 8, section 23, rent supplement or rental assistance payments (``RAP'')
programs. This rule merely adopts the statutory definition of ``subsidized project'' as the regulatory definition.
The NHLP recommended that HUD move certain statements regarding the availability of Section 8 assistance to tenants
in unsubsidized projects from the preamble of the proposed rule to the regulatory text. The statements in the preamble
describe HUD standards which are already addressed in other HUD regulations. As such, there is no need to repeat these
standards in the mortgage sale rule.
The NHLP asked why HUD would not sell mortgages without insurance to mortgagees that are HUD-approved as well as to
mortgagees that are not HUD-approved. In fact, HUD plans to offer the mortgages for sale to both types of mortgagees.
The NHLP also questioned the wisdom of selling mortgages to mortgagees that are not HUD-approved, on the ground that
HUD will have little regulatory leverage over such mortgagees. HUD expects that HUD's relationship with such mortgagees
will be governed by and enforceable under the terms and conditions of the loan sale.
The NHLP recommended that HUD impose certain requirements in the event that a delinquent mortgage is restructured
by a purchaser. Specifically, the NHLP recommended that the purchaser/mortgagor should agree:
(1) Not to discriminate against Certificate and Voucher holders merely because of their status as Certificate or
Voucher holders;
(2) To accept a project-based Section 8 contract if offered, as long as the rents charged at the project are within 120
percent of the Section 8 Fair Market Rents;
(3) To require good cause eviction for all tenants; and
(4) To require that the owner provide good repair and maintenance.
HUD's ability to regulate a mortgage restructuring will depend upon whether the mortgage is subsidized or unsubsidized.
In the case of a delinquent subsidized mortgage, where the mortgage will be insured upon sale, HUD's oversight can
be expected to be close and prescriptive; however, in the case of delinquent unsubsidized mortgages, where the mortgages
will not be insured upon sale, HUD does not expect to regulate a mortgage restructuring closely.

In section 290.202(b) of the proposed rule, HUD stated that: ``Delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: (1) HUD believes
that foreclosure is unavoidable; and (2) the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who
are not receiving housing assistance, but who would receive assistance [under section 203 of the Housing and Community
Development Amendments of 1978] if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage.'' The NHLP recommended that HUD not sell delinquent
unsubsidized mortgages ``if it believes that foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project * * * is
occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but could do so if HUD foreclosed upon the
mortgage.'' HUD has changed this section in the final rule to conform with the new Multifamily Property Disposition
Act. 

Under section 203(a) of the prior law, HUD was directed to preserve as affordable all units in unsubsidized projects
that were occupied by low-income families. This statutory requirement was generally met at foreclosure or sale by
placing project-based Section 8 assistance on units that were occupied by low-income families. Thus, under the prior
law the import of  290.202(b) would have been that, in general, HUD 

would not

 sell unsubsidized projects where foreclosure was unavoidable and there were unassisted low-income tenants in occupancy.


Under the new law, however, HUD is under no obligation when foreclosing or selling an unsubsidized project to provide
Section 8 assistance to low-income tenants if those tenants were not already receiving some form of tenant-based
assistance (see section 203(e)(1)(D)). HUD's only obligation upon foreclosure or sale in this regard (and it applies
only to very low-income families that would have to pay more than 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income for rent,
not to all low-income families) is to ensure that their rent is not increased for two years (see section 203(g)). These
low-income tenants would receive Section 8 assistance only if HUD makes an administrative decision to provide more
Section 8 assistance than is required by statute. Thus, the import of  290.202(b) in the final rule is that HUD
generally 

will

 sell unsubsidized projects where foreclosure was unavoidable and there are unassisted low-income tenants in occupancy.
HUD intends to foreclose delinquent unsubsidized mortgages only if it makes a determination that unassisted tenants
would receive assistance (including assistance available on a discretionary basis) if HUD were to foreclose. 

Finally, the NHLP recommended that HUD not sell delinquent, partially assisted, unsubsidized mortgages facing
foreclosure. As noted above, HUD acknowledges that these mortgages require special treatment, and they will be sold
only under conditions that preserve the rental housing for economically integrated rental use. 



Negotiated Sales to State and Local Agencies 



The National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) and the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) responded
to HUD's request for comments on the negotiated sale of mortgages to State and local agencies authorized by section
203(k)(3) of the Housing and Community Development Act Amendments of 1978. Both strongly supported such sales and
described the unique qualifications that State housing finance agencies (HFAs) have to assist HUD in preserving
the availability and affordability of the projects securing the loans for low- and moderate-income rental use. Specific
comments and HUD's responses are summarized below. 



Subsidy Contracts



NCSHA recommended that HUD assign Section 8 subsidy contract administration to HFAs. HUD is willing to consider this
recommendation, subject to agreement on fees and the concern raised in conjunction with regulatory agreements.




Regulatory Agreements



NCSHA recommended that HUD assign broad regulatory authority to HFAs, including allowing HFAs to set rents and require
owners to enter into HFA management contracts. HUD is concerned that there is no mechanism for restraining costs if
the HFA performs financing and regulatory functions and also administers the Section 8 contract. HUD would like to
explore how to combine regulatory authority with incentives to contain costs. Otherwise it is HUD's view that States
may either administer Section 8 subsidy contracts or regulate rents, but not both, in order to preserve the checks
and balances vital to a sound subsidy system. 



Windfall Profits



NCSHA recommended and HUD concurs that mortgage insurance should be limited to the purchase price of a mortgage or
the unpaid principal balance, whichever is lower. In addition, HUD would not permit resale of mortgages for capital
gains, even if the gains are passed through to HUD. 



Servicing



NCSHA recommended that ``[w]hen an HFA requests it, HUD should turn over servicing functions to it upon its purchase
of the loan.'' HUD intends to turn over mortgage servicing functions upon the sale of a loan in every case. 



Delinquent Loans



NCSHA recommended splitting mortgages into financially viable and inviable portions, with HUD retaining the inviable
portion. HUD does not wish to use this method for restoring a mortgage to financial soundness, because it is inconsistent
with the overall objective of reducing the HUD-held inventory and HUD servicing responsibility. In addition, strategies
that involve owner consent, such as creating new mortgage documents, may add a party to the negotiations and complicate
the transaction. HUD would consider other approaches that meet mutual goals. 



Long-Term Affordability



NCSHA recommended that HUD extend the mortgage insurance period when purchasers negotiate an extension of the affordability
period, so the insurance would be coterminous with the financing. HUD would need more information on what is being
proposed in order to assess this recommendation, e.g. what ``financing'' is being proposed? FHA insurance runs with
the mortgage; any additional insurance period would require careful consideration and review.

Refinancing



NCSHA recommended that HUD permit HFAs to restructure high-interest rate loans through Section 223(a)(7) refinancing.
HUD-held mortgages are not eligible for Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, and subsidized mortgages generally are
not eligible for prepayment. However, as part of the restructuring of the mortgage, HUD will consider modifying mortgages
to lower above-market interest rates (and to reduce subsidy payments, as appropriate) prior to mortgage sale. Such
reduction would be considered in any pricing. 



Due Diligence



NCSHA recommended that HUD work with HFAs to disseminate information on mortgages and permit HFAs to perform adequate
and timely due diligence. HUD intends to cooperate fully with HFAs in their conduct of needed due diligence on the mortgages
in which they are interested. 



Warranties and Representations



NCSHA recommended that, among other representations, HUD warrant and represent that purchased loans are secured
by projects that are in full compliance with their regulatory agreements and subsidy contracts and that the loans
are current in their debt service and escrow and reserve payments. HUD's view is that not all of these representations
and warranties may be appropriate for the subperforming mortgages that are the focus of this negotiated sale program.
HUD proposes to discuss these representations in conjunction with necessary due diligence and a specific portfolio
of mortgages identified for sale. 



Interstate Mortgage Pools



NCSHA recommended consideration of the formation of interstate mortgage pools, to lower administrative burdens
and transaction costs. HUD will consider such pools as long as the results are consistent with the overall objectives
of the negotiated sale program, including hands-on servicing by the purchasing agency. 



Others



In addition, NCSHA and IHDA recommended that HUD negotiate the sale of both unsubsidized mortgages with Section 8
contracts and nonperforming unsubsidized mortgages. As noted above, HUD intends to sell partially assisted, unsubsidized
mortgages in specialized auctions to investors that will be selected in part on the basis of their commitment to preserving
the economically integrated nature of this rental housing. In addition, HUD intends to sell nonperforming unsubsidized
mortgages to the highest bidder in competitive auctions that are designed to put local and national bidders on equal
footing. Given the high degree of investor interest in HUD's unsubsidized mortgage portfolio and the Department's
aim of reducing losses to the FHA insurance fund, the Department cannot justify reserving unsubsidized mortgages
for purchase only by State and local agencies. Depending upon the terms of a sale, however, these agencies may participate
with other investors in the purchase of these mortgages. 



HUD Mortgage Sale Program 



Several comments focused upon the mechanics of HUD's auction program. Both JBS & Associates, Inc., a national
real estate and loan marketing firm, and Ross-Dove Company, Inc., an auctioneering firm, recommended that HUD use
open outcry auctions as one method of disposition to sell multifamily mortgages. HUD will consider the use of open
outcry auctions for some of its mortgage sales. 

The Real Estate Capital Recovery Association (RECRA), a trade association representing both real estate workout
specialists and real estate purchasers, recommended that HUD develop a strategy and schedule for disposing of the
HUD-held inventory; determine the best disposition strategy for mortgages on a case-by-case basis; and make greater
use of the private sector in managing, foreclosing, and selling assets. In addition, RECRA recommended against giving
mortgagors two purchase opportunities_i.e., the opportunity to payoff their mortgages and to bid in an auction.
RECRA believed both: (1) that HUD's ability to negotiate a payoff would be improved if the mortgagor could not participate
in the auction; and (2) that other bidders would not want to bid against the mortgagor who is most knowledgeable about
the property. The terms and conditions under which a mortgagor may be permitted to bid on its mortgage are best decided
in the light of the particular facts of a mortgage sale, such as whether the mortgages are being sold separately or in
pools or are current or delinquent. Accordingly, HUD will announce any such terms and conditions in the mortgage sales
announcement and by notice to affected mortgagors. HUD will consider these comments and other factors in setting
these terms and conditions.

The National Leased Housing Association (NLHA) supported the proposed rule, but believed that it should have gone
further in spelling out the details of HUD's mortgage sale program, in order to provide an opportunity for public comment.
In particular, NLHA wanted more detail regarding the FHA mortgage insurance programs to be used, the minimum bid requirements,
any borrower right of first refusal and right to bid policies, and the nature of the bid process. It recommended that
mortgages be sold individually, bidders have adequate time in which to perform due diligence, and workout agreements
be permitted to be terminated by agreement between the new mortgagee and the mortgagor. All of this advice is well-taken.
The Department has consulted widely, and will continue to consult, in the development of its mortgage sales program,
but does not believe that such details concerning mortgage sale procedures should be codified in regulation. Instead,
the Department intends to adopt mortgage sale policies that are consistent with these regulations and are suited
to the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale. This approach also will allow the Department to learn from
experience and feedback from all affected parties as it pursues a series of mortgage sales. Auction procedures will
be spelled out in a bid package distributed prior to each auction. 

One mortgagor recommended a carefully considered set of policies for mortgage settlements with owners. These recommendations
will be considered as HUD works with its financial advisor to develop a mortgage settlement policy. A law firm urged
special attention to participation by small investors in the mortgage sale program, including negotiated sales
to small investors. HUD seeks to encourage participation by small investors by offering nonperforming mortgages
in small pools; however, it is not authorized to negotiated sales to private entities. A development and property
management firm recommended against the sale of HUD-held mortgages on the ground that they would be too deeply discounted;
however, if they were sold, the firm recommended that the mortgages be sold individually, rather than in pools, to
receive the highest price. HUD will determine whether to offer mortgages individually, in pools, or both, based on
the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale and other terms and conditions of the auction. The Chinese-American
Golden Age Association recommended the sale of Section 202 loans. HUD is considering various options for these mortgages
at the present time. 



Section-by-Section Changes From Proposed Rule 



Some of the provisions in the final rule have been reformatted, to aid in clarity. Substantive changes made to the proposed
rule are identified below: 



Section 207.270 



A new provision has been added to part 207 which authorizes the Department to modify the terms of the mortgage reinsurance
pursuant to section 223(c) of the National Housing Act when the Department sells a mortgage with FHA insurance. This
change is necessary to take into account the fact that mortgages may be sold to investors at a discount rate due to fluctuating
interest rates. When mortgages are sold at a discount rate, HUD will adjust the amount of the reinsurance to reflect
the purchase price of the mortgage, not the original mortgage amount. HUD will determine the amount of the reinsurance
at the time of the mortgage sale. This regulatory change codifies existing Departmental policy for mortgage sales.




Section 290.3



The definition of subsidized mortgage has been clarified to indicate that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously
subsidized projects will be treated like subsidized mortgages. The definition of subsidized project has been conformed
with the Multifamily Property Disposition Act. 


Section 290.200


Language has been added to the section describing the purpose of the new subpart D, Sale of HUD-held mortgages, to state
that, except for negotiated sales to State and local governments, HUD will sell mortgages on a competitive basis.
Language has also been added to explain that the Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage
for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered mortgage from sale. The procedures set out in the remaining sections
of this subpart apply only when the Secretary has determined that a qualifying mortgage is to be sold. 



Section 290.201(a)



The Department agrees with commenters that existing tenant protections should be preserved. Consequently, a paragraph
has been added to include language from section 203(k)(1) of the HCD Amendments of 1978, prohibiting the Secretary
from selling a HUD-held mortgage on a subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that meets certain
qualifications. The transaction must ensure that the project will continue to operate at least until the maturity
date of the loan or mortgage in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing
and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the original mortgage was insured. 



Section 290.202(b)(2)



The language has been changed to incorporate the changes made by the Multifamily Property Disposition Act in the treatment
of unsubsidized projects. 



Other Matters



Executive Order 12866 



This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning
and Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is
available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street
SW, Washington, D.C. 



Environmental Impact 



In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review
under the Order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD administrative procedures, and
do not impinge upon the relationship between Federal government and State and local governments. 



Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and
general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies
or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. This rule will not affect the ability of small entities, relative to larger entities, to bid for and
acquire HUD-held mortgages that HUD decides to sell. 



Justification for Final Rulemaking 



In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish section 207.270 of this rule for effect without first soliciting
public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the Department is merely codifying an existing
earlier policy. 



Regulatory Agenda 



This final rule was listed as sequence number 1579 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20446) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

290.201 Sale of subsidized HUD-held mortgages. 


290.202 Sale of unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. 


Subpart D_Sale of HUD-Held Mortgages 


 290.200 

Purpose and applicability of Civil Rights Requirements. 


(a) 

Purpose.

 The purpose of this subpart is to set out HUD's policy regarding the sale of subsidized and unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages.
Except as otherwise provided in  290.201(b)(ii), the Department will sell mortgages on a competitive basis.
The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered
mortgage from sale. However, when a qualifying mortgage is offered for sale, the procedures set out in this part will
govern the sale. 
(b) 

Applicability of Civil Rights Requirements.

 Nothing in this subpart relieves HUD or housing that receives federal financial assistance from federal civil rights
requirements, including section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11063, and related regulations
and requirements. This includes housing in which less than 50% of the units are receiving housing assistance payments
under either Section 23 or Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and housing in which the rent of any unit
is paid by a Section 8 certificate or voucher. 


 290.201 

Sale of subsidized HUD-held mortgages. 


(a) 

Tenant protections preserved.

 HUD will only sell subsidized mortgages if the sale is part of a transaction that will ensure that the project subject
to the mortgage will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the mortgage, in a manner that will provide
rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program
under which the mortgage was insured prior to its assignment. HUD's policy for selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages
is set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 
(b) 

Current mortgages.

 HUD may sell current mortgages, as follows: 
(1) 

Current mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance

 will be sold either: 
(i) On a competitive basis to FHA-approved mortgagees; or 
(ii) On a negotiated basis, to State or local governments, or to a group of investors that includes an agency of a State
or local government, if: 
(A) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or an agency of the State or local government,
to: 
(

1

) Act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage; and 
(

2

) Ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized
housing program; and 
(B) The sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government while
maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program. 
(2) 

Current mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance

 will be sold if HUD can offer protections equivalent to those listed for an insured sale in paragraph (b)(1) of this
section. 
(c) 

Delinquent mortgages.

 Delinquent mortgages will be sold only if, as part of the sales transaction: 
(1) The mortgages are restructured; and 
(2) Either FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent protections are provided. 


 290.202 

Sale of unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. 


HUD's policy for selling unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: 
(a) 

Current mortgages

 may be sold with or without FHA mortgage insurance. 
(b) 

Delinquent mortgages

 may be sold without FHA mortgage insurance. However, delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: 
(1) HUD believes that foreclosure is unavoidable; and 
(2) The project securing the mortgage is occupied by very low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance
and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA is extending the compliance dates for classification, hazard communication, and packaging requirements of
the Hazardous Materials Regulations applicable to infectious substances, including regulated medical waste.
The extension is intended to provide RSPA with time to evaluate the need for changes to regulatory requirements which
had been scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1994, and to continue coordination with other Federal agencies that
have jurisdiction over infectious substances. The extension is responsive to the concerns of shippers and transporters
that more interagency coordination is needed in order to avoid overlapping or inconsistent Federal requirements
for infectious substances.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On December 21, 1990, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM-181 (55 FR 52402) that comprehensively revised
the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180) with respect to classification, hazard communication,
and packaging requirements of hazardous materials. In Docket HM-181, RSPA adopted standards based on United
Nations (UN) recommendations, including repla
