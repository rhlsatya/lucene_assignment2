ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER







Prices and Availability of Federal Register Publications



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (ACFR).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (Administrative Committee) announces changes to the prices
charged for 

Federal Register

 publications. The price changes apply to annual subscription rates for the daily 

Federal Register

, the Code of Federal Regulations, the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, the monthly Federal Register
Index and monthly LSA (List of CFR Sections Affected), as well as to the single issue price of the daily 

Federal Register

. These price changes are necessary to more accurately reflect the Government's cost of production and distribution
of these publications.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, which establishes prices for Federal Register publications,
has determined that it must make price adjustments to certain 

Federal Register

 publications to accurately reflect costs of production and distribution. Price adjustments apply to subscriptions
and to single issues.



On September 1, 1992, the Administrative Committee announced that it was adopting a policy of full cost recovery to
ensure that revenues from subscriptions and single issue sales would keep pace with increased costs attributable
to printing and labor expenses at the Government Printing Office (GPO) plant and prior postal rate increases (57 FR
40024). The Administrative Committee resolved to adjust prices over a period of several years and to conduct an annual
review to determine the rate of increase necessary to gradually bring prices into alignment with costs. On December
10, 1993, the Administrative Committee further adjusted prices of 

Federal Register

 publications pursuant to the annual pricing review (58 FR 64871).

After reviewing the Government Printing Office's most current analysis of its production and distribution costs,
the Administrative Committee has determined that further incremental increases in the prices to be charged for the
paper editions of 

Federal Register

 publications are necessary to achieve full cost recovery. The increased prices reflected in this final rule are primarily
attributable to labor charges, equipment costs and prospective postal rate increases for second class mail. Changes
to prices of the microfiche editions of the 

Federal Register

 and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) are also included in this final rule. Production of the microfiche editions
of these publications is subject to a competitive bidding process that determines the prices to be charged. While
overall subscription prices for microfiche copies have increased, prices of individual copies have decreased or
remained the same.

The following rates are effective as of October 26, 1994. The annual subscription rates for the 

Federal Register

 paper edition are increased to $494, or $544 for a combined 

Federal Register

, Federal Register Index and LSA (List of CFR Section Affected) subscription. The annual subscription price of the
microfiche edition of the 

Federal Register

, including the Federal Register Index and LSA, is increased to $433. The price for single copies of the daily 

Federal Register

 is increased to $8 for the paper edition. The annual subscription price for the Federal Register Index is increased
to $24. The annual subscription price for the monthly LSA is increased to $26. The annual subscription rates for the
Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents are increased to $75 by non-priority mail, or $132 by first-class mail.
The price of an individual copy is increased to $3.

As of January 1, 1994, the annual subscription rates for a full set of the Code of Federal Regulations are increased
to $883 for the paper edition and $264 for the microfiche edition. The price of a single volume in microfiche form is
reduced to $1.

In the 1992 and 1993 price change rule documents, the Administrative Committee invited public comment on the pricing
structure of Federal Register publications. Three comments were received regarding the December 10, 1993 rule.
Two commenters inquired whether unofficial Federal Register data formerly available as ACFR publications on magnetic
tape would instead be distributed under the auspices of the Superintendent of Documents. This unofficial Federal
Register data derived from the printing data base remains available for purchase from GPO in compressed diskette
form as a GPO reproducible product under the authority of 44 U.S.C. chapter 17. One commenter inquired about implementation
of the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (GPO Access), 44 U.S.C.
4101, and asked when the official online edition of the 

Federal Register

 would be available and how much it would cost to subscribe. The online 

Federal Register

, including full text and graphics, began daily service on the GPO Access System's Wide Area Information Server (WAIS)
via the Internet on June 8, 1994. Subscription information is contained on page II of the daily 

Federal Register

 or by telnet to wais.access.gpo.gov (log in as newuser (all lower case); no password is required). Dial-up users (SWAIS
service) should use communications software and modem to obtain subscription information at 202-512-1661
(log in as wais (all lower case); no password is required). Complete price schedules, including discounts for multiple
workstations, are available by calling GPO at 202-512-1530 or by fax at 202-512-1262. Prices
are subject to continuous review and will be adjusted periodically based upon GPO's calculation of the incremental
cost of dissemination.
In addition to the price changes contained in this document, the Administrative Committee is updating  11.2
to reflect the availability of the online 

Federal Register

. The Committee has granted authority to the Superintendent of Documents to price the online 

Federal Register

 for the first six months of operation to allow GPO to collect actual cost data. The Administrative Committee continues
to welcome comments on Federal Register publications and prices.
The Administrative Committee has determined that publication of a proposed rule is unnecessary. The Administrative
Committee has authority under 44 U.S.C. 1506 to set the prices to be charged for 

Federal Register

 subscriptions and individual copies. To the extent possible, the Administrative Committee sets prices to recover
only the actual cost of producing and distributing Federal Register publications. The revised prices are based on
an in-depth cost study conducted for the Administrative Committee by the Government Printing Office. Because only
actual costs were considered in setting the revised price schedule based on an in-depth cost study, the Administrative
Committee has determined that there is good cause for promulgating this final rule without a prior notice of proposed
rulemaking as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).
This regulatory action has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, under Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.) does not apply to rate increases necessary to recover the costs to the Government of printing and distributing these
publications.

Interstate Movement of Carambola from Hawaii 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are allowing the fruit of carambola to be moved interstate from Hawaii. As a condition of movement, the fruit of carambola
must undergo prescribed treatment for fruit flies under the supervision of an inspector of Plant Protection and Quarantine,
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This action allows the interstate movement from Hawaii of this fruit
while continuing to provide protection against the spread of injurious plant pests from Hawaii to other parts of the
United States. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Hawaiian Fruits and Vegetable regulations (contained in 7 CFR 318.13 through 318.13-17 and referred to
below as the regulations) govern the movement of raw and unprocessed fruits and vegetables, cut flowers, rice straw,
mango seeds, and cactus plants and cactus parts, from Hawaii into or through the continental United States, Guam,
the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, or any other territory or possession
of the United States. Under the regulations, any such movement is defined as ``interstate movement.'' 

Of the articles governed by the regulations, some are absolutely prohibited interstate movement. Others are prohibited
such movement if they fail to meet certain qualifying criteria. Before the effective date of this final rule, the interstate
movement of carambola from Hawaii was prohibited because of the risk that it could spread injurious insects from Hawaii
to other parts of the United States. 

On March 21, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 13256-13257, Docket No. 93-118-1) a proposal to allow the fruit of carambola (

Averrhoa carambola

) to be moved interstate from Hawaii under specified conditions. One of the proposed conditions for interstate movement
was that the fruit be treated with a specified cold treatment. This treatment has been determined to be effective against
the insects in Hawaii that attack carambola_i.e., the Mediterranean fruit fly (

Ceratitis capitata

), the melon fly (

Bactrocera cucurbitae

), and the Oriental fruit fly (

Bactrocera dorsalis

). 

We solicited comments concerning our proposed rule for 60 days ending 
May 20, 1994. We received six comments by that date. The comments were from a municipality in Hawaii, an agricultural
association, and other members of the public. 

Five of the commenters supported the proposal as written. One commenter expressed concerns regarding the testing
done on the prescribed treatment. We discuss below each of the issues raised by the commenter. 

The commenter stated that it appeared that the research done to test a cold treatment against insect pests of carambola
did not include phytotoxicity tests, or the impact of the proposed treatment upon the quality of Hawaiian carambola.
We are making no changes based on this comment. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
conducted tests on a preliminary basis in conjunction with the Hawaii carambola industry to determine whether the
fruit would tolerate the proposed cold treatment. Fruit of carambola was stored at 1.1

#

0.6 

o

C for 12 days. No adverse impact on fruit quality or marketability was observed, which follows the trend of previous
observations by Campbell,

1

 Campbell 

et al.

,

2

 and Miller 

et al.

,

3

 showing that the fruit of carambola tends to tolerate refrigeration relatively well. 







Notwithstanding the tests discussed above, it should be emphasized that all quarantine treatments may affect fruit
quality in some way. For this reason, the APHIS Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual, which is incorporated
by reference into the regulations at 7 CFR 300.1, states that all treatments are applied at the importer's risk, and
that PPQ cannot be held responsible for loss or damage as a result of any prescribed treatments. 

The commenter also stated that the study did not specify the cultivar of fruit used for testing. According to the commenter,
sweet and tart varieties of carambola may have very different host characteristics, and fruit size may have an impact
upon the application of the treatment. We are making no changes based on this comment. In its cold treatment tests,
ARS used both ``sweet'' and ``tart'' cultivars. Nel showed that temperatures and exposure times required to disinfest
Mediterranean fruit fly from different host fruits remained constant regardless of host fruit.

4

 This ``generic'' approach to cold treatments has been accepted for other fruit fly species, including Mexican fruit
fly, 

A. ludens

 (Loew), and Queensland fruit fly, 

Bactrocera tryoni

 Froggatt.





With regard to the effect of fruit size on cold treatment application, ARS made the same observation as Gould and Sharp,
who concluded that ``* * * in terms of total treatment time, there is a small difference in cool-down
time between a large and a small carambola.''

5

 In other words, fruit size is not an important consideration in treatment application. Additionally, APHIS closely
regulates treatments by means of temperature-monitoring devices, and the treatment time is not considered to have
begun until the fruit has reached the required treatment temperature. 





The commenter stated that the artificial infestation procedure used in the study may have placed stress on the fruit
fly larvae, making them more susceptible to cold than would be wild flies in a natural infestation. According to the
commenter, the large number of larvae artificially raised on the small amount of fruit used in the study could have
produced overcrowding effects not representative of field conditions.

<TEXT>
 

We are making no changes based on these comments. Because of the difficulty in obtaining infestation through adult
oviposition, ARS turned to artificial infestation methods. The most successful artificial infestation method
used by ARS did not attempt to rear the insects on carambola, except during the cold treatment period, during which
eggs and larvae were reared on both treated and control carambola. Following the treatment period, the eggs and larvae
were removed from both the treated and control carambola and were placed onto a moist larval diet. This significantly
increased survival of eggs and larvae from the controls, and provided optimum conditions for survival to occur among
the treated eggs and larvae. This method biased the tests toward the insects' survival, rather than toward mortality.


With regard to the commenter's statement regarding the number of fruit flies raised on carambola, ARS concluded that
the effects of the treatment could not be attributed to infestation load. ARS reported that, although the results
were erratic, occasional large numbers of fruit flies, greatly exceeding the ``normal'' field infestations, were
reared from artificially infested carambola controls. From this, ARS concluded that the effects of the treatment
could not be attributed to infestation load. ARS indicated that it chose the optimum infestation methods that provided
insect recovery while testing the quarantine security limits of the treatment. 

The commenter also stated that field populations of flies might naturally be better adapted to surviving the cold
than the laboratory-reared flies used. We are making no changes based on this comment. ARS concluded that there is
no evidence that fruit flies from different elevations in Hawaii respond differently to cold treatments. According
to ARS, this is consistent with previous testing that revealed no evidence that Caribbean fruit flies from their northernmost
range in Florida respond differently to cold treatments of carambola. 

The commenter also stated that, although the tested treatment satisfied statistical security requirements, the
fact that some fruit flies survived the treatment might indicate an unacceptable risk when the treatment is applied
on a commercial scale. We are making no changes based on this comment. The data provided by ARS indicates that ``probit
9'' security (at least 99.968 percent insect mortality rate) was obtained by storage of carambola at 1.1

#

0.6 




C for 12 days. 



Effective Date 



This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. The shipping season for carambola from Hawaii is imminent. Making this
rule effective immediately will allow interested producers and others in the marketing chain to benefit during this
year's shipping season. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined
that this rule should be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 

We are allowing the fruit of carambola to move from Hawaii to other parts of the United States, under safeguards to prevent
the introduction of injurious plant pests from Hawaii. 

At present, there are approximately 5 to 10 farms in Hawaii that produce commercial quantities of carambola. These
farms are small, family-owned, operations. 

This rule will provide Hawaiian producers with access to markets in other parts of the United States. We estimate that
approximately 1,500 to 3,000 pounds of fresh carambola fruit might be shipped from Hawaii to other parts of the United
States annually. These shipments would have an estimated annual market value of between $3,000 and $9,800, depending
on market prices. This represents less than .0002 percent of total Hawaiian agricultural production. The average
annual market value of Hawaiian agricultural products totals about $600 million. 

Small shippers of Hawaiian fruits and vegetables may also receive some benefits from this rule. We estimate that between
10 and 15 small entities will be able to increase marginally the volume of products shipped to other parts of the United
States. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations regarding inspection and handling of livestock for exportation to provide that United
States origin health certificates include all test results, certifications, or other statements required by the
foreign country of destination. This action is necessary to ensure that the origin health certificate contains all
of the information required by the foreign country of destination. We are also amending the requirements concerning
scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export. This action clarifies the regulations and makes the terminology
used in the export regulations consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations. We are also revising
one definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those regulations consistent with
each other.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. 
On May 13, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 24979-24982, Docket No. 93-070-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by providing that United
States origin health certificates include all test results, certifications, or other statements required by the
foreign country of destination. We also proposed to amend the requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats
intended for export, in order to clarify the regulations and make the terminology used in the export regulations consistent
with that used in the domestic scrapie regulations. Additionally, we proposed to revise a definition in the domestic
scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those regulations consistent with each other. 
We solicited comments concerning the proposed rule for a 60-day comment period ending July 12, 1994. The one comment
we received by that date supported the proposal as written. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604, we have performed a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact of
this rule on small entities. 
This rule requires that the origin health certificate required for animals exported from the United States include
any test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country of destination. It also revises
the export regulations in 9 CFR part 91 to make them consistent with the regulations in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79 regarding
the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program. 
No issues were raised by public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis we published
in our proposal, and we identified no significant alternatives to this rule. We anticipate that the changes involving
certification will have little or no impact on domestic exporters. In order for exporters to sell their animals abroad,
the animals must meet the import requirements of the country of destination. Therefore, it is in the exporter's interest
to ensure that those requirements are met. This rule change requires only that the origin health certificate include
all test results, certifications, or other statements required by the country of destination. However, estimates
of the number of animals and the number of small entities that will be affected, and the potential costs to exporters,
are not available. 
The changes to the regulations concerning sheep and goats with regard to scrapie will affect some producers. Under
the regulations, sheep and goats from ``source flock'' premises may not be exported. Under the regulations prior
to the effective date of this rule, source flock premises are considered those from which an animal affected with scrapie
was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie. Under this rule, the export of sheep and goats from
source flocks continues to be prohibited, but the meaning of source flock is revised to mean a flock in which at least
two animals were diagnosed as scrapie-positive animals at an age of 54 months or less, provided the second diagnosis
was made within 60 months of the first, and provided the requirements of a flock plan have not been completed. This change
makes the regulations more restrictive, and may increase the number of animals prohibited exportation because they
originated in a source flock. However, as of July 1993, there were only five source flocks in the United States. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and 
(3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 0579-0020.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>










Specific Licensing of Exports of Certain Alpha-Emitting Radionuclides and Byproduct Material 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to establish specific licensing controls on
the export of bulk tritium, transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, curium-245,
curium-247, and certain specified alpha-emitting radionuclides; revise and establish new general licenses for
tritium and the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides which are keyed to the recipient country's membership in
the Nuclear Suppliers Group; remove Argentina, Brazil, and Chile from the list of restricted destinations; and revise
the general license for exports of Canadian-origin uranium. The amendments are necessary to conform the export controls
of the United States to international export control guidelines and a treaty obligation of the U.S. under the U.S.-Canada
Agreement for Cooperation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On March 17, 1993 (58 FR 14344), the NRC published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule that would amend NRC's regulations in 10 CFR Part 110 pertaining to the export of nuclear material and
equipment. The proposed amendments would revoke the current general licenses for bulk tritium and alpha-emitting
radionuclides having an alpha half-life of 10 days or greater but less than 200 years to conform NRC's regulations
to the export control guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for nuclear-related, dual-use items contained
in IAEA INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2 and approved in 1992.

1

 The alpha-emitting radionuclides subject to this rule are plutonium-236, plutonium-238, thorium-227, thorium-228,
uranium-230, uranium-232, actinium-225, actinium-227, californium-248, californium-250, californium-252,
curium-240, curium-241, curium-242, curium-243, curium-244, einsteinium-252, einsteinium-253, einsteinium-254,
einsteinium-255, fermium-257, gadolinium-148, mendelevium-258, polonium-208, polonium-209, polonium-210,
and radium-223 (specified alpha-emitting radionuclides). Consistent with the NSG guidelines, new general licenses
would be established to permit the export of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides and dispersed tritium to
countries which are members of the NSG dual-use guidelines and to permit the export of the specified alpha-emitting
radionuclides to most other countries when in a device, or a source for use in a device, containing less than 100 millicuries
(3.7 GBq) of alpha activity per device (10 CFR part 71, appendix A, provides specific activities in curies per gram).






The current general license for source material in  110.22(b) would be revised to reduce the annual limit of
Canadian-origin natural uranium that can be exported to any single country from 1,000 kilograms to 500 kilograms
to help assure U.S. compliance with provisions of the U.S.-Canada Agreement for Cooperation. 

The current general licenses for transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, curium-245,
and curium-247 would be revoked to conform NRC's regulations to the International Atomic Energy List of the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). Although COCOM was dissolved in March 1994, the NRC is placing
specific licensing controls on these isotopes because the U.S. and other COCOM member countries agreed to retain
export controls on the existing COCOM list of items. Steps are now being taken by former COCOM member countries to propose
that the NSG control most, if not all, of the nuclear commodities on the COCOM list. 

The proposed amendment to restructure Appendix A, which describes the nuclear reactor equipment subject to NRC licensing
authority, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking proceeding.

The Commission received six letters commenting on the proposed rule. Copies of the letters are available for public
inspection and copying for a fee at the Commission's Public Document Room, located at 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level),
Washington, DC. Five of the letters, two of which were from the same company, came from U.S. manufacturers that utilize
sources containing the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides. These commenters strongly objected to the revocation
of the general licenses for the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides, particularly californium-252 (Cf-252).
The commenters indicated that the specific licensing requirements could result in serious economic disadvantage
to their export business. It is their view that specific licenses would be disruptive to their businesses and cause
them to lose potential business because of the higher expenses of license application fees, the additional paperwork
burden, time delays, and uncertainties in delivery. One commenter believed the current general license regulations
in Part 40 provided sufficient documentation to identify the supplier, quantity exported, and end user/end use.
Several commenters argued that the revisions were unnecessary and were without any benefit to the stated objective
of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
In view of these adverse comments, the NRC asked the companies to provide specific sales data on their exports to better
understand the implications of the new regulation. After reviewing the responses, the NRC continues to believe that
the economic impact on these companies is not significant because of the steps we have taken to address their concerns.
First, the new general licenses permit the export of the specified alpha-emitters in quantities up to 100 millicuries
to most countries, even when they are shipped separately from the equipment in which they are to be used. This understanding,
in itself, reduced much of their concerns. The final rule was revised to clarify this point. Other new general licenses
permit the export of unlimited quantities (except as limited by existing general licenses) of the specified alpha-emitting
radionuclides to NSG member countries. These new general licenses will allow the companies to export a significant
quantity of their Cf-252 sources, including replenishment sources, without obtaining specific licenses. Also
the companies are encouraged to apply for broad, long-term licenses to export their Cf-252 sources. These kinds of
applications could include customers in a number of friendly, non-NSG countries and in sufficient quantities to
cover replenishment sources for six years. 
Several commenters questioned whether a source containing less than 100 millicuries (186 micrograms) of Cf-252,
if shipped separately from the device in which it is to be used, could be exported under the proposed new general license.
One commenter noted that in the NRC materials licensing regulations, a ``source'' is not defined as a ``device''.
As stated above, the NRC considers, for the purpose of part 110, that the export of a Cf-252 source for use in a specified
device qualifies for this general license. The new general licenses are revised to clarify this point. 
One commenter requested that the effective date of the rule be delayed or that exports under contract be exempted by
a ``grandfather'' clause to avoid possible forced defaults in currently existing contracts that are now subject
to specific licensing controls. In response to this concern, the effective date of this rule is 45 days after publication.
This should be sufficient time for exports that are ``in process'' to be accomplished without default. The NRC did
not consider a ``grandfather'' clause in the rule to cover committed contracts. One commenter has committed contracts
to deliver Cf-252 sources to the year 1997. The NRC believes these sources should not be excluded from the new regulation
for more than another few weeks. The applicable export control guidelines were agreed to by the U.S. and other NSG member
countries in 1992 and should be implemented by the NRC without an extended delay. 
A commenter representing a major U.S. vendor stated that the proposed restructuring of Appendix A and the new language
still did not clearly delineate which minor reactor components required NRC licenses and which fall within the jurisdiction
of the Department of Commerce. The commenter believed that the proposed amendment could result in increased confusion
for exporters. In view of this comment, the Commission defers consideration of the revision of Appendix A to a future
rulemaking. 
The same commenter was concerned that service tooling contaminated with residual byproduct, source, or special
nuclear material may be subject to specific licensing controls under the proposed rule. It is not the intent of the
NRC to place new controls on these types of nuclear materials in this rulemaking. 



III. The Final Rule 


Under current NRC regulations, bulk tritium in quantities up to 100 curies, the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides
in unlimited quantities, and transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, and curium-245
in unlimited quantities can be exported to most countries under general licenses. The final rule amends the general
license provisions in 
  110.21-110.23 for the export of special nuclear, source, and byproduct material to revoke the
general licenses for these materials. Specific licensing controls are established on the above materials. Although
some of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides inadvertently were not specifically identified in the proposed
rule, they are included in the general license revocation implemented by this rule. 
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are removed from the list of restricted destinations in  110.29. Since publication
of the proposed rule, Argentina and Brazil have ratified and begun implementation of the Argentina/Brazil/IAEA
full-scope safeguards agreement and Chile has waived into force the Treaty of Tlatelolco. 
Section 110.30 is a list of the other member countries of the NSG. Exports of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides
in unlimited quantities (except as limited by the existing general licenses) and dispersed tritium in quantities
up to 40 curies per device are permitted to NSG member countries under the new general licenses established for them.
Subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule, Argentina has become a member of the NSG and is included in the list.

Three items covered in this final rule were not specifically identified in the proposed rule: (1) The general licenses
in  110.23 for einsteinium-252 -253 -254 -255, fermium-257, gadolinium-148, and mendelevium-258 are revoked;
(2) Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are removed from the restricted destination list in  110.29; and (3) Argentina
is added to the NSG member list in 
 110.30. Although the NRC did not publish these changes for comment in the proposed rule, the NRC is merely codifying
international obligations of the United States. The NRC is proceeding to final rule because these changes involve
a foreign affairs function of the United States. Therefore, solicitation of public comment is not required under
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)) and 10 CFR 110.132(e) and 110.134. Here solicitation of public
comments would delay U.S. conformance with its international obligations and therefore would not be in the public
interest. 


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described as a categorical exclusion under 10 CFR 51.22
(c)(1) and (c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been
prepared for this final rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers
3150-0036 and 3150-0027. 
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average less than 3 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (T-6F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to
the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0036, 3150-0027),
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Regulatory Analysis 



See the discussion in the Regulatory Flexibility Certification for the final regulatory analysis for this rule.



Regulatory Flexibility Certification 


As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule does not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
Based on the information available to the Commission at the time the proposed rule was published, the Commission previously
certified that the proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The information to support this was obtained from the Department of Energy's national laboratories
and some industry sources. The Commission also invited any small entity that determined that it is likely to bear a
disproportionate economic impact because of its size to notify the Commission. 
The Commission received four comments on the proposed rule from U.S. manufacturers that utilize radioactive sources
containing Cf-252. Two of the companies qualify as small entities. Through their comments, the Commission
became aware of the potentially detrimental economic impact that the revocation of the general licenses under which
they were permitted to export Cf-252 would have. In view of these adverse comments, the NRC asked the companies
to provide sales data on their exports to better reflect the implications of the new regulation. Based on a review of
this summary data, the NRC, in cooperation with the companies, found that the impact of the rule changes on future sales
will be much less than they had feared. 
First, new general licenses are established to permit the export of 
CF-252 sources in quantities up to 100 millicuries to most countries, even when they are shipped separately
from the equipment in which they are to be used. This understanding, in itself, reduces much of their concerns. Further,
other new general licenses are established to permit the export of unlimited quantities (except as limited by existing
general licenses) of Cf-252 sources to NSG member countries. These new general licenses will allow the companies
to export a significant quantity of their Cf-252 sources, including replenishment sources, without obtaining
specific licenses. In addition, the companies may submit broad, long-term licenses to export their Cf-252
sources to their medical, scientific, industrial, and reactor-related customers in friendly, non-NSG countries,
thereby eliminating case-by-case review. Such licenses could authorize exports of Cf-252 sources in sufficient
quantities to cover startup sources and replenishment sources for Taiwan and South Korean power reactors for a number
of years. The anticipated value of the exports under such licenses would range from $260,000 to over $2 million. Other
such licenses could authorize exports of Cf-252 sources and replenishment sources to medical, industrial,
and scientific customers, with total export values under such licenses ranging from $100,000 to over $500,000. The
current fee would be $1300 for each specific license application submitted. These steps will greatly reduce the financial
burden of the license application fees and the additional paperwork. The processing of an export license application
of this type normally takes less than 45 days for final action. The annual burden imposed by the rule is estimated to
average less than 3 hours for an exporter for each specific application. The staff expects less than ten new applications
a year as a result of this rule. 
As an additional step to address the concerns of the exporters, the NRC consulted with the Department of Energy technical
specialists to determine if any adjustments could be made to the proposed amendments for the specified alpha-emitting
radionuclides, particularly Cf-252, to lessen the burden on U.S. exporters that export these materials to
non-NSG member countries (exports to NSG countries would still be under general licenses). However, no acceptable
adjustments were identified. We confirmed with U.S. nuclear weapons design experts that all of the specified alpha-emitting
radionuclides, including Cf-252, could have some utility in nuclear explosive devices and that the 100 millicurie
threshold for control was appropriate for the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides. 
There are no alternatives for achieving the stated objective. This rule is necessary to conform NRC's export controls
to the international export guidelines of the NSG. The United States and other NSG member countries have formally
agreed to control these materials because of their utility in nuclear explosive weapons. Thus, the regulation is
required to satisfy an international obligation of the United States. The foregoing discussion constitutes the
regulatory flexibility analysis and the regulatory analysis for this final rule.

Fee for Expedited Passport Processing 



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Interim final rule with request for comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This rule amends the Schedule of Consular Fees and the passport regulations to reflect that an additional fee will
be charged within the United States for expediting the processing of passports. The service will be provided upon
payment of the fee when requested by the applicant and justified by urgent departure plans.



The rule establishes what service is provided for the fee; establishes when the fee will be charged; sets the amount
of the fee; establishes the documentation the applicant will need to present to obtain the service; defines the limited
situations when the fee will not be charged; provides for a refund when expedited services cannot be given; and provides
that the after hours surcharge for consular services will not be charged within the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

On August 26, 1994, the President signed into law Public Law 103-317, the Department of State and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1995. The Diplomatic and Consular Programs appropriation in this Act provides that ``all receipts
received from a new charge from expedited passport processing'' shall, in effect, be retained by the Department of
State in the ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs account'' and available until expended. See S. Rept. 103-309,
at 123 (July 14, 1994).



To utilize this new fee retention authority consistent with congressional intent, the Department of State is, in
this rule, establishing a new fee for expedited passport processing. The Department already has specific authority
to establish passport fees under 22 U.S.C. 214, as amended (which normally requires that fees be collected into the
U.S. Treasury). The Department also is authorized to establish fees for passport related services under 31 U.S.C.
9701, a reference to which is being added to the authorities section of 22 CFR part 51.

Public Law 103-317 authorizes the Department to retain the new fee for expedited passport processing.

The Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, 22 CFR 22.1 is amended to add Item 14, Passport Expedite Fee and to limit
the application of the after hours fee, Item 93, to posts abroad. The after-hours fee has been used domestically only
in cases where passport agencies were open after hours to process urgent passport requests. These costs will now be
subsumed in the expedited processing fee. 22 CFR part 51 is amended to add section 51.67 to provide for the expedited
processing of a passport within the United States upon payment of the passport expedite fee. Section 51.64(f) is added
to provide for a refund of the expedite fee when the expedited service is not, in fact, provided.

The new fee will be in addition to any other applicable fee. The expedite fee will not cover the cost of urgent mailing
fees, if required.

<DOCNO> FR940926-0-00016 </DOCNO>

The new fee is being set at $30.00, consistent with the Department's consultations with Congress before Public Law
103-317 was enacted. This fee will ensure that the costs of processing passports on an expedited basis, as reflected
in the Department's 1991 consular fees cost study, are borne by those who receive that service and that the Department
recovers additional costs associated with implementing this fee and eliminating the separate charge for overtime
work. (As noted by Congress, for example, up to 60% more time is required to process a passport application on an expedited
basis than to provide normal processing services.)

If expedited processing is granted, the Department, through the Passport Agencies, will undertake to process the
passport within three business days. The expedited service covered by the new fee begins when the application is received
by a Passport Agency through personal delivery; by mail; or, if the application is already at an Agency, when the request
to expedite is approved. If the applicant's planned departure is within fewer than three days, the Passport Agency
may be able to accommodate this shorter period.

There will be situations in which expedited passport processing cannot be completed within three days. Such circumstances
could include cases in which the applicant does not submit adequate documentation; the applicant is the subject of
an unresolved civil or criminal law enforcement matter; or, passport equipment breaks down. The Department expects
that these situations will be very rare. In such circumstances, the applicant will be notified and the fee will be refunded.

The rule provides for waiver of the expedite fee in cases where the need for expedited processing results from a mistake
by the Department in processing the application. No waiver of the fee will otherwise be made.

To ensure that expedited processing is used only by those who have urgent travel plans, the regulation requires a person
requesting this service to provide confirmed tickets or an itinerary showing his or her imminent departure in less
than ten days or showing special visa needs.

This rule takes effect on October 1, 1994, the beginning of Fiscal Year 1995, the fiscal year covered by Public Law 103-317.
The implementation of this rule as an interim final rule with provision for post-promulgation comments is based upon
the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3). Delay in implementing this provision
of Public Law 103-317 would be contrary to congressional expectations that the Department will begin collection
of this fee at the beginning of FY 1995.

This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule does not impose information collection requirements under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required by E.O. 12778 and certified
to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed internally by
the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof.

Collection From Third Party Payers of Reasonable Costs of Healthcare Services



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule replaces the current method of per diem billings to one based on diagnostic related groups, expands
the single outpatient billing category to as many as sixty, and expands the billing for outpatient services to include
land ambulance service, air ambulance service and hyperbaric services. This final rule improves billing methods
for both inpatient and outpatient care. This expansion creates a greater level of specificity which more accurately
reflects the cost of the care provided. In addition, this final rule identifies additional outpatient services for
which recovery of costs will be sought.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. 1095 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-272,
 2001(a)(1), to permit the Department of Defense to collect from third party payers reasonable inpatient hospital
care costs incurred on behalf of most DoD health care beneficiaries. To implement this statute, the Department of
Defense issued a proposed rule October 8, 1986, and a final rule September 25, 1987. The final rule has been amended
several times since 1987, most recently on September 9, 1992, (57 CFR 41096). That rule changed the unified per diem
rate for inpatient care to a set of 12 clinical group per diem rates. It also implemented authority to bill for outpatient
services by establishing a single per visit rate for most outpatient services.



II. Provisions of the Final Rule


A. Inpatient Services



In October 1992, the Department of Defense began a transition from the traditional single rate for reimbursement
for various healthcare services to multiple rates reflective of the clinical care provided. The multiple rates result
in charges that more closely approximate the actual costs of delivering specific categories of medical services,
such as surgical care, obstetrical care, pediatric care, etc. The rates are based on the actual costs of rendering
healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS).

<TEXT>
 

This rule changes paragraph 220.8(c) by replacing the current twelve billing categories with a billing method based
on diagnostic related groups (DRGs), as specifically authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3). The DRG-based method for
determining reasonable costs of inpatient care will produce more accurate and equitable billings. Billings will
more accurately reflect the costs associated with the actual services provided. This rule models the DRG-based cost
methodology, the basis for the DRG-based payment system for hospital care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program
of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). However, in some respects, this rule simplifies CHAMPUS methods, with authority
to introduce the additional refinements at a later date.

For example, initially this rule uses a single national standardized amount, rather than the three standardized
amounts (large urban, other urban, and rural) used by CHAMPUS. The three amounts do not differ significantly and are
probably not as relevant in connection with a unified federal hospital system, such as DoD's. However, the rule allows
us to adopt the multiple standardized amounts at a later date.

The standardized amount is the result of dividing total system-wide costs of inpatient care by the total number of
discharges system-wide. With respect to DRG relative weights, this rule uses the same weights as are used for the CHAMPUS
DRG-based payment method. The CHAMPUS weights were calculated from a data base of actual CHAMPUS claims filed by civilian
hospitals. Because the patient population under military treatment facilities and CHAMPUS are quite similar, we
believe it is appropriate to use the same weights.

The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment method uses a number of adjustments to the product of standardized amount multiplied
by the relative weight of the appropriate DRG. The adjustments relate to outlier cases, area wage differences and
indirect medical education. Initially, this rule does not use these adjustments, but allows all related costs to
be reflected in the standardized amount. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and predictability for payers.
However, the final rule allows these adjustments to be introduced at a later date.

In accordance with current practice, the standard DRG-based rate is divided into two categories: Hospital charges,
which includes ancillary charges, and Professional charges.

The effective date for implementation of a multiple rate schedule will be the effective date of this rule, barring
unforeseen difficulties in automation support. The specific rates will be published in the 

Federal Register

.



B. Outpatient Services



As with the inpatient rates, the outpatient rates are based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services as
reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS). MEPRS is the standard expense reporting
system for all fixed medical treatment facilities (MTFs) within the Department of Defense (DoD) and is the accepted
source of healthcare information for Congress and offices and agencies of the Executive Branch. The reimbursement
categories are selected based on board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical
accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American
Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS).

Rates are established but need not be limited to each of the following clinical reimbursement categories: Internal
Medicine, Allergy, Cardiology, Diabetic, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Hypertension, Nephrology,
Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Pulmonary Disease, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Infectious Disease, Physical
Medicine, General Surgery, Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Organ Transplant,
Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Proctology, Urology, Pediatric Surgery, Family Planning, Obstetrics, Gynecology,
Pediatrics, Adolescent Pediatrics, Well Baby, Orthopaedics, Cast, Orthotic Laboratory, Hand Surgery, Podiatry,
Psychiatry, Psychology, Child Guidance, Mental Health, Social Work, Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Family Practice,
and Occupational and Physical Therapy. This rule does not necessarily establish a separate rate for each of these
clinical reimbursement categories. Similar categories may be combined for purposes of billing.

Another revision to section 220.8 involves the expansion of a single outpatient rate to multiple reimbursement category
rates similar to that for inpatient care. The Department of Defense adopts a methodology for computing rates for outpatient
care similar to that used for computing multiple rates for inpatient care. Thus, collections for most outpatient
services will be based on a standard per visit fee to a specialty/subspecialty which is representative of the average
cost in facilities of the Uniformed Services of an outpatient visit to that specialty clinic. Multiple outpatient
visits on the same day to different clinics will result in one charge for each clinic visit. Multiple visits on the same
day to the same clinic will result in only one charge. As a general rule, each standard per visit amount to the specialty/subspecialty
clinic will be all-inclusive. No additional charge will be made for routine laboratory, radiology, pharmacy or other
ancillary or overhead services provided in conjunction with an outpatient visit.
Although most outpatient services will be billed based on the standard per visit fee for a specialty/subspecialty,
there are several special rules for particular types of care. One special rule is that a separate charge for same day/ambulatory
surgery will be published annually.
The effective date of the expanded number of billing categories is targeted for October 1, 1994. The specific rates
will be published in the 

Federal Register.




C. Miscellaneous Healthcare Services


Initial implementation of the Third Party Collection Program was somewhat limited in scope and concentrated on inpatient
and ambulatory care areas. This final rule expands the program to include outpatient services which may not traditionally
be provided in hospitals or which are not traditional clinical specialties or subspecialties. This includes, but
is not limited to, ambulance service, hyperbaric treatments, dental care services and immunizations. We intend
to recover the cost of these services to the extent they are generally applicable coverage provisions of a third party
payer.
We intend to recover the cost of ambulance service which includes the cost of providing emergency aid and then transportation
of beneficiaries to a medical treatment facility. It would also include the transport of patients to other medical
facilities or to specialized clinics for diagnostic or therapeutic services which is frequently necessary. We intend
to recover costs on the basis of the length of time the ambulance is in service with one hour to be the minimum amount billed.
The reimbursement rates for ambulance care will only cover the costs of operating the vehicle, including labor costs
(driver and attendant), supplies, fuel, and overhead.

<TEXT>
 

We intend to recover the cost of hyperbaric treatments provided to beneficiaries as part of a course of treatment.
For example, high pressure oxygenation treatments, burn treatments and decompression treatments in response to
diving incidents are frequently provided. We only intend to recover the cost of providing these treatments which
includes the operating cost of the chamber, i.e., labor costs, (operators and attending medical personnel), supplies,
and overhead. We do not intend to include amortization of either the actual or replacement cost of the hyperbaric chamber
or the building.

Dental services are provided to beneficiaries on a space available basis and in remote locations. Dental services
may include oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), implantology,
oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics.

The Department also provides a wide range of immunizations to Military Health Service beneficiaries, including
immunizations against common childhood diseases such as measles, smallpox and diphtheria and regional endemic
diseases such as yellow fever, plague and cholera. We also administer a variety of medications and test beneficiaries
for allergic conditions. Immunizations costs are not included as part of the reimbursement rates for either inpatient
or ambulatory care. We intend to seek reimbursement for immunizations against childhood diseases and diseases characteristic
of the United States and its Territories. We will also seek reimbursement for the administration of all medications
or allergy extracts, when the medication or extract is purchased by the medical treatment facility, and for the testing
for allergic conditions. We do not intend to seek recovery for immunizations administered incident to overseas travel
or transfer, or for those medications purchased by the beneficiary and simply administered at the medical treatment
facility. The reimbursement rate shall be based on the average fully burdened cost of an immunization and a separate
charge shall be applied for each immunization which is administered.



D. Other Revisions



We received one public comment on the proposed rule. It was from a group of organizations who objected to the provision
in the proposed rule concerning PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics. In the proposed rule, we proposed to eliminate from the
Third Party Collection Program regulation the special rule regarding PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics, which are contractor
owned, contractor operated freestanding clinics under contract with DoD. Under special demonstration program
authority, these clinics have functioned under rules applicable to military medical treatment facilities, including
Third Party Collection program rules. With the conclusion of the demonstration project, these clinics are no longer
authorized to bill third party payers under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1095 (but will continue to bill under other authority).
Therefore, the change set forth in the proposed rule is necessary, and has been included in the final rule.

The organizations who objected to this proposed change did so on the belief that this would terminate features of PRIMUS
and NAVCARE clinics that they strongly support, including access to primary care visits without deductible or copayment
requirements, and eligibility for military beneficiaries who are not CHAMPUS eligible (such as active duty members
and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries). These organizations can be assured that the adoption of this final rule has
no impact on those aspects of the PRIMUS/NAVCARE program.

We have added one other revision to the regulation, a technical correction to section 220.8(d), which had incorrectly
referred to paragraph (j) concerning a matter for which paragraph (k) is the appropriate reference.



III. Regulatory Procedures



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. It will not have an impact of $100
million or other significant economic impacts. Similarly, the rule does not significantly affect a substantial
number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As stated above, for the most part,
this final rule simply incorporates into the third party collection program regulation more precise cost calculation
methods. In addition, this rule does not impose new information collection requirements for purposes of the Paperwork
Reduction Act.



List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 220



Claims, Health care, Health insurance.




For the reasons stated in the preamble, 32 CFR Part 220 is amended as follows:



PART 220_COLLECTION FROM THIRD PARTY PAYERS OF REASONABLE COSTS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES



1. The authority citation for part 220 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 301; 10 U.S.C. 1095.




2. Section 220.8 is amended by revising paragraph (a), the heading and first sentence of paragraph (c), and paragraphs
(d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) as follows:



 220.8 

Reasonable costs.



(a) 

Diagnosis related group (DRG)-based method for calculating reasonable costs for inpatient services.

(1) In general. 

As authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3), the calculation of reasonable costs for purposes of collections for inpatient
hospital care under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part shall be based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Costs shall be based
on the inpatient full reimbursement rate per hospital discharge, weighted to reflect the intensity of the principal
diagnosis involved. The average cost per case shall be published annually as an inpatient standardized amount. A
relative weight for each DRG shall be the same as the DRG weights published annually for hospital reimbursement rates
under the Civilian Health and Medicare Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1).

(2) 

Standardized amount. 

The standardized amount shall be determined by dividing the total costs of all inpatient care in all military medical
treatment facilities by the total number of discharges. This will produce a single national standardized amount.
The Department of Defense is authorized, but not required by this part to calculate three standardized amounts, one
each for large urban areas, other urban areas, and rural areas, utilizing the same distinctions in identifying those
areas as is used for CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1).

(3) 

DRG relative weights. 

Costs for each DRG will be determined by multiplying the standardized amount per discharge by the DRG relative weight.
For this purpose, the DRG relative weights used for CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1) shall be used.

(4) 

Adjustments for outliers, area wages, and indirect medical education.

 The Department of Defense may, but is not required by this part, to adjust cost determinations in particular cases
for length-of-stay outliers (long stay and short stay), cost outliers, area wage rates, and indirect medical education.
If any such adjustments are used, the method shall be comparable to that used for CHAMPUS hospital reimbursements
pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E), and the calculation of the standardized amount under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section will reflect that such adjustments will be used.

(5) 

Identification of professional and hospital costs. 

For purposes of billing third party payers other that automobile liability and no-fault insurance carriers, inpatient
billings will be subdivided into two categories:

(1) Hospital charges (which refers to routine service charges associated with the hospital stay and ancillary charges).

(ii) Professional charges (which refers to professional services provided by physicians and certain other providers).

(6) Outpatient billings will continue to be subdivided into three categories:

(i) Hospital charges (which refers to routine service charges associated with the outpatient visit).

(ii) Professional charges (which refers to professional services provided by physicians and certain other providers).

(iii) Ancillary charges (which refers to diagnostic and treatment services, other than professional services,
provided by components of the hospital in connection with the outpatient visit).



* * * * *



(c) 

Clinical groups per diem rates for care provided on or after October 1, 1992, and prior to October 1, 1994. 

For inpatient hospital care provided on or after October 1, 1992, and prior to October 1, 1994, the computation of reasonable
costs shall be based on the per diem full reimbursement rate applicable to the clinical category of services involved.
* * *



* * * * *



(d) 

Medical services and subsistence charges included.

 Medical services charges pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1078 or subsistence charges pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1075 are included
in the claim filed with the third party payer pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095. For any patient of a facility of the Uniformed
Services who indicates that he or she is a beneficiary of a third party payer plan, the usual medical services or subsistence
charge will not be collected from the patient to the extent that payment received from the payer exceeds the medical
services or subsistence charge. Thus, except in cases covered by section 220.8(k), payment of the claim made pursuant
to 10 U.S.C. 1095 which exceeds the medical services or subsistence charge, will satisfy all of the third party payer's
obligation arising from the inpatient hospital care provided by the facility of the Uniformed Services on that occasion.

<TEXT>
 

(e) 

Per visit rates.



(1) As authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(2), the computation of reasonable costs for purposes of collections for most
outpatient services shall be based on a per visit rate for a clinical specialty or subspecialty. The per visit charge
shall be equal to the outpatient full reimbursement rate for that clinical specialty or subspecialty and includes
all routine ancillary services. A separate charge will be calculated for cases that are considered same day/ambulatory
surgeries. These rates shall be updated and published annually. As with inpatient billing categories, clinical
groups representing selected board certified specialties/subspecialties widely accepted by graduate medical
accrediting organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American
Board of Medical Specialties will be used for ambulatory billing categories. Related clinical groups may be combined
for purposes of billing categories.

(2) The following clinical reimbursement categories are representative, but not all-inclusive of the billing category
clinical groups referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section: Internal Medicine, Allergy, Cardiology, Diabetic,
Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Hypertension, Nephrology, Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Pulmonary
Disease, Rheumatology, Dermatology, Infectious Disease, Physical Medicine, General Surgery, Cardiovascular
and Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Organ Transplant, Otolaryngology, Plastic Surgery, Proctology,
Urology, Pediatric Surgery, Family Planning, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Adolescent Pediatrics, Well
Baby, Orthopaedics, Cast, Orthotic Laboratory, Hand Surgery, Podiatry, Psychiatry, Psychology, Child Guidance,
Mental Health, Social Work, Substance Abuse Rehabilitation, Family Practice, and Occupational and Physical Therapy.



* * * * *



(g) 

Special rule for services ordered and paid for by a facility of the Uniformed Services but provided by another provider.

 In cases where a facility of the Uniformed Services purchases ancillary services or procedures, from a source other
than a Uniformed Services facility, the cost of the purchased services will be added to the standard rate. Examples
of ancillary services and other procedures covered by this special rule include (but are not limited to): laboratory,
radiology, pharmacy, pulmonary function, cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, hyperbaric medicine, electrocardiography,
electroencephalography, electroneuromyography, pulmonary function, inhalation and respiratory therapy and
physical therapy services.

(h) 

Special rule for certain ancillary services ordered by outside providers and provided by a facility of the Uniformed
Services.

 If a Uniformed Services facility provides certain ancillary services, prescription drugs or other procedures based
on a request from a source other than a Uniformed Services facility and are not incident to any outpatient visit or inpatient
services, the reasonable cost will not be based on the usual per diem or per visit rate. Rather, a separate standard
rate shall be established based on the cost of the particular high-cost service, drug, or procedure provided. This
special rule applies only to services, drugs or procedures having a cost of at least $60. The reasonable cost for the
services, drugs or procedures to which this special rule applies shall be calculated and published annually.

(i) 

Miscellaneous health care services.

 Some outpatient services are provided which may not traditionally be provided in hospitals or which are not traditional
clinical specialties or subspecialties. This includes, but is not limited to, land ambulance service, air ambulance
service, hyperbaric treatments, dental care services and immunizations.

(1) The charge for ambulance services shall be based on the full costs of operating the ambulance service.

(2) For hyperbaric treatments (such as high pressure oxygenation treatments, burn treatments and decompression
treatments in response to diving incidents), charges will be based on the full operating costs of the hyperbaric treatment
services.

(3) Charges for dental services (including oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed
and removable), implantology, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics) will be based
on a full cost of the dental services.

(4) The charge for immunizations, allergin extracts, allergic condition tests, and the administration of certain
medications when these services are provided in a separate immunizations or shot clinic, will be based on the average
full cost of these services, exclusive of any costs considered for purposes of any outpatient visit. A separate charge
shall be made for each immunization, injection or medication administered.



* * * * *



(k) 

Special rule for partnership program providers.

 In cases in which the professional provider services are provided under the Partnership Program (or similar program
operated under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1096), the professional charges component of the total standard rate will
be deleted, as applicable, from the claim for the facility of the Uniformed Services. The third party payer will receive
a claim for professional services directly from the individual healthcare provider, who is not an employee or agent
of the Department of Defense. Such claims are not covered by 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part, but are governed by statutory
and regulatory requirements of the CHAMPUS program (see 32 CFR part 199). The same is true for the professional services
provided on an outpatient basis under the Partnership Program.

(l) 

Alternative determination of reasonable costs.

 Any third party payer that can satisfactorily demonstrate a prevailing rate of payment in the same geographic area
for the same or similar aggregate groups of services that is less than the standard rate (or other amount as determined
under paragraphs (f) through (k) of this section) of the facility of the Uniformed Services may, with the agreement
of the facility of the Uniformed Services (or other authorized representatives of the United States), limit payments
under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to that prevailing rate for that aggregate category of services. The determination of the third
party payer's prevailing rate shall be based on a review of valid contractual arrangements with other facilities
or providers constituting a majority of the services for which payment is made under the third party payer's plan.
This paragraph does not apply to cases covered by  220.11.

 220.10


Special rules for Medicare supplement plans.

(c) * * *

(1) * * *

Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related Onshore Facilities; Correction


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; corrections.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is making technical corrections to errors in the technical appendices to the final rule for facility response
plans required by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34070).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


EPA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34070) revising the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation, 40 CFR part 112, originally promulgated
under the Clean Water Act. The revision incorporates new requirements added by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C.
2701 et seq., that direct facility owners and operators to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of
oil and to a substantial threat of such a discharge.


Need for Correction


As published, the final rule contained a number of minor technical errors that may prove to be misleading and are in
need of clarification. The reasons for these technical changes (including clarifying section references and correcting
minor grammatical errors) are, for the most part, self-evident. None of these changes is intended to effect substantive
requirements; they only correct inadvertent errors in the July 1, 1994 final rule and ensure consistency within the
Appendices to the final rule, and between them and the regulatory text.
Corrections 7 and 8, while also technical and non-substantive in nature, warrant a brief discussion. To avoid confusion,
corrections 7 and 8 are made to clarify that the Emergency Notification Phone List and Spill Response Notification
Form are each separate parts of Section 1.3.1 of the overall response plan. Thus, items 2 and 3 of Section 1.1 each call
for a partial inclusion of Section 1.3.1 (item 2 calls for the Emergency Notification Phone List and item 3 calls for
the Spill Response Notification Form). Together, items 2 and 3 call for the complete Section 1.3.1. As published,
the final rule incorrectly stated that items 2 and 3 each called for the complete Section 1.3.1. This is being corrected
to state that each calls for only part of Section 1.3.1.
In addition, an inaccuracy in the summary section of the preamble to the final rule needs to be noted. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency regulates 

non

-transportation-related facilities under sections 311(j)(1)(C) and 311(j)(5) of the CWA as delegated by Executive
Order 12777. The preamble language in one instance incorrectly and inadvertently indicated that the Oil Pollution
Prevention regulation applied to transportation-related facilities.


Correction of Publication


PART 112_[CORRECTED]


Accordingly, the final rule is corrected as follows:
1. On page 34110, in the third column, in the first paragraph under section A.2.3, in line 7, ``A2(b)'' is corrected
to read ``A.2.2''.
2. On page 34111, in the first column, in the first paragraph under section B.2.3, in line 9, ``B2(b)'' is corrected
to read ``B.2.2''.
3. On page 34112, in the first column, in section 1.2.8, the text which reads ``Other definitions are included in  112.2,
section 1.2 of Appendices C and E, and section 3.0 of Appendix F'' is corrected to read ``Other definitions are included
in  112.2 and section 1.1 of Appendix C''.
4. On page 34112, in the third column, in section 4.3, in line 9, the text which reads ``section 1.2'' is corrected to
read ``section 1.1''.
5. On page 34114, in the third column, in section 7.3, in line 4, the text which reads ``for Groups 1'' is corrected to
read ``for Group 1''.
6. On page 34115, in the first column, in section 7.4, in line 4, the text which reads ``for a facility'' is deleted.
7. On page 34124, in the first column, in section 1.1, in item 2, the word ``complete'' is corrected to read ``partial''.
8. On page 34124, in the first column, in section 1.1, in item 3, the word ``complete'' is corrected to read ``partial''.
9. On page 34135, in the second column, in the heading for section 2.1, the text which reads ``Page One_General Information''
is corrected to read ``General Information''.

<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule; correction of rule and confirmation of effective date.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This 

Order 

confirms that the stay of certain changes to the FCC's multiple ownership rule was lifted on September 16, 1992, and
reprints the corrected rule in its entirety. The Mass Media Bureau takes this action to ensure that the correct version
of the rule is printed in the Code of Federal Regulations. Because the stay was lifted in an ordering clause to a Commission
document but not in the Federal Register summary associated with that document, the lifting of the stay was not recognized
by the Federal Register. As a result, the rule is currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations as if the stay
was still in effect. This 

Order 

is intended solely to correct the outdated version of the multiple ownership rule; no substantive rule changes have
been made.

Order




Adopted: 

September 15, 1994


Released: 

September 19, 1994



In the Matter of: Revision of Radio Rules and Policies.



By the Acting Chief, Mass Media Bureau:
1. In its 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 91-140, 7 FCC Rcd 2755 (1992), 57 FR 18089 (April 29, 1992), the Commission amended 47 CFR 73.3555.
The effective date of the changes adopted in the 

Report and Order 

was subsequently deferred pending resolution of petitions for reconsideration. 

Order Deferring Effective Date 

in MM Docket No. 91-140, FCC 92-351 (released July 30, 1992), 57 FR 35763 (Aug. 11, 1992). The stay of the
effective date was lifted by 

Memorandum Opinion and Order 

in MM Docket No. 91-140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (September 16, 1992). Because the stay was lifted in
an ordering clause to the document rather than in the Appendix that contained the modified rules, the lifting of the
stay was not picked up by the Federal Register. As a result, the rule is currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations
as if the stay was still in effect.
2. This 

Order 

is intended solely to correct the outdated version of Section 73.3555 currently printed in the Code of Federal Regulations.
No substantive changes have been made to the rules; notice and comment are therefore unnecessary. 

See 

5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3). The correct version of  73.3555 is printed in its entirety below.
3. Accordingly, it is ordered that 47 CFR  73.3555 is amended as set forth below.

Rule Changes



Part 73 of Title 47 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations is amended to read as follows:



PART 73_RADIO BROADCAST SERVICES



1. The Authority Citation for Part 73 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 334.




2. The stay of the effective date of  73.3555 was lifted by publication of a 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in MM Docket No. 91-140 in the 

Federal Register

 at 57 FR 42701 (September 16, 1992), and  73.3555 is revised to read as follows:



 73.3555

Multiple ownership.



(a)(1) 

Radio contour overlap rule.

 No license for an AM or FM broadcasting station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control)
if the grant of such license will result in overlap of the principal community contour of that station and the principal
community contour of any other broadcasting station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or controlled by the
same party, except that such license may be granted in connection with a transfer or assignment from an existing party
with such interests, or in the following circumstances:

(i) In radio markets with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own up to 3 commercial radio stations, no
more than 2 of which are in the same service (AM or FM), provided that the owned stations, if other than a single AM and
FM station combination, represent less than 50 percent of the stations in the market.

(ii) In radio markets with 15 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own up to 2 AM and 2 FM commercial stations,
provided, however, that evidence that grant of any application will result in a combined audience share exceeding
25 percent will be considered 

prima facie

 inconsistent with the public interest.






Note 

to paragraph (a)(1)(ii): When evaluating audience share evidence submitted under  73.3555(a)(1)(ii), the
Commission will consider data that eliminates statistical anomalies, provides a better focused survey area or includes
revenue data or other relevant information. Where applicants certify that they do not have readily available audience
share data, they may substitute other information that can serve as a proxy for such data. 

See Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in MM Docket No. 91-140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (Sept. 16, 1992).




(iii) Overlap between two stations in different services is permissible if neither of those two stations overlaps
a third station in the same service.

(2)(i) Where the principal community contours of two radio stations overlap and a party (including all parties under
common control) with an attributable ownership interest in one such station brokers more than 15 percent of the broadcast
time per week of the other such station, that party shall be treated as if it has an interest in the brokered station subject
to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section. This limitation shall apply regardless of the
source of the brokered programming supplied by the party to the brokered station.

(ii) Every time brokerage agreement of the type described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be undertaken
only pursuant to a signed written agreement that shall contain a certification by the licensee or permittee of the
brokered station verifying that it maintains ultimate control over the station's facilities, including specifically
control over station finances, personnel and programming, and by the brokering station that the agreement complies
with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (e)(1) of this section. 

(iii) Any party operating in conflict with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section on September
16, 1992 shall come into compliance within one year thereafter.

(3) For purposes of this paragraph:

(i) The ``principal community contour'' for AM stations is the predicted or measured 5 mV/m groundwave contour computed
in accordance with  73.183 or   73.186 and for FM stations is the predicted 3.16 mV/m contour computed in
accordance with  73.313.

(ii) The number of stations in a radio market is the number of commercial stations whose principal community contours
overlap, in whole or in part, with the principal community contours of the stations in question (

i.e.,

 the station for which an authorization is sought and any station in the same service that would be commonly owned whose
principal community contour overlaps the principal community contour of that station). In addition, if the area
of overlap between the stations in question is overlapped by the principal community contour of a commonly owned station
or stations in a different service (AM or FM), the number of stations in the market includes stations whose principal
community contours overlap the principal community contours of such commonly owned station or stations in a different
service.

(iii) A station's ``audience share'' is the average number of persons age 12 or older on an average quarter hour basis,
Monday-Sunday, 6 a.m.-midnight, who listen to the station, expressed as a percentage of the average number of persons
listening to AM and FM stations in that radio metro market or a recognized equivalent, in which a majority of the overlap
between the stations in question takes place. The ``combined audience share'' is the total audience share of all AM
or FM stations that would be under common ownership or control following a proposed acquisition. In situations where
no metro market or recognized equivalent exists, the relevant audience share data are the data for all counties that
are within the principal community contours of the stations in question, in whole or in part.

(iv) ``Time brokerage'' is the sale by a licensee of discrete blocks of time to a ``broker'' that supplies the programming
to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements in it.


(b) 

Television contour overlap (duopoly) rule

. No license for a TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if
the grant of such license will result in overlap of the Grade B contour of that station (computed in accordance with
 73.684) and the Grade B contour of any other TV broadcast station directly or indirectly owned, operated, or
controlled by the same party.

(c) 

One-to-a-market ownership rule

. No license for an AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control)
if such party directly or indirectly owns, operates or controls one or more such broadcast stations and the grant of
such license will result in:

(1) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an existing or proposed AM station, computed in accordance
with  73.183 or  73.186, encompassing the entire community of license of an existing or proposed TV broadcast

(d) 

Daily newspaper cross-ownership rule

. No license for an AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control)
if such party directly or indirectly owns, operates or controls a daily newspaper and the grant of such license will
result in:
(1) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m contour of an AM station, computed in accordance with  73.183 or  73.186,
encompassing the entire community in which such newspaper is published; or
(2) The predicted 1 mV/m contour for an FM station, computed in accordance with  73.313, encompassing the entire
community in which such newspaper is published; or
(3) The Grade A contour of a TV station, computed in accordance with  73.684, encompassing the entire community
in which such newspaper is published.
(e)(1) 

National multiple ownership rule

. No license for a commercial AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall be granted, transferred or assigned to any party (including
all parties under common control) if the grant, transfer or assignment of such license would result in such party or
any of its stockholders, partners, members, officers or directors, directly or indirectly, owning, operating or
controlling, or having a cognizable interest in:
(i) More than 18 AM or more than 18 FM stations, or more than 20 AM or more than 20 FM stations two years after the effective
date of this rule, provided, however, that an entity may have an attributable but noncontrolling interest in an additional
3 AM and 3 FM stations that are small business controlled or minority-controlled;
(ii) More than 14 television stations; or
(iii) More than 12 television stations that are not minority-controlled.
(2) No license for a commercial TV broadcast station shall be granted, transferred or assigned to any party (including
all parties under common control) if the grant, transfer or assignment of such license would result in such party or
any of its stockholders, partners, members, officers or directors, directly or indirectly, owning, operating or
controlling, or having a cognizable interest in, either:
(i) TV stations which have an aggregate national audience reach exceeding thirty (30) percent, or
(ii) TV stations which have an aggregate national audience reach exceeding twenty-five (25) percent and which are
not minority-controlled.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph:
(i) 

National audience reach

 means the total number of television households in the Arbitron Area of Dominant Influence (ADI) markets in which
the relevant stations are located divided by the total national television households as measured by ADI data at the
time of a grant, transfer or assignment of a license. For purposes of making this calculation, UHF television stations
shall be attributed with 50 percent of the television households in their ADI market. Where the relevant application
forms require a showing with respect to audience reach and the application relates to an area where Arbitron ADI market
data are unavailable, then the applicant shall make a showing as to the number of television households in its market.
Upon such a showing, the Commission shall make a determination as to the appropriate audience reach to be attributed
to the applicant.
(ii) 

TV broadcast station or TV station

 excludes stations which are primarily satellite operations.
(iii) 

Minority-controlled

 means more than 50 percent owned by one or more members of a minority group.
(iv) 

Minority

 means Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander.
(v) 

Small business

 means an individual or business entity which, at the time of application to the Commission, had, including all affiliated
entities under common control, annual revenues of less than $500,000 and assets of less than $1,000,000.
(f) This section is not applicable to noncommercial educational FM and noncommercial educational TV stations.





Note 1:

 The word ``control'' as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control
in whatever manner exercised.





Note 2:

 In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other interests in broadcast licensees, cable television
systems and daily newspapers will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following
criteria:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940926-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940926-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct ownership interests and any voting stock interest
amounting to 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system
or daily newspaper will be cognizable;

(b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding
voting stock of the corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper in which the minority
interest is held;

(c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through
their trust departments in trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if they hold 10% or
more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper,
or if any of the officers or directors of the broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are representatives
of the investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated
if the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment companies
will be aggregated if under common management.

(d) Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper that
are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication
of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution
benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds
50%, it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. [For example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns
60% of company Y, which owns 25% of ``Licensee,'' then X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same as Y's interest
since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1 x 0.25). Under the 5%
attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.]

(e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at
will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship
to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests
held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution
with the trust's assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the relevant broadcast
licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are subject to said trust.

(f) Holders of non-voting stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity. Holders of debt and instruments
such as warrants, convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests with rights of conversion to voting
interests shall not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected.

(g)(1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a limited partner unless that partner is not materially
involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media-related activities of the partnership
and the licensee or system so certifies.

(2) In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it must
verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with respect to the particular limited
partner exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material involvement, directly
or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media activities of the partnership. The criteria which would
assume adequate insulation for purposes of this certification are described in the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 85-252 (released June 24, 1985), as modified on reconsideration in the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 86-410 (released November 28, 1986). Irrespective of the terms of the certificate
of limited partnership or partnership agreement, however, no such certification shall be made if the individual
or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the limited partners in the
management or operation of the media-related businesses of the partnership.

(h) Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are considered to
have a cognizable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses
in addition to its primary business of broadcasting, cable television service or newspaper publication, it may request
the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated
to its primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a broadcast licensee, cable television
system or daily newspaper, with an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable
interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly
unrelated to the broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper subsidiary, and a statement properly
documenting this fact is submitted to the Commission. [This statement may be included on the appropriate Ownership
Report.] The officers and directors of a sister corporation of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily
newspaper shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by virtue of such status.

(i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining whether or not an interest is cognizable under
this section. An individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:

(1) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or

(2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent;
or

(3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this section plus the sum of the interests computed
under paragraph (i)(2) of this section is equal to or exceeds 10 percent.






Note 3:

 In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting stock is not identical (

e.g.

, bank nominees holding stock as record owners for the benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses holding stock in street
names for the benefit of customers, investment advisors holding stock in their own names for the benefit of clients,
and insurance companies holding stock), the party having the right to determine how the stock will be voted will be
considered to own it for purposes of these rules.






Note 4:

 Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not be applied so as to require divestiture, by any licensee, of existing
facilities, and will not apply to applications for increased power for Class C stations, to applications for assignment
of license or transfer of control filed in accordance with  73.3540(f) or  73.3541(b), or to applications
for assignment of license or transfer of control to heirs or legatees by will or intestacy if no new or increased overlap
would be created between commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations in the same service and if no new
encompassment of Communities proscribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section as to commonly owned, operated
or controlled broadcast stations or daily newspaper would result. Said paragraphs will apply to all applications
for new stations, to all other applications for assignment or transfer, and to all applications for major changes
in existing stations except major changes that will result in overlap of contours of broadcast stations in the same
service with each other no greater than already existing. (The resulting areas of overlap of contours of such broadcast
stations with each other in such major change cases may consist partly or entirely of new terrain. However, if the population
in the resulting areas substantially exceeds that in the previously existing overlap areas, the Commission will
not grant the application if it finds that to do so would be against the public interest, convenience or necessity.)
Commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations with overlapping contours or with community-encompassing
contours prohibited by this section may not be assigned or transferred to a single person, group or entity, except
as provided above in this note and by  73.3555(a). If a commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast station
and daily newspaper fall within the encompassing proscription of this section, the station may not be assigned to
a single person, group or entity if the newspaper is being simultaneously sold to such single person, group or entity.

Note 5: 

Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not be applied to cases involving television stations that are ``satellite''
operations. Such cases will be considered in accordance with the analysis set forth in the 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 87-8, FCC 91-182( released July 8, 1991), in order to determine whether common ownership,
operation, or control of the stations in question would be in the public interest. An authorized and operating ``satellite''
television station, the Grade B contour of which overlaps that of a commonly owned, operated, or controlled ``non-satellite''
parent television broadcast station, or the Grade A contour of which completely encompasses the community of publication
of a commonly owned, operated, or controlled daily newspaper, or the community of license of a commonly owned, operated,
or controlled AM or FM broadcast station, or the community of license of which is completely encompassed by the 2 mV/m
contour of such AM broadcast station or the 1 mV/m contour of such FM broadcast station, may subsequently become a ``non-satellite''
station under the circumstances described in the aforementioned 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 87-8. However, such commonly owned, operated, or controlled ``non-satellite'' television
stations and AM or FM stations with the aforementioned community encompassment, may not be transferred or assigned
to a single person, group, or entity except as provided in Note 4 of this section. Nor shall any application for assignment
or transfer concerning such ``non-satellite'' stations be granted if the assignment or transfer would be to the same
person, group or entity to which the commonly owned, operated, or controlled newspaper is proposed to be transferred,
except as provided in Note 4 of this section.










Note 6: 

For the purposes of this section a daily newspaper is one which is published four or more days per week, which is in the
English language and which is circulated generally in the community of publication. A college newspaper is not considered
as being circulated generally.









Note 7: 

The Commission will entertain requests to waive the restrictions of paragraph (c) of this section on a case-by-case
basis. The Commission will look favorably upon waiver applications that meet either of the following two standards:






(1) Those involving radio and television station combinations in the top 25 television markets where there will be
at least 30 separately owned, operated and controlled broadcast licensees after the proposed combination, as determined
by counting television licensees in the relevant ADI television market and radio licensees in the relevant television
metropolitan market; 


(2) Those involving ``failed'' broadcast stations that have not been operated for a substantial period of time, 

e.g., 

four months, or that are involved in bankruptcy proceedings. For the purposes of determining the top 25 ADI television
markets, the relevant ADI television market, and the relevant television metropolitan market for each prospective
combination, we will use the most recent 

Arbitron Ratings Television ADI Market Guide. 

We will determine that number of radio stations in the relevant television metropolitan market and the number of television
licensees within the relevant ADI television market based on the most recent Commission ownership records.





Other waiver requests will be evaluated on a more rigorous case-by-case basis, as set forth in the 

Second Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 87-7, FCC 88-407, released February 23, 1989, and 

Memorandum Opinion and Order 

in MM Docket No. 87-7, FCC 89-256, released August 4, 1989.









Note 8:

 Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to an application for an AM station license in the 535-1605 kHz
band where grant of such application will result in the overlap of 5 mV/m groundwave contours of the proposed station
and that of another AM station in the 535-1605 kHz band that is commonly owned, operated or controlled if the applicant
shows that a significant reduction in interference to adjacent or co-channel stations would accompany such common
ownership. Such AM overlap cases will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether common ownership,
operation or control of the stations in question would be in the public interest. Applicants in such cases must submit
a contingent application of the major or minor facilities change needed to achieve the interference reduction along
with the application which seeks to create the 5 
mV/m overlap situation.










Note 9: 

Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to an application for an AM station license in the 1605-1705 kHz
band where grant of such application will result in the overlap of the 5 mV/m groundwave contours of the proposed station
and that of another AM station in the 535-1605 kHz band that is commonly owned, operated or controlled. Paragraphs
(d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section will not apply to an application for an AM station license in the 1605-1705
kHz band by an entity that owns, operates, controls or has a cognizable interest in AM radio stations in the 535-1605
kHz band.










Note 10: 

Authority for joint ownership granted pursuant to Note 9 will expire at 3 a.m. local time on the fifth anniversary for
the date of issuance of a construction permit for an AM radio station in the 1605-1705 kHz band.

I. Background
 


A. General Information 


Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard 
temperature and pressure.
 When used as a motor fuel, natural 
gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical 
containers at a pressure of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure 
(3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to 
increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. 
This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. 
Since natural gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high 
pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor 
vehicle safety. 




Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, 
although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in the 
United States more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at 
the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to 
again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As 
discussed in detail in a final rule regarding CNG vehicles 
published on April 25, 1994, recent Federal legislation, as well 
as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will 
lead to greater increases in the production and use of these 
vehicles. (59 FR 19648).

B. Previous Agency Rulemakings



On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency
should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) applicable to CNG fuel containers and the fuel systems
of motor vehicles using CNG or liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561). The ANPRM sought comment
about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief
for such containers.

On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish
a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG. (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on
comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information. The NPRM was divided into two segments:
(1) vehicle requirements that focus on the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements that
focus on the fuel containers alone.

NHTSA decided to model the proposed requirements applicable to CNG fueled motor vehicles on Standard No. 301, 

Fuel System Integrity. 

Standard No. 301 specifies performance requirements for vehicles that use fuel with a boiling point above 32 




Fahrenheit (i.e., fuels that are liquid under standard temperature and pressure). Vehicles manufactured to use
only CNG are not subject to Standard No. 301 since CNG has a boiling point below 32 




F. Standard No. 301 limits the amount of fuel spillage from ``light vehicles''
 during and after frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests and a static rollover test. The Standard also limits
fuel spillage from school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds after being impacted by a moving contoured barrier at
any point and any angle. By basing the CNG rulemaking on Standard No. 301, the agency believed that passengers of CNG
vehicles would be afforded a level of safety comparable to that provided passengers of vehicles fueled by gasoline
or diesel fuel. 





With respect to the ``vehicle'' requirements for CNG vehicles, NHTSA proposed that the fuel system integrity requirements
would include frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles, and a moving contoured barrier crash
test for large school buses. The agency proposed that fuel system integrity would be determined by measuring the fuel
system's pressure drop after the crash test rather than fuel spillage, since CNG is a vapor and not a liquid. The allowable
pressure drop for CNG fueled vehicles would be equivalent, as measured by the energy content of the lost fuel, to the
allowable spillage of gasoline during Standard No. 301 compliance testing. 

With respect to the ``equipment'' requirements for CNG containers, NHTSA proposed a definition for ``CNG fuel tank''
and performance requirements that would apply to all such fuel containers manufactured for use as part of a fuel system
on any motor vehicle, including aftermarket containers.
 Thus, while vehicles with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds (other than school buses) would not be subject to Standard No. 303,
the CNG containers in those vehicles would be subject to the equipment requirements. The agency proposed that each
CNG container would be subject to a pressure cycling test to evaluate container durability and a pressure burst test
to evaluate the container's initial strength as well as its resistance to degradation over time. In addition, the
NPRM proposed requirements to regulate how the container ``vents'' its contents under specified conditions of elevated
temperature and pressure. 





II. Comments on the Proposal 



NHTSA received a large number of comments to the docket addressing the CNG proposal. The commenters included manufacturers
of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses, research organizations,
State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies. In addition, NHTSA met
with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and had telephone conversations
and meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed in the public docket. 

The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and
fuel containers is necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container
manufacturers stated that NHTSA should issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious
introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. With respect to the equipment requirements, the commenters generally believed
that Federal requirements about CNG fuel container integrity are needed and should be implemented as quickly as possible.
The CNG vehicle industry, led by CGA and NGVC, expressed concern that lack of Federal regulations has created a problem
for the industry, given the issuance of potentially conflicting industry and State regulations. Therefore, these
commenters stated that CNG container manufacturers may not know the appropriate standards to which they should manufacture
their containers. In contrast, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) stated that the vehicle
system requirements are sufficient to regulate the overall integrity of CNG fueled vehicles and that separate requirements
for CNG fuel containers are not needed. Nevertheless, AAMA provided detailed comments about the container proposal
in case the agency decided to issue separate container requirements. 

The commenters addressed a variety of issues discussed in the NPRM. These issues include the appropriateness of adopting
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) voluntary industry standard known as NGV2;
 the pressure cycling requirements and test procedures; the burst requirements and test procedures, including the
proposed safety factor, hold time interval, and need for sequential testing; the pressure relief requirements and
test procedures, including types of pressure relief devices, shielding, test gas, test pressure, test fuel, and
fuel pan depth; labeling requirements; leadtime; costs; and benefits. 





NHTSA issued an SNPRM proposing to pattern the burst requirements more closely on NGV2, based on its consultation
with other Federal agencies, its review of comments to the January 1993 proposal, and other available information.
(58 FR 68846, December 29, 1993). NHTSA proposed a burst test that would link the use of particular designs and materials
to compliance with safety factors tailored to those designs and materials. NHTSA requested comment on the appropriateness
of requiring CNG containers to meet design and material requirements, such as those specified in NGV2, and to meet
safety factors tailored to those requirements. As an alternative approach, the agency asked whether it should specify
a catch-all high end safety factor for any container whose design and materials are not specified in NGV2.

Most commenters supported the proposal to incorporate NGV2 into the Federal standard. However, AAMA and Ford opposed
the design and material specific approach of NGV2. 



III. Agency's Decision 



A. Overview 



In today's final rule, NHTSA is issuing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304, 

Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers, 

that specifies performance requirements applicable to a CNG fuel container's durability, strength, and venting.
A pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability by requiring a container to withstand, without any leakage,
18,000 cycles of pressurization and depressurization. This requirement helps to ensure that a CNG container is capable
of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings over its entire service life. A burst test
evaluates a container's initial strength and resistance to degradation over time. This requirement helps to ensure
that a container's design and material are appropriately strong over the container's life. A bonfire test evaluates
a container's pressure relief characteristics when pressure builds in a container, primarily due to temperature
rise. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG fuel containers.


As previously mentioned, the agency has issued a final rule establishing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard,
Standard No. 303, 

Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, 

that specifies vehicle performance requirements applicable to the fuel system of a CNG fueled vehicle. As explained
in that final rule, the fuel system integrity requirements are comparable to those requirements in Standard No. 301.
Like that Standard, the new requirements limit the amount of fuel leakage in specified frontal, rear, and lateral
barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000
pounds.

NHTSA believes that CNG containers must be evaluated in all possible failure modes and environments to which they
may be subjected. Since the requirements contained in today's final rule do not address all these situations, the
agency is currently investigating other possible requirements for CNG fuel containers and anticipates issuing
a SNPRM that would propose performance requirements applicable to such characteristics as a CNG fuel container's
internal and external resistance to corrosion, brittle fracture, fragmentation, and external damage caused by
incidental contact with road debris or mechanical damage during the vehicle's operation. The agency tentatively
believes that these additional performance requirements are critical for determining a CNG container's safety.
In addition, the agency anticipates proposing additional labeling requirements that should provide critical safety
information about inspecting a CNG container and its service life.

NHTSA notes that it has no statutory authority to regulate certain aspects involving CNG containers, including inspection
requirements during the manufacturing process, in-use inspection requirements, and retest requirements during
use. 



B. Adopting Industry Standards



In the NPRM, NHTSA explained its decision to propose pressure cycling and burst tests and requirements. While the
agency's proposal was based on NGV2, the agency decided not to propose certain provisions of the voluntary industry
standard that the agency tentatively believed might unreasonably restrict future designs. Similarly, NHTSA decided
not to propose regulations issued by the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA)
 for CNG storage containers used on motor vehicles, explaining that the RSPA regulations do not address the conditions
unique to the motor vehicle environment (e.g., increased cycling due to refueling and pressure relief when the cylinder
is less than full). NHTSA further explained that in contrast to RSPA, NHTSA does not typically regulate design and
materials since NHTSA is statutorily directed to issue performance-based safety standards.





NGVC and several CNG container manufacturers stated that NHTSA should adopt the voluntary industry standard that
has been developed by the CNG industry working group. In support of this request, the American Gas Association (AGA)
cited a 1982 Office of Management and Budget Circular that states ``It is the policy of the Federal Government to (a)
Rely on voluntary standards * * * whenever feasible and consistent with law and regulation pursuant
to law * * *.'' AGA and NGVC believed that the voluntary standards provide a higher level of safety than
the regulations proposed by NHTSA. They further stated that if NHTSA were unable to adopt NGV2 due to its prescriptive
nature, then NHTSA should still allow automobile and equipment manufacturers the option of certifying to the industry
standard by referencing NGV2 in the regulations.

In promulgating a CNG container standard, NHTSA has sought to the extent possible to adopt the tests and requirements
set forth in NGV2. NHTSA was limited in its ability to do this by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety
Act, 49 U.S.C. 30111), which commands the agency to issue ``motor vehicle safety standards'' as minimum standards
of motor vehicle performance that are practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and are stated in objective
terms. NHTSA found it necessary to modify certain elements of NGV2 to be consistent with this statutory mandate. For
instance, the agency has not incorporated those aspects of NGV2 that are stated in nonobjective terms (e.g., a container
shall not show ``evidence'' of deterioration or failure) NHTSA has decided to incorporate NGV2's design and material
requirements since the agency has been unable to find or develop a meaningful dynamic performance requirement that
would adequately evaluate a container's initial strength and susceptibility to degradation over time. The agency
believes that the requirements are no more specific than necessary to achieve these safety purposes.

NHTSA notes that it would be impermissible under the Safety Act for the agency to adopt FMVSS provisions referencing
NGV2 in its entirety and stating that automobile and equipment manufacturers had the option of certifying compliance
to NGV2 by referencing this voluntary industry standard. The Safety Act provides for manufacturer self-certification
with respect to FMVSSs only. To be part of a FMVSS, the provisions of a voluntary industry standard must fully meet all
of the requirements of the Safety Act. Since all of NGV2 does not meet these requirements, NGV2 may not be incorporated
in its entirety. Even if NGV2 met these requirements, NGV2 could not be incorporated in the FMVSS except to the extent
that the FMVSS made compliance with NGV2 mandatory. 



C. Pressure Cycling Test



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed pressure cycling requirements that would require that the fuel container withstand a
cycling test at ambient temperature, without any leakage or deformation exceeding one percent of any circumference.
In the test, the container would be hydrostatically pressurized to the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent
of the service pressure, for 13,000 cycles. The container would next be hydrostatically pressurized to 125 percent
of the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, for 5,000 cycles. The cycling rate
would not exceed ten cycles per minute. 



1. Number of Cycles



The proposed cycling requirements were intended to establish minimum levels of safety performance for the durability
of CNG fuel containers used in motor vehicles. The agency stated its tentative belief that the requirements are consistent
with provisions in NGV2 and with RSPA regulations for containers used to transport CNG. The agency believed that the
pressure cycling requirement would help to assure that a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads
imposed on the container during refuelings. The number of cycles specified in the proposal, 13,000 plus 5,000, is
representative of four refuelings per day, 300 days per year, for 15 years.

AAMA, Norris, and Thomas commented on the number of pressure cycles. These commenters stated that the proposed number
of cycles was excessive and not representative of the actual operating conditions the CNG containers would typically
experience. AAMA and Norris stated that cycling the container at 125 percent of service pressure for 5,000 cycles
would be adequate. Thomas made inconsistent statements about the appropriate number of cycles. On the one hand, it
stated that 9,000 cycles at service pressure would be more reasonable than the proposed number of cycles. On the other
hand, it stated that the agency should adopt NGV2 which specifies 18,000 cycles.

After reviewing the comments and other available information, NHTSA continues to believe that the proposed number
of pressure cycles accurately represents the extreme conditions that CNG fuel containers could experience during
their lifetime, with a margin of safety. This is based on the large number of cycles to which fleet vehicles are subjected.
The agency believes that the 5,000 cycles suggested by AAMA and Norris would not ensure the safety of vehicles that
experience multiple refuelings each day, such as taxis and other fleets. NHTSA further notes that the number of cycles
being adopted is consistent with the cycles in NGV2 and therefore establishes a minimum level of safety that is consistent
with NGV2, a standard supported by a large majority of the commenters. Accordingly, the agency has determined that
a CNG fuel container will be subject to 18,000 pressure cycles.



2. Failure Criteria



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a CNG fuel container would have to meet two test criteria to pass the pressure cycling
test: (1) No leakage, and (2) no permanent circumferential deformation greater than one percent. The agency proposed
these two criteria to provide objective means of evaluating a container's durability during compliance testing.
NHTSA adopted the no leakage portion of the proposal from NGV2's pressure cycling test. The one percent deformation
level, which is not in NGV2's pressure cycling test, was based on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended
Practice J10, August 1985, a requirement involving the performance of metal air brake reservoirs. The agency proposed
a limit on circumferential deformation to aid in determining when a container's failure was impending.

No commenters objected to the no leakage criterion. Accordingly, the agency has adopted the no leakage requirement
in the final rule. The agency believes that specifying that containers ``shall not leak'' provides an objective measure
that will ensure that a container maintains its integrity by retaining its contents under pressure.

Sixteen commenters addressed the issue of the allowable circumferential deformation criterion. The commenters
were NGVC, Brunswick, Pressed Steel Tank (PST), Structural Composites Industry (SCI), Tecogen, CGA, AAMA, Amoco,
Alusuisse, Oklahoma Gas, ARC, Flxible, Fiber Dynamics, Norris, Comdyne, and EDO. All the commenters, except Brunswick,
believed that the agency should not include a deformation requirement in the pressure cycling or burst tests. The
commenters believed that the test requirement is not appropriate for all container materials and designs. They stated
that due to the nature of the different materials used in these containers, and their different rates of deformation
under load, some materials such as fiberglass, would deform more than others, such as steel. The commenters also stated
that deformation was not an indicator of impending failure and that the SAE brake reservoir test was not appropriate
for a CNG fuel container application.

NHTSA has decided not to adopt the one percent circumferential deformation requirement. In proposing this criterion,
NHTSA tentatively concluded that it would be an appropriate indicator of the fuel container's durability characteristics.
However, as the comments note, it is not an appropriate criterion because of the differing construction and materials
used for CNG fuel container applications. After reviewing the comments and other available information, the agency
now believes that limiting the circumferential deformation is not a meaningful way to determine a container's strength
or impending failure, since the larger deformation experienced by some materials does not necessarily represent
these characteristics. Instead, the agency believes that the no-leakage requirement, by itself, is the appropriate
criterion to define a container failure, after being subjected to the pressure cycling test.

Brunswick further commented that some container designs, such as full-wrapped composite containers, would deform
in the axial direction in addition to the circumferential direction. To account for axial deformation, Brunswick
recommended allowing a maximum five percent volumetric expansion of the container.
 Brunswick stated that this test is used to assure that the container material exhibits elastic behavior at expected
operating conditions.





NHTSA agrees with Brunswick's statement that some container designs deform in the axial direction. Nevertheless,
the agency believes that measuring volumetric expansion would not provide an appropriate measure of a container's
impending failure in a destructive test (i.e., where the container cannot be used again). In addition, the NPRM provided
no notice to amend the standard to measure such expansion in the axial direction. Since the pressure cycling and burst
tests being adopted in this rule are capable of evaluating a CNG container's durability, the agency believes that
another non-destructive test would be redundant and therefore is not needed. The agency further notes that the five
percent maximum level of expansion would not provide a meaningful measure of a container's impending failure, since
this level is based on a container's performance under less stringent test conditions.



D. Burst Test



1. Safety Factor



With respect to the burst test, NHTSA proposed that a CNG fuel container would have to withstand an internal hydrostatic
pressure of 3.50 times the service pressure for 60 seconds, without any leakage or circumferential deformation over
one percent. The multiple of the internal hydrostatic pressure, 3.50, is known as the safety factor. The agency tentatively
concluded that the burst test, together with a pressure cycling test, would be sufficient to assure adequate levels
of safety performance for both the strength and durability of CNG fuel containers used in motor vehicles.

The proposal of a burst test with a safety factor was based in part on NGV2. NGV2 specifies several sets of detailed material
and design requirements. For each set of those requirements, NGV2 specifies a unique safety factor for calculating
the internal hydrostatic pressure that the container must withstand. The safety factors range from 2.25 to 3.50,
depending on the material and design involved. To satisfy this aspect of NGV2, a container must meet both the material
and design requirements as well as the burst test.

NGV2 specifies four types of container designs. A Type 1 container is a metallic noncomposite container. A Type 2 container
is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a hoop wrapped pattern over
the liner's cylinder sidewall. A Type 3 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or
fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. A Type 4 container is a non-metallic
liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire
liner, including the domes.

The agency did not propose adoption of the material and design requirements of NGV2. Instead, the agency proposed
a single safety factor of 3.50 for all containers, regardless of their materials or design. It tentatively concluded
that the factor would not impede technological development, yet would assure an acceptable level of safety for all
containers.

CNG container manufacturers, CNG trade associations (NGVC and AGA), utility companies, the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA) and other commenters addressed the issue of the safety factor. Most commenters
disagreed with the agency's proposal to require that all containers meet the same safety factor.

NGVC, AGA, and the CNG container manufacturers generally believed that the material and design of the fuel container
need to be taken into account in establishing an appropriate safety factor, if safe, cost-effective, and light-weight
containers are to be produced. Establishing an overly high factor for a given combination of material and design could
result in unnecessarily over-designed, heavy containers, according to these commenters. They believed that some
materials, such as fiberglass, need a higher safety factor because they degrade faster over time. In contrast, a material
such as steel maintains its strength for a longer time, and therefore containers made of it could be made safely with
a lower safety factor.

Many of these commenters recommended that NHTSA adopt the safety factors specified in NGV2. They stated that compared
to the regulations proposed by NHTSA, the NGVC voluntary industry standard provides a more appropriate level of safety,
given the need to specify safety factors based on the design and materials used.

However, several commenters disagreed with certain safety 
factors specified in NGV2. CGA, PST, SCI, and NGV Systems 
supported a higher safety factor for containers using unproven 
materials. In particular, they were concerned with containers 
reinforced with carbon fiber overwrap, for which NGV2 specifies a 
2.25 safety factor for all carbon reinforced containers, Types 2, 
3, and 4. 
NGV Systems stated that a safety factor of 2.25 constitutes 
an ``unacceptable safety risk,'' given the industry's limited 
experience with carbon fiber and lack of a significant data base 
demonstrating this materials safety and reliability. 
Accordingly, NGV Systems supported a safety factor of 3.5 for 
what it termed unproven designs, which may then be lowered as 
more experience and data accumulate. CGA recommended safety 
factors of 2.5 for all Type 2 containers and 3.33 for all Type 3 
and 4 containers, stating that these are used on all fiber 
reinforced compressed gas containers now in commercial use. CGA 
indicated that unlike other fiber overwrap used in the past for 
transportation pressure vessels, there is no commercial 
experience with the safety of carbon fiber reinforced containers 
for motor vehicle applications to justify a 2.25 safety factor 
for such containers. CGA stated that NGV2 does not adequately 
address damage tolerance concerns for carbon reinforced fully 
wrapped containers with low safety factors. PST recommended 3.33 
for carbon fiber Types 3 and 4 containers. That commenter 
recommended such conservative safety factors until substantial 
data are accumulated on the use of carbon fiber containers in 
actual service. SCI provided similar comments, and recommended 
safety factors of 3.33 for the fully wrapped containers, which 
are Types 3 and 4. 
Three commenters stated that a single safety factor was 
appropriate. CNG Pittsburgh, a consulting firm, stated that a 
safety factor of 3.50 is conservative but reasonable for CNG fuel 
containers. AAMA stated that adopting NGV2's approach with 
various safety factors depending on the material and design 
involved would limit a manufacturer's choice of container designs 
and materials. EDO recommended a safety factor of 2.5 for all 
containers. 
NHTSA decided to issue an SNPRM proposing to pattern the 
burst requirement more closely on NGV2, based on its consultation 
with other Federal agencies, its review of comments to the 
January 1993 proposal, and other available information. In 
explaining its reason for issuing the SNPRM, NHTSA stated that 
there did not appear to be any procedures that could adequately 
test a container's susceptibility to degradation over time. 
Therefore, it believed that specifying a single safety factor 
would not protect in all instances against these problems since 
the strength of some containers is dependent on the specific 
material and method of design. Therefore, NHTSA decided to 
propose a burst test that would link the use of particular 
designs and materials to compliance with safety factors tailored 
to those designs and materials. The agency tentatively concluded 
that such an approach might be necessary to ensure the safe 
performance of pressure vessels used for fuel containers. The 
agency further noted that international standards addressing CNG 
fuel containers, including regulations of Transport Canada and 
those being drafted by the International Standards Organization 
(ISO) link the use of particular designs and materials with 
strength requirements suitable for those designs and materials. 
In the SNPRM, NHTSA requested comment on the appropriateness 
of requiring CNG containers to meet design and material 
requirements, such as those specified in NGV2, and to meet safety 
factors tailored to those requirements. The agency also asked 
about the effect of adopting NGV2 on future container technology, 
since the only way a container manufacturer could comply with the 
Federal standard would be by producing a container that uses 
those materials and designs specified in NGV2 if the agency 
incorporated NGV2's material and design provisions in the FMVSS. 
As an alternative approach, the agency asked whether it should 
specify a catch-all high end safety factor for any container 
whose design and materials are not specified in NGV2. 
NHTSA received 18 comments to the December 1993 SNPRM about 
adopting the design and material specific approach of NGV2. 
Sixteen commenters, including NGVC/AGA, CGA, CNG container 
manufacturers, public utilities, and two bus manufacturers 
supported the proposal to incorporate NGV2 into the Federal 
standard. Eleven commenters supported the safety factors in 
NGV2. Five others were concerned about the level of some safety 
factors in NGV2 or the use of relatively new materials, such as 
carbon fiber. CGA and SCI referenced their earlier comments to 
the NPRM, again recommending safety factors of 2.5 for all Type 2 
containers and 3.33 for all Type 3 and Type 4 containers. AAMA 
and Ford opposed the design and material specific approach of 
NGV2. AAMA stated that some of NGV2's requirements limit 
opportunities for future development of advance container design 
or materials that may not fit in the specifications in NGV2. No 
commenter favored having a catch-all high end safety factor. 
Based on the available information, NHTSA has decided to 
require CNG containers to meet the safety factors applicable to 
the design and material requirements specified in NGV2, except 
for carbon fiber. Specifically, the agency is specifying 
separate safety factors for containers using various materials 
(e.g., fiberglass, carbon, steel, aluminum) and different designs 
(non-composite, hoop wrapped or full wrapped composite 
containers, and welded). The agency believes that this approach 
will result in the manufacture of safe containers for CNG powered 
vehicles. 
NHTSA has decided to adopt the specific safety factors and 
related requirements set forth in NGV2, except for those safety 
factors specified for carbon fiber. While NGV2 currently 
specifies a safety factor of 2.25 for Type 2, 3, and 4 carbon 
fiber containers, NHTSA has decided to specify a safety factor of 
2.5 for Type 2 carbon fiber containers and 3.33 for the Type 3 
and 4 carbon fiber containers. The agency is requiring a higher 
safety factor for Type 3 and 4 containers since the fibers on 
those containers carry a greater proportion of the load than on 
Type 2 containers. 
NHTSA made this decision after reviewing all of the comments 
and information obtained in response to both the NPRM and SNPRM; 
meetings with container manufacturers, CGA and NGVC/AGA; and 
discussions with other Federal agencies, including RSPA. 
Comments and information were presented to support safety factors 
for carbon fiber containers, ranging from 2.25 to 3.5. 
Brunswick, in particular, submitted substantial test data and 
other technical information in support of NGV2's 2.25 safety 
factor for carbon fiber, including testing it performed on such 
containers which showed favorable results. RSPA recommended a 
safety factor of not less than 3.0 for carbon fiber, which is 
consistent with its FRP-1 and FRP-2 standards.

Notwithstanding comments supporting the 2.25 safety factor, 
NHTSA has determined that under its statutory mandate, it is 
necessary to specify higher safety factors for carbon fiber 
containers. In adopting these more stringent requirements, NHTSA 
sought the advice of RSPA, which has accumulated significant 
experience and expertise through its efforts to regulate the 
safety of pressure vessels used to transport hazardous materials. 
Specifically, NHTSA has adopted RSPA's recommendation not to 
specify the 2.25 safety factor for carbon composite containers. 
The more stringent safety factors being adopted are consistent 
with RSPA's longstanding approach to initially adopt conservative 
requirements and subsequently modify the requirements, if further 
real-world safety data become available supporting less stringent 
regulations. NHTSA has determined that applying this approach to 
the safety factors for carbon fiber containers is necessary, 
since carbon fiber containers have not been used extensively in 
motor vehicle applications. The agency believes that the higher 
safety factors are justified until further data are developed and 
become available on the use of carbon fiber containers in motor 
vehicle applications. 
NHTSA acknowledges that using such a safety-oriented 
approach may result in costlier and heavier carbon fiber 
containers. However, the agency believes that the requirements 
being adopted will not preclude the introduction and effective 
use of this new technology. Overall, the agency believes that 
the safety factors being specified for carbon fiber containers, 
along with the remaining safety factors it has adopted from NGV2 
for other materials, will result in safe CNG containers. 
As for AAMA's comment, NHTSA shares that association's 
concerns about restricting future developments. However, based 
on comments by the container manufacturers and other Federal 
agencies, the agency believes that few, if any, designs beyond 
those accounted for in NGV2 are planned. If a new container 
technology is developed, the agency will evaluate its safety in 
the context of a petition for rulemaking to amend the Federal 
safety standard. 
NHTSA has decided not to adopt the catch-all high level 
safety factor, which could allow containers incorporating 
materials or designs that have not been incorporated in NGV2 and 
thus might be detrimental to safety. The agency further believes 
that it would be inappropriate, at this time, to add a catchall 
factor. While such a proviso would facilitate innovation and 
design change, the agency agrees with commenters that specifying 
such a catchall might be detrimental to safety, since untested 
designs and materials would be permitted. 


2. Hold Time Interval 


In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that during the burst test, 
elevated pressure would have to be sustained for 60 seconds. The 
agency noted that while RSPA regulations also specify a 60-second 
period, NGV2 requires a 10-second hold time interval once the 
maximum pressure is obtained. The agency believed that because 
NGV2 includes additional tests to qualify container designs and 
the agency was not proposing these additional tests, a shorter 
hold time would not be suitable. 
NHTSA received six comments addressing the appropriate hold 
time interval. All commenters except EDO believed the 60 second 
hold time requirement was not necessary. EDO stated that the 
requirement was ``tough but reasonable.'' NGVC, Brunswick, PST, 
and ARC stated that specifying the hold time at 60 seconds 
instead of 10 seconds would not compensate for the lack of other 
NGV2 required tests. NGVC stated that the ten second hold time 
interval is not intended as a test of container strength, but as 
the time for the pressure in the container to stabilize. PST 
stated that along with the 3.5 safety factor, the 60 second hold 
time would make an already conservative test even more stringent. 
After reviewing the comments and other available 
information, NHTSA has decided to specify a hold time of 10 
seconds instead of 60 seconds. The agency notes that the 
proposal was based on a misperception of the hold time 
requirement's purpose. As the commenters stated, the hold period 
is included only to stabilize the pressure. It is not used as a 
surrogate for initial burst strength. Therefore, the reduction 
in hold time will not affect the test's stringency. In addition, 
the agency anticipates issuing a SNPRM that would propose 
additional performance requirements to evaluate other aspects of 
a CNG fuel container's integrity. 


3. Sequential Testing 


In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that a container that passed the 
pressure cycling test would then be subjected to the burst test. 
In proposing that the same fuel container be used in both the 
pressure cycling and burst tests, the agency believed that it 
would be appropriate to establish that the fuel container 
maintained its initial strength after being subject to the 
durability test. 
Seven commenters addressed the issue of using the same 
container for both the pressure cycling and burst tests. NGVC, 
AAMA, Comdyne, Pressed Steel Tanks, and Amoco stated that 
requiring the same fuel container for both tests would be 
unrealistic and overly stringent, because in real world 
situations, a container would not be subject to pressure cycling 
and burst conditions sequentially. They stated that otherwise 
unnecessary material would have to be added to strengthen the 
container so it could meet the burst test requirement after the 
pressure cycling test. These commenters believed such additional 
material would significantly increase the container's cost and 
weight to the extent that the container would no longer be 
economically viable to produce. They further stated that most 
containers that are currently produced to meet NGV2 or RSPA 
requirements would not be able to meet this requirement. In 
contrast, EDO and Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority (MSBA) 
favored the use of sequential testing. 
After reviewing the comments and other available 
information, NHTSA has decided not to require sequential testing. 
The agency believes that using different containers in the 
pressure cycling and burst tests will provide an adequate measure 
of both the container's initial strength and its durability over 
its life, without imposing new cost burdens on the industry. The 
agency notes that such testing is consistent with the way in 
which industry currently tests under both NGV2 and RSPA 
standards. The agency further notes that in testing for 
compliance with some FMVSSs, the agency allows a manufacturer to 
use a separate vehicle or component for different tests within a 
standard. For example, three vehicles are crashed in Standard 
No. 301, and different brake hoses are used for various tests in 
Standard No. 106, 

Brake Hoses. 


4. Failure Criteria 


In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that to pass the burst test, a 
container would have to meet the same two performance criteria as 
in the pressure cycling test: (1) No leakage, and (2) no 
permanent circumferential deformation of more than one percent. 
The purpose of these requirements was to provide objective means 
to evaluate a container's compliance strength. NGV2 includes the 
no leakage criterion, but not the one percent circumferential 
deformation criterion. As explained in the section on the 
pressure cycling test, the deformation requirement was based on 
SAE Recommended Practice J10, August 1985, which addresses the 
performance of metal air brake reservoirs. The agency proposed a 
circumferential deformation limit to aid in determining a 
container's impending failure. 
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA is adopting the no 
leakage criterion to evaluate failure of the burst test. The 
agency has decided not to adopt the one percent deformation 
criterion because the agency believes that circumferential 
deformation is not a meaningful measure of a fuel container's 
impending failure in the burst test. See the section above 
regarding the pressure cycling test for a more comprehensive 
discussion about the agency's decision not to adopt the pressure 
deformation criterion.

E. Bonfire Test 


1. Performance Requirements 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed performance requirements for CNG 
fuel containers to address the need to withstand high 
temperatures and pressures without catastrophic failure. Large 
pressure increases due to exposure to flames could cause the CNG 
to escape catastrophically and result in an explosive fire. The 
agency proposed that the ability to withstand high temperatures 
and pressures be provided by a pressure relief device. More 
specifically, it proposed that compliance would be determined by 
first pressurizing the fuel container to 100 percent of service 
pressure with nitrogen or air and placing it over a bonfire until 
the container's contents are completely vented through a pressure 
relief device. A pressure relief device can prevent a container 
from experiencing high pressure for long periods of time. The 
agency proposed a second test to be conducted in the same manner, 
except the container would be pressurized to 25 percent of the 
service pressure. The second test would evaluate container 
performance when containers are partially filled. The purpose of 
the test is to reduce the explosion potential of CNG containers 
when exposed to high temperatures and pressures. 

The proposed requirements were based on NGV2. However, 
there were two differences between the agency's proposal and 
NGV2. First, under the NPRM, the container would be pressurized 
with nitrogen or air; in NGV2, it is pressurized by CNG. Second, 
under the NPRM, all fuel containers would be required to use a 
pressure relief device to completely vent the container's 
contents; in NGV2, the test is run for 20 minutes or until the 
container is completely vented, whichever comes first. 
Therefore, under NGV2, a manufacturer could establish compliance 
either by a container successfully withstanding the test 
conditions for 20 minutes without bursting or by completely 
venting its contents by means of a pressure relief device at some 
point during that 20 minute period. In the NPRM, the agency 
sought comment about whether to allow an alternative way of 
demonstrating compliance with the bonfire test that did not 
depend upon a pressure relief device. Under the alternative, a 
container would be considered to have passed the test if it did 
not burst during the test period. Compliance with the 
alternative would be achieved by designing a container so that it 
has sufficient strength to enable it to sustain the heat and 
pressure buildup during the test. 

Eleven commenters addressed the issue of whether containers 
should be required to have a pressure relief device. NGVC, EDO, 
ARC, Flxible, Manchester, Thomas, and MSBA agreed with the 
proposal to require containers to be equipped with such a device. 
They stated that a pressure relief device is an integral part of 
a CNG container and that its importance warrants a requirement 
that each container have one. In contrast, Brunswick, Comdyne, 
Pressure Technology, and AAMA stated that containers should not 
be required to have a pressure relief device because such a 
requirement would be design restrictive. Brunswick and Pressure 
Technology stated that the container should be required to 
``safely vent'' its contents without rupturing, whether the venting 
is done through a pressure relief device or the container wall. 
AAMA stated that a container should pass the requirement if it 
possesses enough strength to retain its contents throughout the 
test. ARC believed that the container sidewalls should not be 
permitted to rupture during the bonfire test. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has determined that each 
CNG container must be equipped with a pressure relief device. 
This is necessary because each CNG fuel container needs to 
possess a means of releasing its contents in case the internal 
pressure or temperature reaches a dangerous level. By requiring 
containers to be equipped with a pressure relief device, the 
agency will ensure the safety of individuals, such as vehicle 
occupants and rescue personnel, who would be near a CNG vehicle 
in a fire. The agency notes that the conditions experienced in 
the bonfire test may be less severe than certain real-world crash 
situations. Therefore, the agency is adopting a more 
conservative approach and requiring a pressure relief device for 
all containers. In addition, such a requirement is consistent 
with the practice of most container manufacturers and NGV2 which 
requires such a device on all containers. 

Based on the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt NGV2's 
test criteria that allows the test to be completed after 20 
minutes or when the container has completely vented, whichever 
comes first. Adopting these criteria alters the test in that 
while still requiring a pressure relief device, a container could 
comply with the bonfire test if it either completely vents its 
contents by means of a pressure relief device at some point 
during that 20 minute period or by successfully retaining the 
container's entire contents without bursting for the duration of 
the bonfire test (i.e., 20 minutes). The agency believes that 
each criterion appropriately measures a container's ability to 
withstand high temperature and pressure because the bonfire test 
represents extreme conditions. The agency emphasizes that in 
either case the CNG container must be equipped with a pressure 
relief device. 

NHTSA disagrees with the approach advocated by AAMA, 
Brunswick and Pressure Technology to allow containers to ``safely 
vent'' their contents from an area other than the pressure relief 
device such as the sidewall. The agency acknowledges that, as an 
alternative to a pressure relief device, pressure relief can be 
accomplished by allowing the overpressurized container to vent 
its contents at a controlled rate, without fragmentation, through 
the container's sidewall. However, there would be significant 
problems with this approach. First, it would not afford as high 
a degree of safety as requiring a pressure relief device. The 
agency continues to believe that the safest way to release CNG 
from an overpressurized container is through a pressure relief 
device because some sidewall ruptures could result in fragments 
being propelled from the container. Second, it would raise 
potential enforceability problems since the concepts of ``release 
its contents at a controlled rate'' and ``rupture without 
fragmentation'' are difficult to define objectively. Based on the 
above considerations, NHTSA has decided to require each CNG fuel 
container to either completely vent its contents through a 
pressure relief device or not burst when tested in accordance 
with the test conditions. 



2. Types of Pressure Relief Devices 



The proposal did not specify the use of a particular type of 
pressure relief device. The agency is aware of three types of 
devices currently being used: (1) The rupture disc, which is 
designed to release CNG in the container when it reaches a 
specific pressure, (2) the fusible plug, which is designed to 
release CNG in the container when it reaches a specific 
temperature, and (3) a device that combines these two devices.

<TEXT>
 

Four commenters recommended the use of specific types of 
pressure relief devices. EDO recommended that the agency require 
the fusible plug device and prohibit the rupture disc device. 
EDO stated that a combination of hot conditions and overfill at 
the refueling pump could cause a rupture disc to activate, 
releasing CNG and causing a potentially dangerous situation. It 
further believed that the safety factor in the burst test would 
be sufficient to prevent over pressurization and that the 
pressure relief device should only open in a fire situation. 
Flxible stated that the agency should require a fusible plug to 
ensure pressure relief of partially filled containers subject to 
heat or fire. NYCFD stated that the agency should prohibit the 
combination fusible plug and rupture disc devices, claiming that 
over-charged containers exposed to high ambient temperature are 
likely to fail whether or not they are exposed to fire. Thomas 
commented that the agency should require the combination fusible 
plug and rupture disc device because it is required by NFPA 52.
 





After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has concluded that the 
standard should not specify the type of pressure relief device 
with which a container may be equipped. The NPRM and SNPRM did 
not provide sufficient notice for the agency to adopt such a 
specification as part of this final rule. Further, the agency 
believes that the bonfire test, which is performed at both 100 
percent of service pressure and 25 percent of service pressure, 
will adequately evaluate a container's ability to vent its 
contents in a high temperature/pressure situation. In the first 
test, the combination of the 100 percent service pressure 
condition and the high heat from the bonfire will cause the 
container's pressure to increase rapidly. This test evaluates a 
container's ability to vent its contents at high temperatures and 
pressures. In the second test, the 25 percent service pressure 
condition and the heat will cause the container's temperature to 
increase before the pressure in the container reaches a critical 
point. This test evaluates a container's ability to vent its 
contents at high temperatures, where the container is at a less 
than full condition. 



3. Shielding 



NHTSA notes that there are two types of shielding that can 
affect the performance of pressure relief devices in bonfire 
tests: (1) ``Vehicle-based protective shielding'' that is placed 
around the container in the vehicle to protect the container from 
surrounding heat, and (2) ``test shielding'' that is placed over 
the pressure relief device to prevent flames from contacting the 
device. Test shielding is, as the name suggests, installed only 
for the purpose of conducting bonfire tests. Unlike vehicle-based protective shielding, it is not used to affect
real world 
performance. 

In the NPRM, NHTSA recognized that some CNG vehicles may 
have vehicle-based shielding installed to protect the containers 
from exposure to heat. Nevertheless, the agency proposed that no 
vehicle-based shielding be used during the bonfire test because 
Standard No. 304 is an equipment standard, and applies to CNG 
containers, not to vehicles. Further, since the presence or 
amount of shielding could vary from vehicle to vehicle, the 
agency tentatively concluded that the containers should be tested 
in the worst case situation, i.e., without any vehicle-based 
shielding. Nevertheless, the agency stated that it did not want 
to discourage vehicle manufacturers from including shielding in 
CNG vehicles as an added safety feature. 

NHTSA received six comments addressing the use of vehicle-
based shielding during the bonfire test. PST, EDO, ARC, Ontario, 
and NGVC agreed with the agency that vehicle-based shielding of 
the container should not be used during the bonfire test. They 
believed that such shielding could detract from or mask the 
results of the test. In contrast, AAMA stated that ``[i]f a 
manufacturer chooses to add the additional expense to protect the 
fuel tank from exposure to potential flame, the protection ought 
to be allowed in any test as representative of the tank's use in 
the vehicle.'' 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to 
permit vehicle-based shielding of the container during the 
bonfire test. As explained in the NPRM, the bonfire test is 
intended to evaluate the container and not the vehicle. Since 
this is an equipment standard, the tests are designed to ensure 
that the containers are safe for installation in any vehicle, 
regardless of the amount of protective vehicle shielding, if any, 
with which it is equipped. The agency disagrees with AAMA's 
contention. Using vehicle shielding in compliance testing would 
not ensure that a container could perform safely under worst case 
conditions (i.e., no vehicle-based shielding of any type or 
extent) that the container could encounter during its service 
life (e.g., if the container is subsequently placed in a 
different vehicle). 

Test shielding consists of a metal plate over the pressure 
relief device and is permitted, but not required, under NGV2 for 
purposes of the horizontal bonfire test. In the horizontal test, 
the CNG container is positioned over the bonfire with its 
longitudinal axis in a horizontal position. In the NGV2 vertical 
bonfire test (container longitudinal axis in a vertical 
position), pressure relief device shielding is also permitted, 
but not required, except where the CNG container is fitted with a 
pressure relief device on both ends. In that case, the bottom 
pressure relief device must be shielded. The goal is to not 
allow flames to impinge directly on any relief device. This may 
be done through test shielding, or by orienting the container so 
as to avoid flame impingement on any pressure relief device. 
Without this metal plate, the flames could contact the pressure 
relief device, possibly causing it to vent the container 
prematurely. If this occurred, the bonfire test results would 
neither evaluate the CNG container as a whole nor accurately 
reflect the container's pressure relief characteristics. 

CGA and PST opposed allowing shielding of the pressure 
relief device during the bonfire test. They commented that 
shielding the pressure relief device during the bonfire test 
would not be representative of a real-world crash fire situation. 
CGA stated that allowing, but not requiring shielding to be 
placed around pressure relief devices could produce non- 
repeatable results. PST stated that excessive shielding around 
the pressure relief device could cause an otherwise acceptable 
design to fail the test, but did not elaborate as to how this 
could occur.

NHTSA has decided to require test shielding of the pressure 
relief device during the horizontal bonfire test. The agency 
notes that the purpose of this test is to replicate the effect of 
fires on the pressure relief device and the fuel container as a 
system. Requiring shielding will assure that the bonfire test is 
evaluating the fuel container as a whole, rather than merely the 
pressure relief device, since a flame that impinges on the 
pressure relief device, could activate prematurely. Requiring 
shielding, rather than simply allowing it, will assure repeatable 
and consistent test results. The rule also requires shielding of 
the pressure relief device during the vertical bonfire test, 
except where the container is fitted with a pressure relief 
device on only one end. In that case, the container is 
positioned with the pressure relief device on top, so as to avoid 
direct contact with the flame. 


4. Test Gas and Pressure 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the CNG container be 
pressurized with either nitrogen or air to 100 percent of service 
pressure for the bonfire test. The agency acknowledged that NGV2 
specifies the use of CNG, but tentatively concluded that using 
nitrogen or air as the test gas would be safer than using CNG. 

AAMA and Tecogen recommended that CNG be used as the test 
gas. Tecogen further commented that the container manufacturers 
have historically conducted such tests using CNG and are 
therefore well aware of the necessary safety precautions. It 
further stated that using CNG as the test gas would reveal the 
pressure relief valve's effectiveness with respect to the 
discharge rate. AAMA commented that CNG should be used as the 
test gas because the thermal properties of CNG differ from those 
of nitrogen and air and NGV2 specifies the use of CNG as the test 
gas. AAMA also recommended that the CNG containers be 
pressurized at the start of the test to 95 to 100 percent of 
service pressure, but offered no rationale. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has determined that 
using CNG as the test gas would better reflect the real-world 
conditions in a fire, since the test gas would be the same as the 
gas used in CNG containers. The agency notes that the bonfire 
test addresses the responsiveness of the pressure relief device 
and that air and nitrogen have different thermal properties than 
CNG. Therefore, the pressure relief device might perform 
differently if air or nitrogen were used instead of CNG. In the 
NPRM, the agency explained that using CNG as a test gas might not 
be safe. These initial concerns have been allayed by the 
comments indicating that manufacturers are aware of and 
accustomed to taking the necessary safety precautions when using 
CNG as a test gas to evaluate a container. NHTSA notes that it 
decided not to specify CNG as the test gas in the CNG vehicle 
standard. Nevertheless, the agency believes that differences in 
reaction to heat are important for the bonfire test, which 
involves high temperatures, but not for crash tests, which do not 
involve such temperatures. 

NHTSA continues to believe that it is necessary to 
pressurize the CNG container to 100 percent of service pressure 
at the outset of the test. The agency has determined that the 
containers need to be tested at full service pressure to 
represent the worst case scenario. 



5. Wind Velocity and Direction 



In the NPRM and SNPRM, NHTSA did not address the allowable 
wind velocity and direction. The agency received comments from 
NGVC, CGA, and PST stating that a limit should be placed on wind 
velocity to increase the bonfire test's repeatability. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to specify 
that the average wind velocity at the container during the test 
may not exceed 2.24 meters per second (5 mph). The agency 
believes that permitting higher crosswinds would vary or reduce 
the flame's heat. Therefore, placing limits on the crosswind 
assures the test's repeatability and the level of stringency that 
the agency anticipated in proposing this test. 



6. Bonfire Fuel 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the fire for the bonfire 
tests be generated using No. 2 diesel fuel. This fuel type was 
proposed so that the standard would be consistent with the 
bonfire test in NGV2, which also specifies this type of fuel. 

NGVC, CGA, AAMA, and Norris commented that the agency should 
specify a different fuel to generate the bonfire that is more 
environmentally sound. CGA stated that the large amounts of 
smoke that would be created by burning the diesel fuel are 
contrary to the environmental objectives of developing CNG 
vehicles. NGVC and Norris suggested using a CNG or propane grill 
for the test. 

After reviewing the comments and other available 
information, NHTSA has decided to specify the use of No. 2 diesel 
fuel in the final rule. The agency is aware of the environmental 
problems associated with this type of fuel and will further study 
whether other fuels should be used to generate the bonfire test. 
However, until the agency can determine that a different fuel is 
an appropriate replacement for diesel fuel, the Standard will 
specify No. 2 diesel fuel for use in the bonfire test. 



7. Bonfire Test Fuel Pan Depth 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the bonfire test pan 
containing No. 2 diesel fuel be at least 100 centimeters (cm) 
deep. The agency specified a depth to ensure that there would be 
an adequate amount of fuel to run the test. 

AAMA, Comdyne, CGA, Alusuisse, and PST commented that the 
fuel pan depth was excessive. Alusuisse stated that a pan of the 
proposed size would contain more than 1,000 liters of fuel. PST 
stated that a 100 millimeter (mm) depth would be more reasonable. 
CGA, AAMA, and Comdyne stated that the depth of the fuel pan 
should not be specified so long as a sufficient quantity of fuel 
is provided for the test. 

The agency intended to propose a depth of 100 mm. However, 
due to a typographical error, it proposed a depth of 100 cm. 
NHTSA agrees that a fuel pan with a depth of at least 100 cm 
would be too deep. NHTSA also agrees that the fuel pan's depth 
does not need to be specified, provided that there is a 
sufficient amount of fuel to maintain the fire for the duration 
of the test. Accordingly, the agency has removed the requirement 
for fuel pan depth and has replaced it with the provision that 
 there be ``sufficient fuel to burn for at least 20 minutes.'' 
The agency believes that this provision is consistent with the 
test's purpose of simulating a severe fire by raising the 
container's temperature and pressure by completely surrounding it 
with flames produced by a specific fuel type. 



F. Labeling Requirements 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that container 
manufacturers certify that each of their containers complies with 
the proposed equipment requirements and permanently label the 
container with the following information: the symbol ``DOT'' to 
constitute a certification by the manufacturer that the container 
conforms to all requirements of the standard; the date of 
manufacture of the container; the name and address of the 
container manufacturer; and the maximum service pressure. The 
agency stated that labeling the container would provide vehicle 
manufacturers and consumers with assurance that they are 
purchasing containers that comply with the Federal safety 
standards. In addition, the agency believed that the proposed 
requirement would facilitate the agency's enforcement efforts by 
providing a ready means of identifying the container and its 
manufacturer.

<DOCNO> FR940926-0-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940926-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EDO, NGVC, Thomas, NYCFD, and Volvo GM addressed the 
proposed labeling requirements. EDO and NYCFD stated that the 
label should include the maximum fill pressure at a location 
close to the fill receptacle. NGVC recommended that a blank area 
for the container installation date be included in the label to 
be filled in by the installer. Volvo GM stated that only 
containers that are manufactured after the standard's effective 
date, and therefore actually subject to the standard, should be 
entitled to display the DOT symbol as certification of compliance 
with the standard. Thomas stated, without elaboration, that the 
labeling requirements of NGV2 should be adopted. NHTSA's 
proposal did not include certain additional information included 
in NGV2, including the type of container, inspector symbols, 
trademarks, manufacturer's part number, and serial numbers. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt the 
proposed labeling requirements with a slight modification from 
the proposed format. In item (a), the agency has modified the 
proposal which states ``The tank manufacturer's name and address'' 
to state the following: include the statement that ``If there is a 
question about the proper use, installation, or maintenance of 
this container, contact [

manufacturer's name, address, and 
telephone number

].'' 

The agency has decided not to require the other additional 
items of information in NGV2 since the agency did not propose the 
inclusion of such information in the NPRM. Notwithstanding the 
agency's decision not to require this additional information, a 
manufacturer may list such information on the label, provided the 
additional information does not obscure or confuse the required 
information. In particular, NHTSA encourages manufacturers to 
include the container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4, since the 
agency has decided to adopt NGV2's design and material 
specifications in this final rule. Specifying the type of 
container should facilitate oversight of compliance tests since 
each type of container is required to undergo hydrostatic burst 
tests, but with different safety factors. 

In the upcoming SNPRM, NHTSA anticipates proposing 
additional requirements about the CNG fuel container's label, 
including the container type. In addition, the agency 
anticipates proposing that the label include an additional 
statement addressing the container's inspection and maintenance. 
Specifically, the label would state that ``This container should 
be visually inspected after an accident or fire or at least every 
12 months for damage and deterioration in accordance with the 
applicable Compressed Gas Association guidelines.'' The agency 
believes that such a statement would alert owners to the 
desirability for reinspection over time or in the event of an 
accident. NHTSA will also propose requirements related to the 
label's location, in response to EDO's and NYCFD's comment that 
the maximum service pressure should be labeled in an area close 
to the fill receptacle. 



G. Leadtime 



In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to make the equipment 
requirements effective on September 1, 1994. The agency believed 
that this would provide a reasonable time period for 
manufacturers to make minor modifications in container design. 
This proposal was based on the agency's belief that the proposed 
requirements were similar to RSPA standards currently in effect. 
The agency requested comment on the feasibility of this effective 
date. 

NHTSA received eleven comments about the proposed effective 
date applicable to the container requirements. The commenters 
were TMC, the U.S. Department of Energy, TBB, Oklahoma Gas, NGVC, 
EDO, Volvo/GM, AAMA, ARC, Navistar, and NGV Systems. EDO and 
Navistar requested that the final rule be issued as early as 
possible. DOE and Oklahoma Gas recommended an effective date of 
September 1, 1995. NGVC recommended an effective date of 
September 1, 1996, unless NGV2 were adopted which would permit an 
immediate supply of containers. NGV Systems stated that an 

earlier effective date would be difficult to meet since the rule, 
as proposed, would require new tooling, process development, and 
perhaps equipment modification. ARC stated that the rule, as 
proposed, would require major modifications, since its containers 
have been designed to comply with NGV2. AAMA and Volvo/GM stated 
that the effective dates for the vehicle requirements and the 
equipment requirements should not be concurrent. 

NHTSA notes that these comments were based on the 
requirements, as proposed in the NPRM. Since the final rule has 
been made essentially consistent with NGV2 (with the exception of 
carbon fiber containers), the agency anticipates that container 
manufacturers can for the most part already certify that 
containers, other than carbon fiber ones, comply with the new 
standard. This belief is based on comments on the NPRM and 
meetings with NGVC, the CGA, and CNG container manufacturers. 
With regard to manufacturers of carbon fiber containers, EDO 
indicated that it already complies with the standard and 
Brunswick indicated that it would need less than one month lead 
time for a safety factor greater than 2.25. Brunswick further 
stated that it would need an unspecified time period to modify 
the mounting brackets and other hardware. The CNG industry 
groups have informed the agency that they want a CNG fuel 
container standard to be effective as quickly as possible. In 
addition, they favor having an opportunity to ``voluntarily 
certify compliance'' to the standard once the final rule is 
published. The CNG industry groups believe that it is necessary 
for Federal standards to be in place as soon as possible, given 
the expected increased demand for CNG containers in light of 
Federal and State fleet programs for clean fuel vehicles. They 
also favor quick adoption of a Federal standard to preempt state 
regulations that otherwise may be promulgated and to ensure that 
substandard CNG containers are not marketed. 

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to 
establish an effective date six months after the final rule is 
issued. As explained above, most CNG containers can be certified 
to comply with the new Federal motor vehicle safety standard 
since they already comply with NGV2 or can be modified so that 
they comply within six months. Nevertheless, the agency believes 
that it is necessary to provide a leadtime of six months to allow 
manufacturers time to make whatever design changes are necessary 
and to conduct testing so that they can certify that their 
containers comply with the new standard. In the meantime, prior 
to the standard's effective date, the industry is free to 
advertise containers as meeting the CNG equipment standard that 
will take effect in six months.
 Manufacturers have taken the 
approach of seeking early compliance with respect to other agency 
requirements such as those relating to dynamic side impact 
protection and air bags. Therefore, the agency encourages 
manufacturers to seek, to the extent feasible, to manufacture 
their CNG containers to meet these new requirements before the 
date the standard takes effect. 





With regard to the concern expressed by AAMA and Volvo GM that the effective date of the container regulation should
precede that of the vehicle regulation, AAMA based its comments on the belief that it will need to know the performance
of the containers it will use in the fuel systems of its vehicles. NHTSA notes that CNG containers now typically meet
NGV2 and thus should comply with NHTSA's standards. Therefore, AAMA members already have access to and detailed knowledge
about containers that should meet the new requirements.

H. Benefits 


In the NPRM, NHTSA addressed the proposal's benefits with 
respect to CNG vehicles. The notice did not directly address the 
benefits of regulating the CNG fuel containers. 
NHTSA received no comments directly addressing the benefits 
of regulating CNG containers. Brunswick criticized the proposal, 
believing that it would place carbon fiber containers at a 
competitive disadvantage. Brunswick stated that the proposed 
single burst factor would provide less benefits than if the 
agency adopted NGV2.





NHTSA anticipates that the number of CNG fuel vehicles will 
increase greatly in the near future, in light of directives by 
the Clinton Administration
 and legislation by Congress to 
develop vehicles powered by cleaner burning fuels. This final 
rule will increase the safety of this growing population of 
vehicles. 




I. Costs 


In the NPRM, NHTSA stated that each container would cost 
$600. The agency further stated that the container testing costs 
would range from approximately $4,050 to $8,600 for each model of 
container. 
NGVC, NGV Systems, PST, Brunswick, ARC, Thomas Built, and 
Flxible addressed the costs of the proposal with respect to CNG 
containers. NGVC and the CNG container manufacturers stated that 
the proposal, especially given the single safety factor in the 
burst test requirements, significantly understated the costs of 
the rulemaking. Brunswick stated that container manufacturers 
would incur significant costs since they would have to redesign 
and requalify their currently designed tanks. As a result, it 
believed that the CNG containers would be more expensive and 
heavier. It estimated that the proposal would increase costs 
between 10 percent and 55 percent, depending on the material and 
method of construction. Brunswick further stated that this 
proposal would add many millions of dollars on an industry-wide 
basis. 
NGVC commented that the qualification tests could cost 
$20,000 for each model of container since many tests will be 
required on prototype containers. It stated that some 
manufacturers estimate that the design, manufacture, and 
qualification costs could approach $150,000 per container model, 
a figure that greatly exceeded NHTSA's estimate of $74,000. 
NHTSA believes that the basis for the comments about the 
costs of this rulemaking have been largely eliminated except in 
connection with carbon fiber tanks. The comments were based on 
the proposal for a single safety factor of 3.5 for all types of 
tanks. As noted above, the agency has decided to specify 
multiple safety factors that are consistent with NGV2 except in 
the case of the factors for carbon fiber containers. Since all 
the container manufacturers commenting on the proposal either 
already certify to or can comply with NGV2 without any design 
changes, the cost to manufacturers will be minimal for noncarbon 
fiber tanks. 


V. Rulemaking Analyses


A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures 


NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action 
under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of 
Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This 
rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, 
``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been 
determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of 
Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has 
estimated the costs of the amendments in a Final Regulatory 
Evaluation (FRE) which is included in the docket for this 
rulemaking. As discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates that 
the cost for the pressure cycling, burst, and bonfire testing 
will range from $9,000 to $21,725 per container size and type. 
In addition, the cost of the containers used in the test is 
estimated to range from $1,800 to $6,600. Since the safety 
factors in the burst test applicable to carbon fiber containers 
are more stringent than those in NGV2, the cost of those 
containers will increase. Based on comments by Brunswick and 
other information, the switch from carbon fiber containers 
meeting a 2.25 safety factor to carbon fiber containers meeting 
the factors adopted in this final rule will increase the 
container cost and the lifetime fuel costs about 8.75 percent for 
vehicles equipped with Type 2 containers. Those costs would be 
range from $115 for passenger cars to $602 for heavy trucks. The 
switch would increase costs about 37.1 percent for vehicles 
equipped with Type 3 and Type 4 containers, resulting in a cost 
increase ranging from $496 for cars to $2,560 for heavy trucks. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking 
action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the 
agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Information available to the agency indicates that 
businesses manufacturing CNG fuel containers are not small 
businesses. 


C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 


NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with 
the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. 
NHTSA has determined that the rule will not have sufficient 
Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. No state has adopted requirements 
regulating CNG containers. 


D. National Environmental Policy Act 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this 
rule. The agency has determined that this rule will have no 
adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. On the 
contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of 
CNG vehicles will encourage their use, NHTSA believes that the 
rule will have positive environmental impacts. CNG vehicles are 
expected to have near-zero evaporative emissions and the 
potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well. 


E. Civil Justice Reform 


This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 
49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard 
is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard 
applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not 
identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the 
State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and 
applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 
30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules 
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety 
standards. That section does not require submission of a 
petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings 
before parties may file suit in court.

3. A new  571.304, 

Standard No. 304; Compressed Natural Gas 
Fuel Container Integrity,

 is added to Part 571, to read as 
follows: 


 571.304 

Standard No. 304; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container 
Integrity. 


S1. 

Scope.

 This standard specifies requirements for the 
integrity of compressed natural gas (CNG), motor vehicle fuel 
containers. 
S2. 

Purpose.

 The purpose of this standard is to reduce 
deaths and injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel 
leakage during and after motor vehicle crashes. 
S3. 

Application.

 This standard applies to containers 
designed to store CNG as motor fuel on-board any motor vehicle. 
S4. 

Definitions. 
Brazing

 means a group of welding processes wherein 
coalescence is produced by heating to a suitable temperature 
above 800 




F and by using a nonferrous filler metal, having a 
melting point below that to the base metals. The filler metal is 
distributed between the closely fitted surfaces of the joint by 
capillary attraction. 


Burst pressure

 means the highest internal pressure reached 
in a CNG fuel container during a burst test at a temperature of 
21 




C (70 




F). 


CNG fuel container

 means a container designed to store CNG 
as motor fuel on-board a motor vehicle. 


Fill pressure

 means the internal pressure of a CNG fuel 
container attained at the time of filling. Fill pressure varies 
according to the gas temperature in the container which is 
dependent on the charging parameters and the ambient conditions. 


Full wrapped

 means applying the reinforcement of a filament 
or resin system over the entire liner, including the domes. 


Hoop wrapped

 means winding of filament in a substantially 
circumferential pattern over the cylindrical portion of the liner 
so that the filament does not transmit any significant stresses 
in a direction parallel to the cylinder longitudinal axis. 


Hydrostatic pressure

 means the internal pressure to which a 
CNG fuel container is taken during testing set forth in S5.4.1. 


Liner

 means the inner gas tight container or gas cylinder to 
which the overwrap is applied. 


Service pressure

 means the internal settled pressure of a 
CNG fuel container at a uniform gas temperature of 21 




C (70 




F) 
and full gas content. It is the pressure for which the container 
has been constructed under normal conditions. 


Stress ratio 

means the stress in the fiber at minimum burst 
pressure divided by the stress in the fiber at service pressure.

S5.7 

Yield strength, tensile strength, material elongation 
(metal containers and metal liners only). 

To determine yield 
strength, tensile strength, and elongation of the material, cut 
two specimens from one container or liner. The specimen either 
has (a) a gauge length of 50 mm (2 inches) and a width not over 
38 mm (1.5 inches), or (b) a gauge length of four times the 
specimen diameter, provided that a gauge length which is at least 
24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the 
thickness is permitted when the liner wall is not over 5 mm (3/16 
inch) thick. The specimen shall not be flattened, except that 
grip ends may be flattened to within 25 mm (1 inch) of each end 
of the reduced section. Heating of specimens is prohibited. 

S5.7.1 

Yield strength. 

The yield strength in tension shall 
be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent 
based on the gauge length. 
S5.7.1.1 The yield strength shall be determined by either 
the ``offset'' method or the ``extension under load'' method as 
prescribed by 

Standard Test Methods for Tension Testing of 
Metallic Materials

, ASTM E8 1993. 

S5.7.1.2 In using the ``extension under load'' method, the 
total strain or ``extension under load'' corresponding to the 
stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be 
determined by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge 
length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of 
the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations shall be based 
on an elastic modulus of 69 GPa (10,000,000 psi) for aluminum, or 
207 GPa (30,000,000 psi) for steel. If the elastic extension 
calculation does not provide a conclusive result, the entire 
stress strain diagram shall be plotted and the yield strength 
determined from the 0.2 percent offset. 

S5.7.1.3 For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial 
strain is set while the test specimen is under a stress of 41 MPa 
(6,000 psi) for aluminum, and 83 MPa (12,000 psi) for steel. The 
strain indicator reading is set at the calculated corresponding 
strain. 

S5.7.1.4 Cross-head speed of the testing machine is 3.2 mm 
(1/8 inch) per minute or less during yield strength 
determination. 

S5.7.2 

Elongation. 

Elongation of material, when tested in 
accordance with S5.7, shall be at least 14 percent for aluminum 
or at least 20 percent for steel; except that an elongation of 10 
percent is acceptable for both aluminum and steel when the 
authorized specimen size is 24t gauge length x 6t wide, where ``t'' 
equals specimen thickness. 

S5.7.3 

Tensile strength. 

Tensile strength shall not exceed 
725 MPa (105,000 psi) for ``Carbon Manganese'' and 966 MPa (140,000 
psi) for ``Chrome-Molybdenum'' and ``Carbon-Boron.''

ACTION:

 Final rule. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for four plants: 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

(no common name (NCN)), 

Ctenitis squamigera

 (pauoa), 

Diplazium molokaiense 

(NCN), and 

Pteris lidgatei 

(NCN). 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare

 is currently known only from the island of Hawaii. The three other species are reported from more than one island: 

Ctenitis squamigera

 is known from the islands of Oahu, Lanai, and Maui, and 

Diplazium molokaiense

 and 

Pteris lidgatei

 are known from Oahu and Maui. The four plant taxa and their habitats have been variously affected or are threatened
by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and/or predation by feral goats, sheep, cattle, axis deer, and
pigs; and competition for space, light, water, and nutrients from alien plants. Because of the small number of extant
individuals and their severely restricted distributions, populations of these taxa are subject to an increased
likelihood of extinction from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection provided by
the Act. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 





Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare, Ctenitis squamigera, Diplazium molokaiense, 

and 

Pteris lidgatei

 are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

is currently known only from the island of Hawaii. 

Ctenitis squamigera

 is known from the islands of Oahu, Lanai, and Maui. 

Diplazium molokaiense

 and 

Pteris lidgatei

 are known from Oahu and Maui. 

The vegetation of the Hawaiian Islands varies greatly according to elevation, moisture regime, and substrate. Major
vegetation formations include forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, herblands, and pioneer associations
on lava and cinder substrates. There are lowland, montane, and subalpine forest types. Coastal and lowland forests
are generally dry or mesic, and may be open- or closed-canopied, with the canopy generally under 10 meters (m) (30 feet
(ft)) in height. Of the four endangered fern taxa, three have been reported from lowland forest habitat. 

Ctenitis squamigera

 is typically found in lowland mesic forests, while 

Pteris lidgatei

 appears to be restricted to lowland wet forest. 

Diplazium molokaiense

 has been reported from lowland to montane forests in mesic to wet settings. Montane forests, occupying elevations
between 1,000 and 2,000 m (3,000 and 6,500 ft) are dry to mesic on the leeward (southwest) slopes of Maui and Hawaii.
On those islands, as well as Oahu and Lanai, mesic to wet montane forests occur on the windward (northeast) slopes and
summits. The dry and mesic forests may be open- to closed-canopied, and may exceed 20 m (65 ft) in stature. 

Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 has been reported from montane mesic and dry forest habitats. 

Diplazium molokaiense

 is also found in montane mesic forests as well as montane wet forests. At high montane and subalpine elevations, above
2,000 m (6,500 ft) elevation, the forests are usually open-canopied, and form a mosaic with surrounding grasslands
and shrublands. Subalpine forests and associated ecosystems are known only from East Maui and the island of Hawaii.


Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

has been reported from subalpine dry forest and shrubland habitat (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). 

The land that supports these four plant taxa is owned by the State of Hawaii, the Federal government, and private entities.
The State lands are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Land and Natural Resources (including the natural
area reserves system, forest reserves, and State parks) and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. Federally owned
land consists of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Pohakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaii, and Schofield Barracks
Military Reservation on Oahu. The latter two are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army. 



Discussion of the Four Taxa 



The Hawaiian plants now referred to as 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

were considered by William Hillebrand (1888) to be conspecific with 

Asplenium fragile

 from Central and South America. The Hawaiian plants were subsequently treated as a distinct endemic species, 

Asplenium rhomboideum

 Brack. (Robinson 1913). However, that species is now considered native to the New World and not present in Hawaii.
The name 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare

 was published in 1947, as the Hawaiian plants were considered distinct at the varietal level from the extra-Hawaiian
plants (Morton 1947).

 a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), is a fern with a short suberect stem. The leaf stalks are 5 to 15 centimeters
(cm) (2 to 6 inches (in)) long. The main axis of the frond is dull gray or brown, with two greenish ridges. The fronds are
thin-textured, bright green, long and narrow, 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in) long, 2 cm (0.8 in) wide above the middle, and pinnate
with 20 to 30 pinnae (leaflets) on each side. The pinnae are rhomboidal, 0.8 cm (0.3 in) wide, and notched into two to
five blunt lobes on the side towards the tip of the frond. The sori (spore-producing bodies) are close to the main vein
of the pinna, with one to two on the lower side and two to four on the upper side (Hillebrand 1888, Wagner and Wagner 1992).
The Hawaiian fern species most similar to 

Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 is 

Asplenium macraei.

 The two can be distinguished by a number of characters, including the size and shape of the pinnae and the number of sori
per pinna (Wagner and Wagner 1992). 



Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 was known historically from East Maui, where it was recorded from the north slope of Haleakala and Kanahau Hill (Hawaii
Heritage Program 1992a6, Hillebrand 1888). On the island of Hawaii, the taxon was found historically below Kalaieha,
Laumaia, and Puu Moana on Mauna Kea (HHP 1992a12, 1992a14, 1992a15), Puuwaawaa on Hualalai (HHP 1992a4), west of Keawewai,
above Kipuka Ahiu on Mauna Loa (HHP 1992a3, 1992a5), and near Hilo (HHP 1992a2). This fern is now known from eight populations
on Hawaii between 1,600 and 2,377 m (5,250 and 7,800 ft) elevation (HHP 1992a7, Shaw 1992). These populations are on
Federal, State, and private land. The populations are located at Keanakolu, Puu Huluhulu, Pohakuloa Training Area
(nine subpopulations), Kulani Correctional Facility, Keauhou, the Mauna Loa Strip in Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, Kapapala Forest Reserve, and the summit area of Hualalai (HHP 1992a1, 1992a7 to 1992a11, 1992a13; Shaw 1992;
Paul Higashino, The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, Daniel Palmer, naturalist, and Warren H. Wagner, Jr., University
of Michigan, pers. comms., 1992). The eight known populations total about 295 plants (Shaw 1992; Robert Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993; P. Higashino, D. Palmer, and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). This fern is found in 

Metrosideros

 (&Ograve;hi&agrave;) Dry Montane Forest, 

Dodonaea

 (&Agrave;&agrave;li&igrave;) Dry Montane Shrubland, 

Myoporum/Sophora 

(Naio/Mamane) Dry Montane Forest (Shaw 1992), and &ograve;hi&agrave;/

Acacia

 (koa) forest (HHP 1992a9). 

Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 grows almost exclusively in lava tubes, pits, and deep cracks, with at least a moderate soil or ash accumulation, associated
with mosses and liverworts. Infrequently, this fern has been found growing on the interface between younger &agrave;&agrave;
lava flows and much older pahoehoe lava or ash deposits (Shaw 1992). The primary threats to 

Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 are browsing by feral sheep (

Ovis aries

) and goats (

Capra hircus

) and competition with the alien plant 

Pennisetum setaceum

 (fountain grass). At least one population is threatened by military operations and/or fires resulting from these
operations (Loyal Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), pers. comm., 1993). Stochastic extinction
due to the relatively small number of existing individuals is also of concern. 



Ctenitis squamigera

 was first published as 

Nephrodium squamigerum 

by Hooker and Arnott in 1832. The species was subsequently placed in the genera 

Lastraea, Aspidium,

 and 

Dryopteris.

 In 1957 it was transferred to the genus 

Ctenitis,

 resulting in the currently accepted combination 

Ctenitis squamigera

 (Degener and Degener 1957). 



Ctenitis squamigera,

 a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), has a rhizome (horizontal stem) 5 to 10 millimeters (mm) (0.2 to
0.4 in) thick, creeping above the ground and densely covered with scales similar to those on the lower part of the leaf
stalk. The leaf stalks are 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 in) long and densely clothed with tan-colored scales up to 1.8 cm (0.7 in)
long and 1 mm (0.04 in) wide. The leafy part of the frond is deltoid to ovate-oblong, dark green, thin, and twice pinnate
to thrice pinnatifid (leaflet sections). The sori are tan-colored when mature and in a single row one-third of the
distance from the margin to the midrib of the ultimate segments (Degener and Degener 1957). 

Ctenitis squamigera

 can be readily distinguished from other Hawaiian species of 

Ctenitis

 by the dense covering of tan-colored scales on its fronds (Wagner and Wagner 1992).

Historically, 

Ctenitis squamigera 

was recorded from above Waimea on Kauai (HHP 1992b3); Kaluanui, southeast of Kahana Bay, Pauoa, Nuuanu, Niu, and Wailupe
in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1992b4 to 1992b5, 1992b9 to 1992b12); at Kaluaaha Valley on Molokai (HHP 1992b6);
in the mountains near Koele on Lanai (HHP 1992b7); in the Honokohau Drainage on West Maui (HHP 1992b1); and at ``Kalua''
on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992b13). The seven populations that have been observed within the last 50 years are in
the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, Lanai, and East and West Maui. The two Waianae Mountain populations are in the East Makaleha/Kaawa
area and at Schofield Barracks (HHP 1991, 1992b2; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). On Lanai, 

Ctenitis squamigera 

is known from the Waiapaa-Kapohaku area on the leeward side of the island, and Lopa Gulch and Waiopa Gulch on the windward
side (HHP 1991). The West Maui population is in Iao Valley (Joel Lau, HHP, pers. comm., 1992). The East Maui population
is at Manawainui Stream, 3.5 kilometers (km) (2.2 miles (mi)) north of Kaupo Village (HHP 1992b8). The seven populations
are on State, Federal, and private land and total approximately 80 plants (J. Lau and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992).
This species is found in the understory of forests at elevations of 380 to 915 m (1,250 to 3,000 ft) (HHP 1991, 1992b8),
in &Ograve;hi&agrave;/

Diospyros 

(Lama) Mesic Forest and diverse mesic forest (HHP 1991). Associated plant taxa include 

Myrsine 

(kolea), 

Psychotria 

(kopiko), and 

Xylosma 

(maua) (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The primary threats to 

Ctenitis squamigera 

are habitat degradation by feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

), goats, and axis deer (

Axis axis

); competition with alien plant taxa; and stochastic extinction due to the small number of existing populations and
individuals. 


Diplazium molokaiense 

was published by Winifred Robinson (1913) as a new name for the Hawaiian plants that had previously been referred to
as the extra-Hawaiian species, 

Asplenium arboreum 

Willd., by Hillebrand (1888). 



Diplazium molokaiense

, a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), has a short prostrate rhizome. The leaf stalks are 15 to 20 cm (6
to 8 in) long and green or straw-colored. The frond is thin-textured, ovate-oblong, 15 to 50 cm (6 to 20 in) long and 10
to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) wide, truncate at the base, and pinnate with a pinnatifid apex. The sori are 0.8 to 1.3 cm (0.3 to 0.5
in) long and lie alongside the side veins of the pinnae (Hillebrand 1888, Wagner and Wagner 1992). 

Diplazium molokaiense 

can be distinguished from other species of 

Diplazium 

in the Hawaiian Islands by a combination of characters, including venation pattern, the length and arrangement of
the sori, frond shape, and the degree of dissection of the frond (Wagner and Wagner 1992). 

Historically, 

Diplazium molokaiense 

was found at Kaholuamano on Kauai (HHP 1992c7); Makaleha on Oahu (HHP 1992c3); Kalae, Kaluaaha, Mapulehu, and the
Wailau Trail on Molokai (HHP 1992c5, 1992c11 to 1992c13); Mahana Valley and Kaiholena on Lanai (HHP 1992c8, 1992c9);
and Wailuku (Iao) Valley and Waikapu on West Maui (HHP 1992c1, 1992c4). However, within the last 50 years, it has been
recorded from only one location on Oahu and three on East Maui. The Oahu population is at Schofield Barracks in the Waianae
Mountains (HHP 1992c2). The three Maui populations are on the slopes of Haleakala: Two populations on the north slope
at Ainahou and Maliko Gulch (HHP 1992c6, 1992c10), and the third on the south slope at Waiopai Gulch (Robert Hobdy,
Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife, and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992). The currently known populations of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

are between 850 and 1,680 m (2,800 and 5,500 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992c6, 1992c10) in lowland to montane habitats,
including Montane Mesic &Ograve;hi&agrave;/Koa Forest (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). The four populations are
on private, State, and Federal land and total 23 individuals (R. Hobdy and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). The primary
threats to 

Diplazium molokaiense 

are habitat degradation by feral goats, cattle (

Bos taurus

), and pigs; competition with alien plant taxa; and stochastic extinction due to the extremely small number of populations
and individuals. 



Cheilanthes lidgatei 

was described in 1883 on the basis of a specimen collected on Oahu. Hillebrand (1888) erected the genus 

Schizostege 

for this anomalous species. In 1897, it was placed in the genus 

Pteris 

by H. Christ, resulting in the currently accepted combination 

Pteris lidgatei 

(Wagner 1949). 



Pteris lidgatei

, a member of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae), is a coarse herb, 0.5 to 1 m (1.6 to 3.3 ft) tall. It has a horizontal
rhizome 1.5 cm (0.6 in) thick and at least 10 cm (3.9 in) long when mature. The fronds, including the leaf stalks, are
60 to 95 cm (24 to 37 in) long and 20 to 45 cm (8 to 18 in) wide. The leafy portion of the frond is oblong-deltoid to broadly
ovate-deltoid, thick, brittle, and dark gray-green. The sori are apparently marginal in position, either fused
into long linear sori, or more typically separated into distinct shorter sori, with intermediate conditions being
common (Wagner 1949). 

Pteris lidgatei 

can be distinguished from other species of 

Pteris 

in the Hawaiian Islands by the texture of its fronds and the tendency of the sori along the leaf margins to be broken into
short segments instead of being fused into continuous marginal sori (Wagner and Wagner 1992).

Historically, 

Pteris lidgatei 

was found at Olokui on Molokai (HHP 1992d4) and Waihee on West Maui (HHP 1992d5). The species was also recorded historically
at three locations in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu: Waiahole, Lulumahu Stream, and Wailupe (HHP 1992d1, 1992d2, 1992d6).
Only three populations totaling 26 individuals, have been seen within the past 50 years. One population, containing
13 plants, is on State-owned land in the Kaluanui Stream drainage on the windward side of the central Koolau Mountains
at 530 to 590 m (1,750 to 1,930 ft) elevation (HHP 1992d3; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The Kaluanui population grows
on steep stream banks in wet &ograve;hi&agrave; forest with mosses and other ferns, including 

Cibotium chamissoi 

(hapu&ugrave; &igrave;&igrave;), 

Dicranopteris linearis 

(uluhe), 

Elaphoglossum crassifolium

, 

Sadleria squarrosa 

(&agrave;ma&ugrave;), and 

Sphenomeris chusana 

(pala&aacute;) (HHP 1992d3). One additional plant was discovered on Oahu along the South Kaukonahua Stream (HHP
1993). One population of 12 plants was also discovered along the back wall of Kauaula Valley on Maui (Steve Perlman,
National Tropical Botanical Garden, pers. comm., 1993). The primary threats to 

Pteris lidgatei 

are the alien plant 

Clidemia hirta 

(Koster's curse), habitat destruction by feral pigs, and stochastic extinction. 



Previous Federal Action 



Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States.
This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,


Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

, 

Diplazium molokaiense

, and 

Pteris lidgatei

 were considered to be endangered. 

Ctenitis squamigera 

was considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
taxa, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct. The list of 1,700 plant taxa
was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response
to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 

General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including these four
species, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants
on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these three
notices, 

Pteris lidgatei 

was treated as a category 1 candidate for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file
substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals.
In the 1980 and 1985 notices, 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare

, 

Ctenitis squamigera

, and 

Diplazium molokaiense 

were considered category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct. Because new information
indicated their current existence, 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

(as 

Asplenium fragile

) and 

Diplazium molokaiense 

were given category 1 status in the 1990 notice. In that notice, 

Ctenitis squamigera 

was still considered a category 1* species. However, because this species was rediscovered within the past 3 years,
it is included in this rule. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982
amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these taxa was warranted, but precluded
by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding
was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having
been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985,
1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposal to list the species constituted the final 1-year
finding for these four taxa. 

On June 24, 1993, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 34231) a proposal to list these four ferns from the Hawaiian Islands as endangered. This proposal was based primarily
on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program and observations by botanists and naturalists. With the publication
of this final rule, the Service determines these four ferns from the Hawaiian Islands to be endangered.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



In the June 24, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period
ended on August 23, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment
was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on July 16, 1993, ``The Maui News'' on July 21, 1993, and the ``Hawaii
Tribune Herald on July 19, 1993. One letter of comment was received offering additional information on the distribution
of one taxon. This information has been incorporated into this final rule. One phone call was received opposing the
listing and raising the following issue: 



Issue:

 The control of feral ungulates is unnecessary and done using inhumane methods. 



Response:

 Several studies verify that feral ungulates damage native plants and habitats. Feral goats and pigs have been implicated
in the damage of native vegetation ranging from lowland to subalpine areas (Mueller-Dombois and Spatz 1972; Spatz
and Mueller-Dombois 1973, 1975; Scowcroft and Sakai 1983). Goat browsing damage has been observed on individuals
of 

Asplenium fragile

 var. 

insulare

 (R. Shaw, 

in litt.,

 1993). Goats, sheep, axis deer, and/or pigs threaten all four taxa through habitat degradation. Recovery efforts
for these four endangered taxa should include the control of feral ungulates, but this control should be done in the
most humane way possible, consistent with the need to protect the habitat of these taxa. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species
may be determined to be an endangered species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The
threats facing these four taxa are summarized in Table 1.

These factors and their application to

Morton (no common name (NCN)), 

Ctenitis squamigera 

(Hook. & Arnott) Copel. (pauoa), 

Diplazium molokaiense 

W. J. Robinson (NCN), and 

Pteris lidgatei 

(Baker) Christ (NCN) are as follows: 
A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range. 

Native vegetation on all of the main Hawaiian Islands has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present
land management practices including ranching, deliberate animal and alien plant introductions, and agricultural
development (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner 

et al. 

1985). Military operations threaten at least one population of 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

(L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Habitat disturbance caused by human activities such as military construction
and road building could detrimentally impact 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

at Pohakuloa Training Area (Shaw 1992). The primary threats facing the four endangered taxa include ongoing and threatened
destruction and modification of habitat by feral animals and competition with alien plants. All four taxa are threatened
by feral animals. Pigs, goats, sheep and cattle were introduced either by the early Hawaiians or more recently by European
settlers for food and commercial ranching activities. Over the 200 years following their introduction, their numbers
increased and the adverse impacts of these ungulates on native vegetation have become increasingly apparent. 

First introduced to Maui in 1793 (Stone and Loope 1987), goats became established on other Hawaiian islands by the
1820s (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988). Far from controlling their numbers, the era of trade in goatskins (mid-1800s)
saw the feral goat population increase into the millions (Culliney 1988). As a result of their agility, they were able
to reach more remote areas than other ungulates (Culliney 1988). Feral goats now occupy a wide variety of habitats,
from dry lowland forests to alpine grasslands, where they consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings,
accelerate erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985, Stone and Loope
1987). Three of the endangered fern taxa are threatened by habitat degradation caused by goats. On Oahu, goats are
contributing to the decline of a population of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

at East Makaleha/Kaawa in the Mokuleia region of the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1991). On Maui, large populations of feral
goats persist on the south slope of Haleakala, outside of Haleakala National Park, where they threaten the population
of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

at Waiopai (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). Goats have reduced the species' habitat there to small remnants. On the island
of Hawaii, feral goats are also present in large numbers within Pohakuloa Training Area in the saddle between Mauna
Loa and Mauna Kea, where they threaten 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

through habitat degradation as well as direct browsing on the plants (R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Feral sheep have become firmly established on the island of Hawaii (Tomich 1986) since their introduction almost
200 years ago (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Like feral goats, sheep roam the upper elevation dry forests of Mauna Kea (above
1,000 m (3,300 ft)), including Pohakuloa Training Area, causing damage similar to that of goats (Stone 1985). The
presence of sheep at Pohakuloa Training Area is contributing to the degradation of the habitat of 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare. 
Large-scale cattle ranching in the Hawaiian Islands began in the middle of the 19th century on the islands of Kauai,
Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. Ranches, tens of thousands of acres in size, developed on East Maui and Hawaii (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990), where most of the State's large ranches still exist. Degradation of native forests used for ranching
activities became evident soon after full-scale ranching began. The negative impact of cattle on Hawaii's ecosystems
is similar to that described for goats and sheep (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Cattle ranching is the primary
economic activity on the west and southwest slopes of East Maui, where a population of Diplazium molokaiense 

exists at Waiopai (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). 
Habitat degradation caused by axis deer (

Axis axis

) is now considered to be a major threat to the forests of Lanai (Culliney 1988). Deer browse on native vegetation, destroying
or damaging the habitat. Their trampling removes ground cover, compacts the soil, promotes erosion, and opens areas,
allowing alien plants to invade (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Scott 

et al. 

1986, Tomich 1986). Extensive red erosional scars caused by decades of deer activity are evident on Lanai. Axis deer
are presently actively managed for recreational hunting by the State Department of Land and Natural Resources. All
three of the Lanai populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera

 are negatively affected to some extent by axis deer (HHP 1991). 
Feral pigs have invaded primarily wet and mesic forests and grasslands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii.
Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor, and encourage the expansion of alien
plants in the newly tilled soil (Stone 1985). Pigs also disseminate alien plant seeds through their feces and on their
bodies, accelerating the spread of alien plants through native forest (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). On Oahu,
populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera

, 

Diplazium molokaiense

, and 

Pteris lidgatei 

have already sustained loss of individual plants and/or habitat as a result of feral pig activities. The following
Oahu populations are threatened by pigs: 

Ctenitis squamigera 

at Schofield Barracks and nearby East Makaleha-Kaawa; 

Diplazium molokaiense 

at Schofield Barracks (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992); and, in Kaluanui Valley, the only extant population of


Pteris lidgatei 

(HHP 1992d3; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, feral pigs threaten the populations of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

at both Ainahou and Waiopai (R. Hobdy and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992).

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

Although not currently known to be a factor, unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes or
excessive visits by individuals interested in seeing rare plants could seriously impact three of these taxa. 

Ctenitis squamigera

, 

Diplazium molokaiense

, and 

Pteris lidgatei 

each number fewer than 100 individuals and fewer than 10 populations, making them especially vulnerable to human
disturbance. Such disturbance could promote erosion and greater ingression of alien plant taxa. 
C. 

Disease or predation

. No evidence of disease has been reported for the four endangered fern taxa. Predation by feral goats and/or sheep
has been reported for 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

at Pohakuloa Training Area (Shaw 1992, R. Shaw, 

in litt

., 1993). Because no colonies have been completely decimated by the animals, they apparently do not seek out this fern.
However, further predation may occur if their preferred forage is not available. Predation by feral goats is a potential
threat to the other two sizable known populations of this fern at Keauhou and Kulani (Linda Cuddihy, Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park, pers. comm., 1992). 
D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms

. Three of the endangered fern taxa have populations located on privately owned land. All four also occur on State and
Federal lands. The known populations of these species located on Federal lands are inadequate to ensure their long-term
survival. There are no State laws or existing regulatory mechanisms at the present time to protect or prevent further
decline of these plants on State or private land. However, Federal listing automatically invokes listing under Hawaii
State law. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D-4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife,
or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act [of 1973]
shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter.'' This State law prohibits cutting,
collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant on State or private land,
or attempting to engage in any such conduct. However, the regulations are difficult to enforce because of limited
personnel. Further, the State law encourages conservation by State government agencies. The State may enter into
agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement,
or protection of endangered species (HRS, Sect. 195D-5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available
under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). Listing of these four plant taxa therefore triggers,
reinforces and supplements the protection available under State law. The Act also provides additional protection
to these four species because it is a violation of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any
such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course
of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued existence. 

The small number of populations and of individual plants of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from
stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental
disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. For example,
only 4 populations of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

are known, totaling 23 individuals. 

Pteris lidgatei 

is known from 3 populations totaling 26 individuals, 

Ctenitis squamigera 

from 7 populations, and 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

from 8 populations. Three of the endangered taxa are estimated to number no more than 100 known individuals and the
fourth (

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare

) numbers fewer than 300 known individuals. 
All four endangered fern taxa are threatened by competition with one or more alien plant taxa. Koster's curse, a noxious
shrub first reported on Oahu in 1941, had spread through much of the Koolau Mountains by the early 1960s, and spread
to the Waianae Mountains by 1970 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This shrub replaces native plants of the forest understory
and poses a serious threat to the population of 

Pteris lidgatei 

located in Kaluanui Valley on the windward side of the Koolau Mountains (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). It also poses a
threat to populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

and 

Diplazium molokaiense 

in the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).

Noxious alien plants such as 

Schinus terebinthifolius 

(Christmasberry) have invaded the dry to mesic lowland regions of the Hawaiian Islands. Introduced to Hawaii prior
to 1911, Christmasberry forms dense thickets that shade out and displace other plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Both
of the Oahu populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera, 

the West Maui population, and one of the Lanai populations are negatively affected by this invasive plant, as is the
population of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

at Schofield Barracks (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Psidium cattleianum 

(strawberry guava), a shrub or small tree, has become naturalized on all of the main Hawaiian islands except Niihau
and Kahoolawe. Like Christmasberry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands that exclude other plant
taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This alien plant grows primarily in mesic and wet habitats and provides food for several
alien animal taxa, including feral pigs and game birds, that disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith
1985, Wagner 

et al. 

1985). Strawberry guava is considered one of the greatest alien plant threats to Hawaii's wet forests and is known
to pose a direct threat to the populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

and 

Diplazium molokaiense 

in the Waianae Mountains on Oahu (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). It also threatens the populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

on Lanai and East Maui (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 
Fountain grass is a fire-adapted bunch grass that has spread rapidly over bare lava flows and open areas on the island
of Hawaii since its introduction in the early 1900s. Fountain grass is particularly detrimental to Hawaii's dry forests
because it is able to invade areas once dominated by native plants, where it interferes with plant regeneration, carries
fires, and increases the likelihood of fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985). Fountain grass threatens the native
vegetation at PTA, competing with 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

(J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 


Toona ciliata 

(Australian red cedar) is a fast-growing tree that has been extensively planted and has become naturalized in mesic
to wet forests (Wagner 

et al. 

1990). This tree threatens populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

and 

Diplazium molokaiense 

in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Those same populations are threatened by 

Syzygium cumini 

(Java plum), a large evergreen tree that forms a dense cover, excluding other taxa. Java plum is an aggressive invader
of undisturbed lowland mesic and dry forests (Smith 1985). 

Myrica faya

 (firetree) has attracted a great deal of attention and concern for its recent explosive increase on several Hawaiian
islands. It is capable of forming a dense, nearly monospecific stand (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Because of its ability
to fix nitrogen, it outcompetes native taxa and enriches the soil so that other alien plants can invade (Wagner 

et al. 

1990). The Lanai populations of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

are threatened by the invasion of firetree (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Although not yet widespread in the
Hawaiian Islands, 

Cinnamomum burmanii 

(Padang cassia) could become a dominant component of Hawaiian mesic forests (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). A dense and
enlarging stand of it threatens a population of 

Ctenitis squamigera 

on Lanai (HHP 1991). 
Fire constitutes a potential threat to three of the endangered fern taxa growing in dry to mesic grassland, shrubland,
and forests on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii. On Oahu, fire is a potential threat to 

Ctenitis squamigera 

and the population of 

Diplazium molokaiense 

on the Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. These populations are located near an area currently utilized as
a military firing range. Fires originating on the firing range have the potential of spreading into the native forest
habitat of the two fern taxa (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Fire is also a potential threat to the population of 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

at Pohakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaii (Shaw 1992), where military exercises utilizing live ammunition
are conducted. The presence of fountain grass at Pohakuloa Training Area increases the potential of fire. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining this final rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking
will list four taxa_

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare, Ctenitis squamigera, Diplazium molokaiense, 

and 

Pteri lidgatei

_as endangered. All 4 endangered taxa are known from fewer than 10 populations and 3 of the taxa number no more than 100
individuals. The four taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and/or predation by
feral goats, sheep, cattle, deer, and pigs; and competition from alien plants. Small population size and limited
distribution make these taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction from stochastic events. Because these four
taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of
endangered as defined in the Act. 
Critical habitat is not being proposed for the four taxa included in this rule for reasons discussed in the ``Critical
Habitat'' section below. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these taxa. All of the taxa have extremely low total populations
and face anthropogenic threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

, as required in designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism
and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified
of the general location of these taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will be addressed through the recovery
process and through the section 7 consultation process. 
Two Federal departments conduct activities within the currently known habitat of the endangered plants_the National
Park Service of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense. One taxon is found in Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park, where Federal law protects all plants from damage or removal. Three taxa are located on land owned or
leased by the Department of Defense or on nearby State lands. Three of the taxa are found on Schofield Barracks Military
Reservation. Although military and ordnance training takes place on this federally owned property, the impact areas
and buffer zones for these activities are outside the area where the taxa occur. One taxon is known from Pohakuloa Training
Area on the Island of Hawaii. The Army is aware of the presence and location of this taxon, and any Federal activities
that may affect the continued existence of these plants will be addressed through the section 7 consultation process.
Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time, because
such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and it
would not provide overriding benefits.

Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Listing
can encourage and result in conservation actions by Federal, State, private organizations, and individuals. The
Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery
plans be developed for listed species. The requirements for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain
activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation
with the Service. 
A population of 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

is located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Laws relating to national parks prohibit damage or removal of any plants
growing in the parks. Another population of 

Asplenium fragile 

var. 

insulare 

is located within the Pohakuloa Training Area. The Army is aware of the location of this taxon, and any Federal activities
that may affect the continued existence of these plants will be addressed through the section 7 consultation process.


Ctenitis squamigera, Diplazium molokaiense, 

and 

Pteris lidgatei 

are found on Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. These plants are not located inside impact or buffer zones
for ordnance training. There are no other known Federal activities that occur within the present known habitat of
these four plant taxa. 
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered species set forth a
series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the four
fern taxa listed as endangered, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would
apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
to import or export any endangered plant species; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the
course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and
reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such
species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other
area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass
law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and
17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered
plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few permits would ever be sought or issued because
the taxa are not common in cultivation or in the wild. 
Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E.
11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063; FAX 503/231-6243). 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

action: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). Recovery recommendations in the draft plan would likely affect
six Southern California counties; Ventura, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Kern and Tulare. The Service
solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort,
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery
levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comment into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

As a result of illegal shooting, poisoning, collisions with man-made structures and the loss of habitat, the California
condor was extirpated from the wild in 1987. The last wild condor was captured and brought into a captive breeding program
in an attempt to save the species from extinction. The California Condor Recovery Plan outlines recovery actions
to re-establish the California condor in the wild. The recovery actions will be concentrated in the following six
Southern California counties; Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, Kern, and Tulare.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.






Authority: 

The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531).

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component
in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary
to prevent exceeding the allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the offshore component in the
BS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


The allowance of pollock TAC for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS was established
by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and a subsequent reserve apportionment
(59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 799,662 metric tons (mt).

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the BS soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional
Director established a directed fishing allowance of 789,662 mt after determining that 10,000 mt will be taken as
incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing
for pollock by operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  675.20(h).


Classification


This action is taken under  675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this final rule, RSPA is correcting editorial errors, making minor regulatory changes and, in response to requests
for clarification, improving the clarity of certain provisions to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR). In
addition, RSPA is revising legal citations in the HMR based on the codification of the hazardous materials transportation
laws. The intended effect of this rule is to enhance accuracy and reduce misunderstandings of the HMR. The amendments
contained in this rule are minor editorial changes and do not impose new requirements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


RSPA annually reviews the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to detect errors which may be causing confusion
to readers. Inaccuracies corrected in this final rule include typographical errors, incorrect references to other
rules and regulations in the CFR, inconsistent use of terminology, and misstatements of certain regulatory requirements.
In response to inquiries RSPA received concerning the clarity of particular requirements specified in the HMR, certain
other changes are made to reduce uncertainties. In addition, RSPA is revising all legal citations contained in the
HMR to reflect the codification of transportation laws relating to hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127.

Since these amendments do not impose new requirements, notice and public procedure are unnecessary. For the same
reason, there is good cause to make these amendments effective without the customary 30-day delay following publication.
This will allow the changes to appear in the next revision of 49 CFR. 
The following is a section-by-section summary of the amendments made under this final rule. It does not discuss editorial
corrections (e.g., typographical, capitalization, and punctuation errors) or changes to the legal citations.



Part 106 




Section 106.3.

 Paragraph (b) is revised to reflect the correct title of the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety, and a new
paragraph (c) is added which delegates authority to the Associate Administrator for Research, Technology and Analysis.



Appendix A to Part 106.

 Appendix A to part 106 is removed because it duplicates the provisions in  106.3. 


Part 107 




Section 107.329.

 In paragraphs (a) and (b), references to ``subchapter B of this chapter'' are revised to read ``this subchapter''.



Section 107.403.

 In paragraph (c), references to ``Director'' are revised to reflect the correct title of the Associate Administrator
for Hazardous Materials Safety. 


Section 107.503.

 Paragraph (c) is revised to reflect the correct reference to the ASME Certificate of Authorization. 


Part 171 




Section 171.2.

 The term ``rail freight car'' is replaced with ``rail car''. 


Section 171.7.

 The entry for Compressed Gas Association is revised to reflect the correct address. 


Section 171.8.

 In the definition of ``NPT'', the wording ``in compliance with the'' is revised to read ``conforming to'' for consistency.



Section 171.11.

 In paragraph (d)(6)(i), the wording `` 171.203(d)(1)(iii)'' is revised to reflect the correct section reference.



Section 171.12.

 In paragraph (d)(1), the wording `` 171.203(d)(1)(iii)'' is revised to reflect the correct section reference.



Part 172 




Section 172.101.

 All references to ``the appendix'' in paragraph (c)(8) are revised to read ``Appendix A''. In paragraph (g), the reference
to ``subpart D'' is revised to read ``subpart E''. In addition, paragraph (d)(4) is amended to refer to `` 173.150
(e) or (f)'' since both provisions set forth criteria for reclassing a material as a combustible liquid. 


The Hazardous Materials Table (the Table).

 In the Table, the entry 

``Ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide mixtures,

 see Carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide mixtures, etc.'' is removed because ``Carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide mixtures''
is not listed as a proper shipping name. 


Section 172.102.

 Special Provision 14 is amended to clarify the definition of motor fuel antiknock mixtures. Special Provision 42
is removed because the same provision appears in  173.218. In Special Provision B33, the phrase ``is subject
to the following requirements.'' is revised to read ``must conform to Table 1 as follows.'' In paragraph (c)(7)(ii),
the statement ``These provisions apply only to transportation in IM portable tanks:'' is removed because it duplicates
the introductory text of paragraph (c)(7). Special Provision T31 is amended by correcting the abbreviation ``kpa''
to ``kPa''. Additionally, in Special Provision T31, the temperature ``65 
 C'' is revised to read ``65.6 
 C''. 


Section 172.203.

 Paragraph (h)(2)(i) is amended by replacing the word ``to'' with the word ``of'' preceding the words ``this subchapter''.

Background


The Air Tour Industry


Since 1980, the air tour industry in the State of Hawaii has grown rapidly, particularly on the islands of Oahu, Kauai,
Maui, and Hawaii. The growth of the tourist industry, the beauty of the islands, and the inaccessibility of some areas
on the islands has generated tremendous growth in the number of air tour flights. In 1982, there were approximately
63,000 helicopter and 11,000 airplane air tour flights. By 1991, these numbers had increased to approximately 101,000
for helicopters and 18,000 for airplanes. After a slight decline due to Hurricane Iniki in 1992, air tour flights in
1994 are projected to reach the 1991 levels. In Hawaii, the air tour industry carries about 400,000 passengers annually.
Thirty-eight operators are conducting air tours within the State of Hawaii, using approximately 97 helicopters
and 16 fixed-wing aircraft. During the 9-year period between 1982 and 1991, there were eight fatal accidents with
24 fatalities. The accident data shows an escalation of fatal accidents during the 3-year period between 1991 and
1994. During this time, there were five fatal accidents with 24 fatalities. (See table and figure)


Use of Helicopters in Air Tours


Helicopters are uniquely suited for air tours in Hawaii because they can operate at slow speeds and hover over scenic
areas. Helicopter air tours are often conducted close to the ground, near scenic attractions so passengers can see
and experience the thrill of being close to geological and terrain features, such as lava flows and waterfalls.
Some air tour operators advertise dramatic overwater flights to view whales, shorelines, cliffs, and waterfalls;
entry into one-way canyons; flying close to hot molten lava; and hovering over the shoreline where molten lava flows
into the ocean. Some advertising brochures, for example, describe air tours as ``excitement to the boiling point,''
and invite tourists to ``fly into the heart and heat of an active volcano'' and ``close enough to waterfalls to feel
the cooling mist.'' One fixed-wing air tour operator formerly advertised that ``[w]e fly you lower and slower than
any twin engine plane can . . . lower and slower than many helicopters do . . .''
While passengers are often attracted to the thrill associated with low-flying air tours, they are generally not aware
of the risks involved. Risks associated with low flying air tour operations include: unpredictable winds that create
less stable flying conditions; fewer options to escape unforeseen weather; unmarked or unknown obstructions; less
time to select suitable emergency landing areas; increases in pilot workload because of quick stops, rapid turns,
and watching for obstructions; inability to be detected by air traffic control radar; inability to conduct two-way
radio communication; increased likelihood of ingesting foreign debris, including salt water spray, into the engine;
less overall reaction time; and congestion of low flying traffic at scenic locations. Further, many air tours are
conducted over scenic areas along rugged coasts, where, in the event of an engine failure, the pilot must ditch in the
ocean. A helicopter without flotation devices, unlike most light airplanes, may sink within moments.


History and Escalation of Accidents


The growth of the air tour sightseeing industry in Hawaii has been associated with an escalation of accidents. The
proximate causes of the accidents range from engine power loss to encounters with adverse weather. Contributing
factors to the causes and seriousness of accidents are: operation beyond the demonstrated performance envelope
of the aircraft, inadequate preflight planning for weather and routes, lack of survival equipment, and flying at
low altitudes (which does not allow time for recovery or forced landing preparation in the event of a power failure).
The following table is a synopsis of selected air tour accidents involving aircraft damage, minor or serious injuries,
or fatalities that occurred between September 1982 and September 1994.

The table shows a total of 24 air tour fatalities between 1982 and 1991 (9 years). Even though there was a decline in the
number of air tour flights in 1992, the accident data show an escalation of fatal accidents between 1991 and 1994. From
July 1991 through July 1994 (3 years), there were 20 air tour accidents involving 24 fatalities. (See figure.) Since
January 1993, three helicopter accidents have involved landings in the ocean with two of those accidents resulting
in seven fatalities. The most recent fatal accident occurred on July 14, 1994. The most recent non-fatal accident
occurred on September 3, 1994. (See table.)

National Transportation Safety Board Recommendations



Based on its investigation of the April 22, 1992, accident in Haleakala National Park, the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that the FAA ``[c]reate a specific classification for, and operating rules governing,
commercial air tour operators based on the complexity of flight operations, aircraft flown, flight frequency, number
of passengers carried, air traffic densities in the area of operation, and other relevant factors'' (A-93-8).
In addition, the NTSB recommended that the FAA ``[i]dentify airspace which warrants special protection due to air
tour operations,'' and ``[c]reate special operating rules for such airspace to reduce the potential for midair collisions
and other accidents commensurate with meteorological and terrain considerations.'' (A-93-10) In response
to the NTSB's recommendations, the FAA has informed the NTSB that it is considering a special rule for air tour operators
in Hawaii.

Based on the NTSB recommendations, accident investigations, and discussions with the NTSB, the FAA has identified
the following as needing to be addressed:

(1) Air tour operators fly too close and too low to various attractions and land features.

(2) There is no clear definition of ``suitable landing site'' for helicopters.

(3) Sightseeing helicopters are operating in the avoid area of the height-speed envelope (deadman's curve) where
successful autorotations are not possible.

(4) Helicopters operating along the shorelines of the Hawaiian Islands should be equipped with appropriate flotation
equipment.

(5) Passengers should be briefed before flights on the use of flotation gear.



Actions Other Than Rulemaking to Address the Problems



The FAA, the State of Hawaii, and the air tour industry have been attempting to correct safety problems that affect
air tour operations.

In 1986, the FAA conducted a study of helicopter sightseeing operations in Hawaii. The study team was composed of representatives
from the FAA, the State of Hawaii, and industry. Based on the study, recommendations were made to the State and to operators
in Hawaii to improve safety and community relations. Recommendations included the following:

(1) The FAA should study the possibility of imposing limitations, through operations specifications, that would
require the helicopter to be operated at a combination of height and forward speed (including hover) that would permit
a safe landing in event of engine power loss, in accordance with the height-speed envelope for that helicopter under
current weight and aircraft altitude. These limitations would also prevent the helicopter from being flown over
areas in which a safe forced landing could not be made.

(2) The FAA should advise helicopter operators who conduct passenger-carrying operations under part 91 or part 135
that a flight (1) over an area in which a successful forced landing could not be made, or (2) at an airspeed and altitude
combination that places the aircraft beyond its performance capability to successfully autorotate, would be considered
a reckless operation under  91.13 (formerly  91.9).

The study team was also concerned about the lack of helicopter flotation equipment on some aircraft, particularly
for operations along the coastlines of the islands, where cliffs and rocks make a successful autorotation to shore
virtually impossible. The team believes that the shoreline must offer a reasonable chance to land safely in the event
of engine failure, and that, if no such area exists, appropriate helicopter flotation equipment should be required.

Also, in 1986, the FAA conducted a joint study with the State of Hawaii on helicopter heliport and airport access. A
result of that study was the Helicopter Operating Plan for Hawaii. Based on portions of that plan, the Hawaiian Helicopters
Operators Association (HHOA) developed its ``Fly Neighborly'' program. The HHOA plan calls for voluntary compliance
with a standoff distance of 1,500 feet and a minimum altitude of 1,500 feet over communities. In addition, the plan
calls for a 3,000-foot standoff distance in areas of Volcanoes National Park. The HHOA program includes part 91 operators
as well as part 135 certificated operators. This is a voluntary program without FAA oversight.

On January 17, 1992, the FAA issued Handbook Bulletin No. 92-01, Air Tour/Sightseeing Operations. The bulletin
advises principal operations inspectors to recommend to operators that they include procedures in their operations
manuals for conducting air tour/sightseeing operations. The bulletin also advises the inclusion of charts of air
tour areas, procedures for obtaining current weather, provisions for pilot training, and other information specific
to air tour operations.

In January 1994, the FAA held four public meetings in Hawaii to investigate complaints regarding flight safety, aircraft
noise, and possible intrusive flights of helicopters. While the vast majority of the commenters addressed the noise
issue, some commenters did raise safety issues. Some of the public meeting comments and subsequent comments submitted
to the FAA highlight a number of personal experiences of individuals who witnessed helicopters flying dangerously
low over scenic areas and above people and property on the ground. In some instances, witnesses claimed that the aircraft
flew lower than the people who were walking on high elevation trails.

The Honolulu Flight Standards District Office, during the past 3 years, has conducted an extensive inspection and
surveillance program of the air tour industry. On July 15, 1994, in response to a number of recent accidents, the FAA
initiated a comprehensive review of operations and maintenance practices of the Hawaiian air tour operators. In
addition, the FAA requested that all air tour operators in the State of Hawaii immediately conduct a ``stand down''
safety review of their operational and maintenance practices.



Need for Emergency Rulemaking



Despite the voluntary measures, the cooperation of the Hawaii air tour operators, and the FAA's inspections, the
accident data show that additional measures are necessary to ensure safe air tour operations in Hawaii. The current
regulatory scheme is not comprehensive enough to ensure the safety of all air tour operations in Hawaii.

Section 91.119 prescribes minimum altitudes for airplanes and helicopters that provide for the protection of persons
and property on the surface. Generally, a pilot may not operate below an altitude allowing, if power failure occurs,
an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface. Helicopters may be operated at lower
altitudes than airplanes if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface and the
pilot can conduct a safe emergency landing in the event of power failure.

Under ideal conditions, a helicopter, unlike an airplane, can land at or near zero forward speed, provided the landing
area is relatively level and free of obstructions. Factors that make an emergency landing site unsuitable include
obstacles, rugged terrain, congested areas and water. Obstacles range from natural terrain features and trees to
buildings and utility towers with wires strung between them.

A major factor affecting safety of flight in any single engine aircraft at low altitude is the limited choice of suitable
emergency landing areas. Hawaii's unique topography_active volcanoes spewing hot molten lava, sharp cliffs, cascading
waterfalls, rugged coastlines, mist-shrouded mountains, dense tropical rainforests and deep, closed canyons_often
complicates access to suitable emergency landing areas. The air tour accidents in Hawaii indicate that helicopter
pilots have had insufficient time to locate suitable landing areas after engine power loss or other problems leading
to accidents.

Based on the recent escalation of accidents caused by unsafe operating practices, and the fact that voluntary measures
are insufficient, the FAA is implementing this emergency final rule as Special Federal Regulation (SFAR) No. 71.



The Special Federal Aviation Regulation



The FAA is promulgating these requirements in an SFAR, rather than a general rule, to address the unique problems associated
with the Hawaiian air tour operating environment.

This emergency regulatory action establishes additional operating procedures, including minimum safe altitudes
(and associated increases in visual flight rules (VFR) weather minimums), minimum equipment requirements, and
operational limitations for air tour aircraft in the State of Hawaii.



Applicability and Definitions



This SFAR applies to parts 91 and 135 air tour operators in the State of Hawaii (section 1). In section 2, ``air tour''
is defined as any VFR sightseeing flight conducted in an airplane or helicopter for compensation or hire. ``Air tour
operator'' is defined as any person who conducts an air tour.



Flotation Devices



The SFAR requires that any single-engine air tour helicopter flown beyond the shore of any island must be amphibious
or equipped with emergency floats and approved flotation gear easily accessible for each occupant, or that each person
on board the helicopter wear approved flotation gear. An amphibious helicopter or one equipped with floats will allow
a safe emergency ditching. This requirement is specific to helicopters because helicopters, unlike airplanes,
may sink rapidly after forced landings on water.

These requirements should reduce the risk of drowning, such as the deaths that occurred on January 25, 1993, when a
helicopter, operating under part 91, crashed in deep water while on a sightseeing flight to view molten lava flowing
into the ocean off the coast of Volcanoes National Park. Before the accident, the pilot had been hovering near the shoreline
between 100 and 150 feet above sea level. When the pilot attempted to resume forward flight, he experienced a total
left pedal failure. The pilot lost control and the helicopter landed in the ocean and sank. The helicopter was not equipped
with flotation devices, and the pilot and four passengers were not wearing lifevests. Only the pilot survived. The
NTSB found that a factor which contributed to the passengers' fatal injuries was the operator's failure to provide
lifevests to the passengers.

In a July 14, 1994, accident, an air tour helicopter with seven people on board made a forced landing in the Pacific Ocean
after losing power off Kauai's Na Pali Coast. Three passengers swam to shore and another was rescued from the water.
The pilot and two other passengers drowned. The helicopter was not equipped with flotation devices, and the passengers
did not have sufficient time to don the lifevests on board the helicopter.

Later, on the same day, a different air tour helicopter made a forced landing after losing power off the north coast
of Molokai. All persons aboard the helicopter swam to shore and were rescued the next day. The helicopter was equipped
with flotation devices, and the pilot and passengers had sufficient time to don the lifevests.

Flotation equipment on a helicopter should allow the helicopter to remain afloat long enough for the persons to egress
safely; the individual flotation gear should allow the survivors an opportunity to swim to shore or to be picked up
by rescue personnel. Flotation equipment/lifevests helped to ensure the survival of the passengers in the second
accident on July 14.

The FAA is considering changing the rule to require that all single-engine helicopters conducting air tour operations
beyond the shore of any island be amphibious or fitted with flotation devices. Therefore, the FAA is requesting comments
on this possibility. At the close of the comment period, the FAA will analyze the comments received and, based on its
analysis, determine if further rulemaking is necessary.

Helicopter Performance Plan



Section 4 requires that, before departure, the air tour operator must complete a performance plan for the helicopter
flight. The pilot in command (PIC) is required to comply with the performance plan. The plan must be based on information
in the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM), considering the maximum density altitude to which the operation is planned
and must address such elements as maximum gross weight and center of gravity, maximum gross weight for hovering in
or out of ground effect, and maximum combination of weight, altitude, and temperature for which height-velocity
information in the RFM is valid. This requirement is necessary in light of accidents attributable to the failure of
the pilot to stay outside the avoid area of the helicopter height-velocity envelope. The flight is not limited to the
out-of-ground effect (OGE) ceiling, and the helicopter may be operated at a higher altitude provided no hovering
is planned.

This requirement should enhance flight safety in light of certain accidents, including that which took place on May
20, 1989. On that date, an Aerospatiale AS350D was on a local sightseeing flight to view Waialae Falls with six passengers
on board. After hovering at a low altitude near the falls, the pilot began a pedal turn and forward movement for the initial
climb away from the falls. The main rotor revolutions per minute (rpm) decayed, and the pilot turned back toward the
upper falls, where he thought he could land. However, the helicopter settled into a ravine, damaging the helicopter
and injuring the pilot and passengers. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's
failure to maintain rotor rpm, while turning and taking off from a hover with a relatively heavy gross weight. Additional
factors related to the accident were the high density altitude and rough/uneven (rocky) terrain in the emergency
landing area.



Helicopter Operating Limitations



Section 5 requires that the PIC shall operate the helicopter at a combination of height and forward speed (including
hover) that would permit a safe landing in the event of engine power loss, in accordance with the height-velocity envelope
for that helicopter under current weight and aircraft altitude. This requirement is necessary to prevent pilots
from hovering for periods of time beyond the performance capability of the helicopter and outside what the height-velocity
diagram permits for safe operation.

This requirement prohibits aircraft from being operated in dangerous flight regimes, such as the January 25, 1993,
accident discussed previously (when the pilot was hovering at a low altitude over a lava flow). It also is intended
to prevent the type of accidents that occurred on March 25, 1994, and April 18, 1994. On March 25, 1994, the pilot of a
Hughes 369D helicopter operated under part 135 lost control and collided with mountainous terrain by the Puu'oo Vent
in Hawaii National Park. The helicopter had become enveloped in a steam cloud at a 40-foot hover just before the pilot
lost control. The helicopter was destroyed; the pilot and passengers sustained minor injuries. On April 18, 1994,
a Hughes 369D helicopter lost power during an OGE hover and collided with rocky terrain below Waimea Falls, Waimea,
Kauai. The helicopter was on a sightseeing flight operated under part 135. The pilot and three passengers were seriously
injured. One passenger was fatally injured.

The requirement increases the possibility of safe landing in the event of engine failure. A safe landing may not be
possible if the helicopter is within the avoid area of the height-velocity envelope when the engine failure occurs.



Minimum Flight Altitudes

Section 6 requires that, unless operating in compliance with an air traffic control clearance, or as otherwise authorized
by the Administrator, air tour operations may not be conducted below an altitude of 1,500 feet above the surface; and
closer than 1,500 feet from any person or property; or below any altitude provided by Federal statute or regulation.
As noted earlier, Hawaii's unique topography often complicates access to suitable emergency landing areas. The
air tour accidents in Hawaii have been characterized by insufficient time for pilots to locate suitable landing areas
after engine power loss or other problems leading to accidents. The requirement to maintain an altitude of 1,500 feet
above the surface is necessary for safety because it allows the pilot sufficient time to react in an emergency, to notify
and instruct passengers, and to prepare for a forced landing. An aircraft operating at least 1,500 feet above the surface
allows the pilot a greater opportunity to select a suitable landing site than would be the case at lower altitudes.
The FAA notes that these minimum distances are consistent with HHOA's Fly Neighborly program.
The accident data also show low-flying aircraft flying VFR into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). An
additional benefit from the 1,500-foot minimum altitude will be the increased basic VFR weather minimums for these
air tour operations. This provision is necessary in light of the numerous accidents that have occurred when the aircraft
flew into terrain because of low visibility or because the pilot was flying too low. The accident data show that this
is a problem for both airplanes and helicopters. For instance, on April 24, 1987, an air tour flight operated under
part 91 collided with terrain in the Waimae Canyon. Marginal visual meteorological conditions were reported in the
vicinity of the accident site. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. In the January 25, 1993, accident,
in which the helicopter crashed in deep water after hovering between 100 and 150 feet above sea level, the NTSB noted
that a contributing factor to the accident was the pilot's choice of a hover altitude/position inadequate to reach
a shoreline in the event of an emergency.
On June 11, 1989, a Beechcraft BE-H18, operating under part 135 on a sightseeing flight, crashed near a waterfall
in the Waipio Valley of the Kohala Mountains on the island of Hawaii. After filing a VFR flight plan, the pilot had departed
Hilo International Airport for Maui. The pilot entered a closed canyon and ultimately impacted the canyon wall 600
to 900 feet below the rim. The pilot and 10 passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed by impact
forces and postcrash fire. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's improper decision
to maneuver with insufficient altitude in a canyon area.
On April 22, 1992, a Beechcraft E-18S operating on a VFR air tour flight collided with mountainous terrain in
Haleakala National Park in an area where fog had reduced visibility around the mountain top. The FAA had provided a
full weather briefing to the pilot, including an advisory that VFR flight was not recommended over the interior sections
of all islands, and a forecast indicating isolated areas of 3 miles visibility due to haze and moderate rainshowers.
The aircraft was destroyed, and the pilot and eight passengers were killed. Weather reports and witness statements
indicate that IMC existed in the area at the time of the accident. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of this
accident was the pilot's decision to continue visual flight into IMC that obscured rising mountainous terrain and
his failure to use properly available navigational information to remain clear of the island.
On September 16, 1992, an Aerospatiale AS-350B departed on a sightseeing flight even though adverse weather
conditions including thunderstorms, rainshowers, and poor visibility were reported. A witness reported rainshowers
and mountain obscuration about the time of the accident. He stated that he saw a helicopter flying in and out of clouds
and stated that he could not understand why a helicopter would be flying so close to the mountains given the adverse
weather conditions. The NTSB determined that a probable cause of the accident, which involved seven fatalities,
was the pilot's inflight decision to continue VFR flight into adverse weather conditions. A factor in the accident
was the pilot's inability to see and avoid the mountainous terrain due to the thunderstorms.

Section 7 contains the requirement that passengers be briefed (in addition to   91.102 and 135.117) before
takeoff for an air tour flight with a flight segment beyond the ocean shore of any island. The briefing shall include
information on water ditching procedures, use of personal flotation gear, and emergency egress from the aircraft.
The PIC must orally brief passengers, distribute written instructions, or ensure that passengers have been briefed
on emergency procedures. This provision is necessary in light of the flotation equipment requirements set forth
in this emergency rule.



Related Rulemaking



This SFAR is an emergency final rule addressing air tour operations in the State of Hawaii in light of the increasing
frequency of accidents. The FAA is considering other rulemaking action to address noise and other issues concerning
sightseeing overflights in national parks and other scenic areas. On March 17, 1994, the FAA and the National Park
Service (NPS) issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (59 FR 12740) seeking public comment on
general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory actions to address the effects of aircraft
overflights on national parks. The FAA is currently analyzing comments submitted in response to the ANPRM. This SFAR
is an emergency rule and not a final action in response to the joint FAA/NPS ANPRM.

The promulgation of requirements and restrictions in this SFAR, including the minimum flight altitude restriction,
does not preclude the FAA from revisiting the issues addressed in the SFAR. As mentioned above, changes to this SFAR
may be necessitated after a review of the comments received from related regulatory proposals. Additionally, this
SFAR may be amended after consideration of the comments received on this SFAR.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et. seq.).



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



Introduction



Changes to Federal regulations are required to undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866
directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. With respect to this rule, the FAA has
determined that it: (1) is ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is significant
as defined in the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) will have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. Therefore,
a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to
this rule, has been prepared. This regulatory evaluation summary presents a concise analysis of the costs and benefits
associated with the final rule that amends the Federal Aviation Regulations by establishing certain operational,
procedural, and equipment requirements for air tour operators in the State of Hawaii.



Costs



The FAA estimates the total cost of the SFAR to be about $2.0 million, with a present value of $1.8 million (7 percent
discount rate), from 1995 to 1997. The FAA assumes that air tour operators will elect to have lifevests on board the
helicopter rather than installing external flotation gear because the costs are dramatically lower. This present
value cost includes the cost of about $190,000 to provide lifevests on the affected helicopters; the potential of
$1.6 million in lost revenue to air tour operators due to minimum flight altitudes; and $10,000 for the development
of a helicopter performance plan. Other requirements of the rule_helicopter operating limitations and passenger
briefing_will impose little if any cost.

Benefits 



Since 1982, Hawaiian air tour operators have experienced 15 accidents involving at least one serious injury or fatality
where the lack of flotation gear, flying into bad weather, or flying low has played a role in the cause of the accident.
These accidents have resulted in 48 fatalities and 30 injuries (16 serious and 14 minor). This evaluation divides
these accidents into three categories: (1) Inadvertent air tour helicopter water landings without flotation gear;
(2) air tour helicopter accidents related to flying into bad weather or flying low; and, (3) air tour airplane accidents
related to flying into bad weather or flying low. 



The potential benefits of preventing all potential sightseeing accidents of a similar nature over the next 3 years
totals $36.8 million, with a present value of about $32.2 million, of which $13.7 million would be for the prevention
of helicopter accidents and $18.6 million would be for the prevention of airplane accidents. 



Regulatory Flexibility Determination 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) helps to assure that Federal regulations do not overly burden small businesses,
small nonprofit organizations, and airports located in small cities. The RFA requires regulatory agencies to review
rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' A substantial number
of small entities, defined by FAA Order 2100.14A, ``Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance,'' is more than
one-third, but not less than 11, of the small entities subject to the existing rule. To determine if the rule will impose
a significant cost impact on these small entities, the annualized cost must not exceed the annualized cost threshold
established in FAA Order 2100.14A. 

Small entities potentially affected by the final rule are small on-demand air tour operators in Hawaii using helicopter
and fixed-wing aircraft. The FAA assumes that air tour operators will elect to have lifevests on board the helicopter
rather than installing external flotation gear because the costs are dramatically lower. The FAA estimates that
the annualized cost associated with acquiring lifevests for all helicopter occupants is about $127 per seat. This
estimate incorporates the cost of purchasing the lifevests, maintenance, and the associated weight penalty. Also,
the FAA estimates that the annualized cost of the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement is about $989 per seat.
This cost incorporates the estimated lost profits for days when tour operations are prohibited due to inclement weather.


FAA Order 2100.14A defines small on-demand operators as those operating with a fleet of nine or fewer aircraft, which
includes 37 (7 fixed-wing and 30 helicopter) of the 38 air tour operators in Hawaii. The annualized cost threshold
for small operators is $4,700 in 1994 dollars. The FAA has determined that the final rule will have a significant economic
effect on 6 of the 7 fixed-wing air tour operators and 25 of the 30 affected helicopter air tour operators. The final
rule will impose costs greater than the annualized cost threshold of $4,700 for all affected operators except for
six of the small air tour operators. 

Due to the significant economic impact of the final rule on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA examined
an alternative minimum altitude requirement for the affected operators. The FAA evaluated various minimum altitude
requirements including 500, 800, and 1,000 feet so as to reduce the annualized cost of the final rule on individual
operators. The FAA has determined that a minimum altitude requirement of 500 feet will be necessary to lower the annualized
cost of the final rule below the $4,700 threshold for most air tour operators. (Under  91.155, pilots conducting
VFR flights more than 1,200 feet above the surface in class G airspace must maintain a 500-foot vertical clearance
below the clouds. Pilots operating VFR in class G airspace 1,200 feet or less above the surface must remain clear of
clouds.) The FAA estimates that the annualized cost of a 500-foot minimum altitude requirement is about $81 per seat.
Including the cost of the lifevests, the FAA has determined that the combined cost of the lifevests and the alternative
requirement for a 500-foot minimum altitude will lower the annualized cost below the $4,700 threshold for all fixed-wing
air tour operators and 26 of the 30 helicopter air tour operators.

The FAA has evaluated the level of safety for the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement in the final rule and that
provided by a 500-foot minimum altitude requirement. Although the 1,500-foot minimum altitude requirement has
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, it provides operational safety superior
to that provided by a 500-foot minimum altitude and is necessary in the public interest. With the 1,500-foot minimum
altitude, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters have a longer power off gliding time, and the pilots are better
