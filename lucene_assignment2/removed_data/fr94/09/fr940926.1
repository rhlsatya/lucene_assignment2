OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Temporary, Seasonal, and Intermittent Employment in the Excepted Service



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise its regulations to consolidate excepted service authorities
for filling temporary, intermittent, and seasonal jobs, to remove coverage for appointments that no longer meet
the criteria for exception, and to establish a new excepted service authority which could be used by agencies to meet
urgent, short-term hiring needs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This proposal is the second step in OPM's program to simplify temporary hiring authorities and ensure their appropriate
use. Regulations were proposed on February 1, 1994, (59 FR 4601) to set a uniform service limit for temporary appointments
in both the competitive and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension. The regulations now
proposed would revise and consolidate paragraphs (i) and (m) of  213.3102, which both cover temporary, intermittent,
and seasonal employment in the excepted service. The revision would eliminate overlapping and obsolete appointing
authorities.



In July 1993, OPM advised all agencies that use Schedule A authorities which were established specifically for temporary
or seasonal employment that, if they wished to retain the authorities, they would need to justify why examining for
the positions is impracticable. Our intent was to identify the situations where excepted service hiring is appropriate
and to replace individual agencies' authorities with a Governmentwide authority that could be used by any agency
in those situations. However, agencies reported only one situation that would have general applicability and one
that may have general applicability. The rest are so agency-specific that creation of a Governmentwide authority
would serve no practical purpose.



Temporary and less-than-full-time hiring in remote locations. 

Several agencies need to hire short-term or supplemental staff, often on short notice, in locations that are remote
or isolated from a population center. Examining for these jobs is impracticable when: Only residents of the immediate
area can be expected to reach the work site whenever they are needed; the amount of employment involved would not encourage
outside applicants to move to the isolated area; and staff from an OPM or agency examining office could not readily
reach the location to administer tests or conduct recruiting. 

We propose to establish a Schedule A authority that would define ``remote/isolated location'' and would limit excepted
employment to 1,040 working hours in a service year. Any agency could use the authority, without prior OPM approval,
for jobs that meet the conditions set out in the regulation.



Urgent, short-term hiring needs. 

OPM is abolishing the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), as recommended by the National Performance Review. OPM has
granted certain authorities to agencies through the FPM that are not specifically reflected in regulations. One
of those authorities (set out in section 2-9 of FPM Chapter 316) allows agencies to make temporary appointments
not to exceed 30 days and to extend those appointments for no more than 30 additional days without regard to normal appointment
procedures. Unless that authority is incorporated in a regulation, it will be lost when FPM Chapter 316 is abolished
in December 1994.

We believe the special need authority serves a valid purpose and should be continued as an excepted service appointing
authority. (Competitive requirements have never applied to special need appointments.) Service limits and conditions
for use of the current special need authority would remain the same. The new Schedule A authority would be available
for use by any agency without prior OPM approval. 



Fellowships and related programs. 

Three agencies suggested creation of a Governmentwide authority covering post-doctoral fellowships, internships,
and similar programs designed to increase the pool of candidates in a particular specialty for all employers, not
just the Federal Government. On May 13, 1994, we published proposed regulations that would create a consolidated
authority for employment of students. However, several agencies have internship or fellowship programs that provide
professional experience to individuals who have completed their formal education.

We agree that a consolidated authority for those appointments would be appropriate. We expect to consider consolidation
of most Schedule A and B appointing authorities_not only those covering temporary hiring_and may propose creation
of a fellowship authority. In the meantime, however, we are not sure that such an authority should be restricted to
temporary employment. Many appointments under existing programs are made for periods longer than 1 year.

Consequently, we have not included a specific provision for internship or fellowship appointments in the proposed
authority for temporary Schedule A appointments. We welcome your comments on this issue, however, and will add such
a provision if there is sufficient interest. If there is not enough interest to justify a Governmentwide authority,
we would entertain requests for single-agency exceptions from agencies wishing to establish temporary fellowship
programs.

Other positions. 

Several agencies reported specific situations in which competitive hiring procedures would not be appropriate
or effective. However, because each of these situations is unique to the agency involved, issuance of Governmentwide
Schedule A authorities would serve no practical purpose. Therefore, the proposed regulation would provide for exception
of additional positions with prior OPM approval.

Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR part 213 as follows:



PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE



1. The authority citation for part 213 is revised to read as follows:








Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302, E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218;  213.101 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 2103;
 213.3102 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302 (E.O. 12364, 47 FR 22931), 3307, 8337(h), and 8456.





2. In  213.3102, paragraph (i) is revised and paragraph (m) is removed and reserved, as follows:



 213.3102

Entire executive civil service.


* * * * *



(i) Temporary and less-than-full-time positions, as follows:

(1) Positions in remote/isolated locations where examination is impracticable. A remote/isolated location is
outside the local commuting area of a population center from which an employee can reasonably be expected to travel
on short notice under adverse weather and/or road conditions which are normal for the area. For this purpose, a population
center is a town with housing, schools, health care, stores and other businesses in which the servicing examining
office can schedule tests and/or reasonably expect to attract applicants. An individual appointed under this authority
may not be employed in the same agency under a combination of this and any other appointment for more than 1,040 working
hours in a service year. Temporary appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments, with no
limit on the number of such extensions, as an exception to the service limits in  213.104.

(2) Positions for which a critical hiring need exists. This includes both short-term positions and continuing positions
that an agency must fill on an interim basis pending completion of competitive examining, clearances, or other procedures
required for a longer appointment. Appointments under this authority may not exceed 30 days and may be extended for
up to an additional 30 days if continued employment is essential to the agency's operations. The appointments may
not be used to extend the service limit of any other appointing authority. An agency may not employ the same individual
under this authority for more than 60 days in any 12-month period.

(3) Other positions for which OPM determines that examining is impracticable.

Housing for Older Persons: Defining Significant Facilities and Services; Notice of Extension of Public Comment
Deadline on Proposed Rule; and Change in Location of Phoenix AZ Public Meeting


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Extension of Public Comment Deadline on Proposed Rule; and Change in Location of Public Meeting in Phoenix,
AZ.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On July 7, 1994, HUD published a proposed rule that would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules defining what are
`significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons'
required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older persons'
in such section.'' The July 7, 1994 proposed rule provided for the public comment period to expire on October 5, 1994.
This notice extends the public comment period to November 30, 1994.


Additionally, on August 9, 1994, HUD published a notice announcing four public meetings to be held across the country
to discuss the July 7, 1994 proposed rule and to provide an additional opportunity for members of the public to submit
comments on the rule. This notice also advises of a change in location for the Phoenix, AZ public meeting.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34902), HUD published a proposed rule that would implement the rulemaking required by section
919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules
defining what are `significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs
of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing
for older persons' in such section.'' The regulations governing ``housing for older persons'' are codified in 24
CFR part 100, subpart E, and the July 7, 1994 proposed rule (also referred to as the ``Significant Facilities proposed
rule'') would amend subpart E to provide the definitions required by section 919.


Extension of Public Comment Period



The July 7, 1994 proposed rule provided for a 90-day public comment period which is scheduled to close on October 5,
1994. Because of the significant public interest in this rule, HUD is extending the public comment period to November
30, 1994.


Change in Location of Phoenix, AZ Meeting


Additionally, on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40502), HUD published a notice announcing four public meetings to be held across
the country to discuss the Significant Facilities proposed rule and to provide an additional opportunity for members
of the public to submit comments on the rule.
The August 9, 1994 notice announced that public meetings would be held in Fontana, CA, on August 15, 1994; Tampa, FL,
on August 25, 1994; Phoenix, AZ on September 29, 1994; and Washington, DC, on October 6, 1994. This notice advises of
a change in location for the Phoenix, AZ public meeting.
The September 29, 1994 meeting in Phoenix, AZ, will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the Grand Ballroom), 111
North Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85004.

Reform of Federal Student Aid for Postsecondary Education and Training 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of regional meetings.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education will convene four public meetings to obtain public comment
for use in the development of policies relating to reform of Federal student aid for postsecondary education and training.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In order to increase the opportunity for public participation in the development of policies relating to the reform
of Federal student aid for postsecondary education and training, the Assistant Secretary is convening a series of
meetings in different parts of the country and invites individuals and representatives of groups involved in student
financial assistance programs to attend these meetings. The Secretary particularly encourages students, legal
assistance organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, guaranty agencies and lenders
to attend and participate in these meetings. These regional meetings are convened to discuss only reform of Federal
student aid programs for postsecondary education and training. 



To facilitate discussion, the Assistant Secretary has identified three major areas for discussion: (a) Can Federal
student aid be better targeted to ensure access to postsecondary education? (b) Can postsecondary vocational education
and training better meet the needs and objectives of students and institutions? (c) Can regulatory and administrative
simplicity help institutions better fulfill their educational missions and target their resources on educational
rather than administrative tasks? 

More specifically, the Assistant Secretary seeks comments, ideas, and suggestions on the following issues: 

(a) Would providing a larger amount of aid to poor students improve access and encourage persistence in postsecondary
education? 

(b) Would establishing a guaranteed amount of Federal aid that would be available to every individual promote better
awareness of and access to postsecondary education? 

(c) Would a merit-based supplement to need-based aid encourage students to excel academically and better position
them to reap the rewards of postsecondary education? 

(d) How can the Department of Education better interact with the States and other Federal agencies to improve access
to and excellence in postsecondary education? 

(e) What strategies for skills training and workforce preparation are most effective? 

(f) How should the Federal government support basic education for disadvantaged adults? 

(g) Should there be separate student aid programs for vocational study compared with collegiate programs? How would
a vocational program be defined? 

(h) What is the best way to coordinate among various local, State, and Federal programs that offer vocational education?


(i) Would different rules and regulations for different groups of institutions assist in providing institutions
the flexibility to accomplish their educational mission? 

(j) How could administrative workload be reduced while maintaining or improving accountability to taxpayers? 

(k) What information is essential to collect from institutions and students to ensure accountability and integrity
of programs, while reducing the overall reporting burden? 

(l) What performance measures should the Department use as a measure of institutional ability to reduce the regulatory
burden of administering the student aid programs? 

Participants are welcome to raise other issues relating to Federal student aid programs in addition to the above questions.
The dates and location of the four regional meetings appear below. 

(a) October 5, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., University of Washington, Husky Union Building (HUB) Auditorium, Seattle,
Washington. 

(b) October 13, 1994, 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., Kansas City Convention Center, Bartle Hall, 301 West 13th Street, Room
1204-North Side, Kansas City, Missouri. 

(c) October 28, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., Northeastern University, the Student Center Ballroom, Boston, Massachusetts.


(d) November 2, 1994, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., Georgia State University, The Urban Life Conference Center, Atlanta,

Proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this document is to announce the extension of the comment period for receiving comments on the three
reports announced in the August 30, 1994, 

Federal Register

 that EPA is considering as it develops the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (Guidance). The
proposed Guidance was published in the April 16, 1993, 

Federal Register

, with corrections published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 9, 1993, and September 13, 1993. 


On August 30, 1994, EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of data availability and request for comments on three reports that it is considering in developing the final
Guidance. The three reports made available in the August 30, 1994, notice are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning
the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991-1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption
Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation
Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has adequate opportunity to comment on whether any of the
recommendations in these reports should be adopted in developing the final Great Lakes Water Quality Guidance.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA announced the availability of three reports in the August 30, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44678). The three reports are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater
Toxicity Tests''; ``1991-1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality
Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994,'' have
been placed in the administrative record for the Great Lakes Guidance because EPA is considering information in these
documents as it finalizes the Great Lakes Guidance. A summary of the information provided in these three reports and
the issues relevant to the Great Lakes Guidance are discussed in the August 30, 1994, notice. Readers are referred
to that notice for additional details. 


In this notice, EPA is extending the public comment period for the three reports to October 14, 1994, to provide additional
time for public review and comment. EPA believes that extension of the comment period for this limited purpose is appropriate
because of the complexity of the issues raised in the three reports announced on August 30, 1994.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Small Business Subcontracting Reporting (SF 295)


AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council have agreed to a proposed
rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to authorize the addition of a column to the Standard Form 295,
Summary Subcontract Report, to report the number of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small disadvantaged
business concerns, and women-owned small business enterprises. This regulatory action was subject to Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued Policy Letter 91-1, Governmentwide Small Business
and Small Disadvantaged Business Goals for Procurement Contracts, which requires agencies to report the number
and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and
women-owned small businesses. Currently, the SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report, which is used to compile agency-wide
data for subcontracting programs, collects dollar value of subcontracts awarded but does not collect the number
of subcontracts awarded.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because small businesses are exempt from the requirement to submit the report form. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5
U.S.C. 601, 

et seq. 

(FAR Case 91-78), in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a revised information collection requirement
concerning Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 9000-0007 is being submitted to OMB under 44
U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq. 

Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a 

Federal Register

 notice appearing in this same issue.

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice follows NHTSA's partial granting of a petition filed by Michael Robinson, Director, Michigan Department
of State Police. The petitioner suggested making mandatory the standardized display of a permanent metal vehicle
manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of over 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000
pounds (lb)). The petitioner suggested that the label be fabricated of a minimum gauge metal with raised or recessed
letters and numbers, be riveted to the vehicle body at specified standard locations and, in the case of trailers, be
given reasonable protection from damage. 


The agency proposes to amend its vehicle certification regulation to require the standardized display of a permanent
metal vehicle manufacturer's label for all motor vehicles with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The label
would contain the same information as currently required, with either raised or recessed letters, and be riveted
or otherwise permanently secured to the vehicle at specified locations. The petitioner's suggestions that the label
be constructed of a specified heavy gauge metal and that the label on trailers be given special protection are denied.

I. Background 


Part 567, Certification, sets forth the agency's requirements for the content and location of the label certifying
the compliance of a motor vehicle with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The regulation requires manufacturers
of motor vehicles, except vehicles manufactured in two or more stages, to affix a label to each vehicle they produce
containing the information relating to that vehicle required by  567.4(g). The labels are not required to be
made out of any particular type of material but, unless riveted, must be permanently affixed so that they cannot be
removed without destroying or defacing them.

<PARENT> FR940926-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For motor vehicles other than trailers and motorcycles, the label shall be affixed either to the hinge pillar, door-latch
post, or the door edge that meets the door-latch post next to the driver's seating position. If those locations are
not practicable, the label may be placed on the left side of the instrument panel or if that is not practicable, the inward-facing
surface of the door next to the driver's seating position. If none of the above locations are practicable, the manufacturer
must notify NHTSA of that fact and, with appropriate drawings or photographs, suggest an alternative location. Such
suggestion must be submitted for approval to the Administrator, NHTSA. Whatever its location, the label must be easily
readable without moving any part of the vehicle except the outer door, and the lettering on the label must be of a color
that contrasts with the label's background. 
Trailer labels must be located on the left forward half of the vehicle. Labels on motorcycles must be affixed to a permanent
member of the vehicle and as close as possible to the intersection of the steering post with the handle bars. 
49 CFR 567.5 prescribes the labeling requirements for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages. Section 567.5(a)
requires chassis-cab manufacturers to affix a label in the form and location specified in  567.4 to each chassis-cab
manufactured by them. Section 567.5(b) requires intermediate-stage manufacturers to affix a label in the form and
location specified in  567.4 to each chassis-cab to which they are required to furnish an addendum to the incomplete
vehicle document prescribed in  568.4, if such chassis-cab has been certified by its manufacturer in accordance
with  567.5(a). 
Finally,  567.5(c) requires final-stage manufacturers to affix a label of the type and in the manner and form
specified in  567.4 to each vehicle, containing the information specified in that section relating to that
vehicle. 


II. The Petition 


Michael Robinson, Director of the Michigan Department of State Police, petitioned the agency to amend  567.4
to require that manufacturers' labels on vehicles weighing more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) be made of a heavy gauge metal
of a specified thickness with raised or recessed letters and numbers and be riveted to the vehicle. He further suggested
that the labels be located on the door latch post near the driver's seating position. If that is not practicable, then
he wanted the label to be placed on a permanent vertical section of the cab's floor area to the left of the driver's seating
position and which would be immediately visible with the driver's side door open. If that location is still not practicable,
he wanted the label to be affixed to the portion of the instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel. He suggested
that the label for a bus be affixed, if practicable, to the ceiling area above the windshield or windows in the driver's
seating area. If none of the suggested locations are practicable, then the manufacturer must notify NHTSA as currently
required by  567.4(c). 
Mr. Robinson stated that he submitted his petition because the Motor Carrier Division of his Department has identified
a significant problem in locating information on the gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) and vehicle identification
numbers (VIN) of commercial vehicles. He asserted that there are currently no Federal standards requiring labels
of standard size, thickness, or format displaying either the GVWR or the VIN on commercial vehicles. Under current
requirements, the label containing that information may be located in any one of several different places and in one
of several different formats, including decals, adhesive labels, and riveted metal plates. Mr. Robinson alluded
to the current requirement that each vehicle have a label showing the GVWR and VIN affixed when the vehicle is manufactured,
but stated that there is no Federal requirement that the label remain affixed thereafter. Thus, the labels on many
vehicles either fall off or are otherwise removed or obliterated after manufacture, usually by accident. 
Mr. Robinson stated that prior to the inception of the Commercial Driver License (CDL) requirements, the GVWR was
not normally used by law enforcement officers. Now, however, it is very important for officers to be able to determine
the GVWR of commercial vehicles. Under the CDL program, drivers are licensed to operate only those vehicles within
the GVWR ranges of vehicles for which the drivers have met the qualifications. Law enforcement officers often have
difficulty determining the GVWRs of commercial vehicles because the labels on those vehicles are often damaged,
painted over or removed, usually accidently, during the life of the vehicle. The reason for the absence of the GVWRs
is that many labels are not designed or constructed to hold up under the rigors of commercial vehicle operation. 
The petitioner asserted that the manufacturer's label is a prime source of the VIN and the only means that law enforcement
officers have to determine the GVWR of a given vehicle. Without the GVWR, police officers who are unfamiliar with commercial
vehicle operation are unable to determine the CDL GVWR range into which a particular vehicle falls. In such a case,
officers cannot determine the correct enforcement action. As a result, drivers may be allowed to continue operating
vehicles which they are not qualified to operate. Thus, with more certain access to VIN and GVWR information, police
officers could more readily inspect and investigate commercial vehicles during routine traffic stops. 
Mr. Robinson further stated that a review of reports about truck and bus accidents over the several months prior to
submission of the petition revealed a large number of discrepancies in entries in the reports regarding the GVWR,
presumably stemming from the investigating officers' inability to locate or read the vehicle label. He argued that
this difficulty results in collection of erroneous data which is then submitted to the SAFETYNET data management
system established and maintained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The SAFETYNET system is a cooperative
effort to share commercial vehicle data electronically between the FHWA and the various states. 
On another point, Mr. Robinson stated that as of July, 1991, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) estimated
that approximately 10,494 commercial trucks and 18,865 commercial-type trailers were classified as unrecovered
stolen vehicles in the United States. He argued that identification and recovery of those vehicles is greatly hampered
by the lack of uniform display of VINs on commercial vehicles. He believed that if a more standardized and permanent
manufacturer's label were used on commercial vehicles, law enforcement personnel could more easily and reliably
inspect and identify commercial vehicles and could possibly locate and recover many more of such vehicles. 


III. Analysis of the Petition 


Although NHTSA has no independent information indicating a problem in determining the GVWR of commercial vehicles
in use or, if there is such a problem, its magnitude, the agency nevertheless has no reason to doubt Mr. Robinson's assertions.
Further, if the problem exists in Michigan, it is reasonable to assume that it exists in other states.

The apparent existence of this problem concerns the agency. For example, the Surface Transportation Assistance
Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. App. at section 2302, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to states
for enforcement programs applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety. Pursuant to that authority, the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) established the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) (49 CFR 350). MCSAP
provides grants to states to support a national motor carrier safety enforcement program. The program is designed
to reduce the number and severity of accidents and hazardous materials incidents of commercial motor vehicles by
substantially increasing the level and effectiveness of enforcement activity and the likelihood that safety defects,
driver deficiencies, and unsafe carrier practices will be detected and corrected. The increasing Federal and state
involvement in that program has led to a corresponding increase in the number of functions common to both Federal and
state officers. This increase has, in turn, led to an increasing need for efficient communications and exchange of
accurate data. SAFETYNET, therefore, has become even more important to this effort by combining all functions into
a single user-friendly data-sharing system for the use of both Federal and state personnel involved in commercial
motor carrier operations. 
A typical SAFETYNET profile consists, among other things, of the type of operation, GVWR, cargo, any accident data,
inspection data including any violations and out-of-service actions, work performance reports, and data entry
verification. Thus, if law enforcement officers are collecting incomplete or incorrect data because of lack of GVWR
information, as Mr. Robinson asserts, the effectiveness of the SAFETYNET system could be compromised. 
The agency agrees that, assuming the accuracy of the petitioner's figures relating to stolen vehicles, a permanent
metal label could assist in the identification and recovery of at least some of the great number of unrecovered stolen
commercial vehicles in the United States. 
FHWA has informed NHTSA that it supports the suggestions in Mr. Robinson's petition, believing that a permanent metal
label will help enforce Federal as well as state motor carrier safety regulations. While the petitioner's primary
focus seems to be enforcement of CDL requirements, FHWA believes that the importance of this rulemaking is broader
in scope than that. The gross vehicle weight rating (or gross combination weight rating (GCWR) for a combination vehicle)
is one of three independent criteria used to determine the applicability of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
(FMCSR) for vehicles and drivers engaged in interstate commerce. The FMCSRs cover driver qualifications, hours
of service, accident record keeping, vehicle inspection, repair and maintenance, controlled substances and alcohol
testing, in addition to the CDL. The GVWR/GCWR weight threshold for the general applicability of the FMCSRs is 10,001
pounds. The recently published final rules on controlled substances and alcohol testing apply to every person who
operates a commercial vehicle in interstate or intrastate commerce, and is subject to the CDL requirements of 49 CFR
383. Part 383 includes a 26,001 pound threshold as one if its applicability criteria. The FHWA believes, therefore,
that implementing the suggestions in this petition will help motor carriers in identifying vehicles and drivers
that are subject to the FMCSRs and Federal and state officials responsible for enforcing the regulations. The permanent
metal labels should provide more comprehensive enforcement of such regulations by making possible better identification
of the vehicles concerned. FHWA also expressed support for the petitioner's suggestion that the labels on trailers
be given reasonable protection since trailer labels are particularly susceptible to damage during commercial vehicle
operations. 
Mr. Robinson suggested that the thickness of the metal label be specified. NHTSA does not believe that is necessary,
at least not at this time. NHTSA tentatively concludes that the primary benefit is to be obtained from specifying the
use of a metal label. The agency has no information indicating that specifying a particular minimum thickness would
increase that benefit significantly. NHTSA understands the petitioner's reasoning that a label of a specified heavy
gauge would be more durable and more likely to survive the rigors of commercial operation. On the other hand, the agency
also believes that manufacturers must have the flexibility to accommodate the thickness of the labels to the door
designs of the various vehicles they produce. NHTSA is confident that manufacturers will affix labels whose sturdiness
is consistent with the designs of their vehicles. If, in the future, information obtained from actual commercial
vehicle experience indicates that it might be appropriate to specify a minimum thickness, appropriate rulemaking
action can be taken at that time. 
The agency questions whether the petitioner's four suggested permissible locations for the labels on vehicles other
than trailers are too limited as compared to the five permissible locations currently allowed. In addition, the petitioner
suggested the floor area as a permissible location for the label. The agency is concerned that locating the label on
the vehicle floor or even on the instrument panel could place the inspecting officer in an awkward position, perhaps
even in jeopardy, by having to lean into the cab of the truck and turn his or her head to read the label. Further, the possibly
limited ambient light on the vehicle floor could make it difficult for an inspector to read a label there. On the other
hand, inspecting officers routinely stand on the running boards of trucks to check inside for the driver's log, labels,
as well as for drugs and/or alcohol. Thus, a label on the floor or the instrument panel could normally be seen by the inspector
from the running board.

The petitioner also suggested locating the label for buses inside the vehicle and above the driver's side windshield
or window. NHTSA has no objection to that. The agency's purpose in specifying the locations for the manufacturer's
certification label was to provide an unobstructed view of the label, i.e., to ensure that the labels are easy to see
and read in any vehicle. Since it is not practicable to inspect buses with passengers on board, buses are usually mounted
on hoists or platforms for inspection either at the beginning or at the end of their runs. Therefore, the inspectors
usually walk through buses during their inspections, making the label easily visible to the inspector if it is mounted
on or above the driver's side windshield or window as the petitioner suggested.

NHTSA recognizes the merit in the petitioner's suggestion that the location of the label should be standardized in
only a limited number of places so that there would be greater predictability about precisely where law enforcement
personnel can expect to find the label. Nevertheless, NHTSA solicits comments on whether the permissible locations
of the permanent metal label, including those on buses, should be standardized as proposed by the petitioner, or whether
the larger number of permissible locations should be maintained as currently allowed. NHTSA further solicits comments
on the locations in which labels should be permitted, if not in the currently-permitted locations or in the locations
suggested by the petitioner.

Finally, Mr. Robinson suggested that the labels for trailers be located so as to provide reasonable protection from
damage. NHTSA does not believe that this change is necessary at this time. NHTSA believes that specifying a permanent
metal label with either raised or recessed letters and numbers, riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to the vehicle,
would sufficiently enhance the durability of the label on trailers to make the data readable even after many years
of use. Again, should actual experience in the future indicate that further action is appropriate to protect trailer
labels, rulemaking can be initiated at that time. 

NHTSA made a preliminary cost analysis of the proposed requirements. The analysis suggests that the incremental
cost range of metal labels as proposed would be between $0.25 and $2.50 per label, depending on size, thickness, and
quantity ordered. NHTSA estimates that for those manufacturers that purchase labels in large quantities, the incremental
cost could range between $0.25 and $0.75. For those manufacturers that would purchase labels in smaller quantities,
the cost range could be between $2.00 and $2.50 per label. 

Label manufacturers typically put only certain information on labels. The vehicle manufacturer then applies the
remainder of the required information at the plant, such as the GVWR, GAWR, VIN, etc. Thus, if letters and numbers are
raised or recessed, vehicle manufacturers, as well as possibly some label manufacturers, may have to purchase the
equipment to emboss the metal labels at a cost of between $300 and $1,500. 

Agency data shows that 263,580 motor vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) and 126,904 trailers were
sold in 1992. Another 35,444 school buses, which would also be included in the vehicles covered by this notice, were
sold in 1991, bringing the combined total affected vehicles to approximately 425,928. The agency has no data on how
many vehicles, if any, already meet the proposed requirements. Assuming that none do, the agency calculates that
the total range of incremental annual costs of this proposal would be $106,482 to $1,064,810. 



V. Issues for NHTSA Evaluation 



In order to obtain additional data for the agency's evaluation of the issues raised by this petition, NHTSA solicits
comments on the following specific issues regarding certification labels: 

1. Is there a problem with manufacturers' labels on motor vehicles with a GVWR of over 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) becoming
obliterated, painted over, or otherwise rendered illegible during the service life of the vehicle? If so, in what
percentage of those vehicles does this occur? Are particular types, brands, models, or model years of vehicles more
susceptible to this problem than others? 

2. What costs do manufacturers currently incur in the purchase, printing, and application of labels?

3. What sorts of materials are currently utilized for the labels on vehicles with GVWR more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb)?
What percent of currently utilized labels are made of metal? 

4. What sizes are the labels currently affixed to motor vehicles with GVWR of more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb)? How are
they affixed? 

5. What incremental costs would vehicle manufacturers incur to purchase, emboss, and affix permanent metal labels
with raised or recessed letters and numbers as proposed? 

6. What incremental costs, if any, would label manufacturers incur in producing metal labels with raised or recessed
letters and numbers? 

7. In what quantities do vehicle manufacturers currently order labels? 

8. How much time is currently required for vehicle manufacturers to prepare and affix labels? 

9. How much time would be required for vehicle manufacturers to rivet or otherwise permanently affix metal labels
as proposed? 

10. What special problems, if any, would vehicle manufacturers have in affixing permanent metal labels as proposed?


11. Should a particular metal, such as aluminum, stainless steel, etc., be specified for the labels? 

12. Should a minimum thickness be prescribed for the labels?

13. Should a minimum size be specified for the labels? 

14. Should a minimum height or depth be specified for the letters and numbers embossed on the labels? 

15. Should any information be added to or deleted from that currently required to appear on the label? 

16. Should trailers with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less also meet the requirements being proposed for large trailers?


17. Should the agency require some different approach, other than the proposed metal label requirement, for preserving
VIN labels? 



V. Agency Proposal 



Based on the assertions by Mr. Robinson in his petition and the analysis discussed above, NHTSA proposes to amend 49
CFR 567.4 to require that, for vehicles with GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb), the manufacturer's certification
label required by that part be made of metal. The agency also proposes that the letters and numbers on the label be raised
or recessed, and that the label be riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to each vehicle in the locations suggested
by the petitioner. 

The agency believes that by requiring permanent metal labels, commercial vehicle safety would be enhanced by ensuring
that commercial vehicles are being driven by drivers who are duly qualified and licensed to operate them. This would
have the effect of identifying and removing unfit and unqualified drivers from the nation's highways, thereby enhancing
the safety of the motoring public. In addition, a permanent metal label on which the GVWR and VIN remain legible throughout
all or the greater part of the service life of a commercial vehicle would help to ensure that the information supplied
to the SAFETYNET system would be more accurate, thus contributing directly to the enforcement efforts discussed
above.

Further, to reflect rulemaking conducted by the agency pursuant to the Imported Vehicles Safety Compliance Act of
1988, Pub. L. 100-562, 102 Stat. 2818 (49 U.S.C. 30141, 30146), NHTSA proposes to amend existing  567.4(k)
to substitute ``49 CFR 591.5(f)'' in place of the current ``19 CFR 12.80(b)(1).'' 



VI. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



A. EO 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This notice was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact associated with this rulemaking action
and has concluded that it is not significant under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures.
As explained above, this action merely would require that the motor vehicle manufacturer's label, which is already
required for all motor vehicles, be made of metal and be permanently affixed to those vehicles with a GVWR greater than
4,536 kg (10,000 lb). The costs would range from $0.25 to $2.50 per vehicle, for a total incremental annual cost of between
$106,482 and $1,064,820. NHTSA has concluded, therefore, that the effect of this proposed action would be so minimal
as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis. 

The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses, although some label
manufacturers might so qualify. Those small businesses would be affected only to the extent that they may be required
to purchase equipment to emboss information on metal labels, if they do not already have such equipment, at a one-time
cost of between $300 and $1,500. Such cost could be amortized over the life of the equipment, and/or passed on to customers
and, eventually, to consumers. Small organizations and small governmental units would be affected by the proposed
amendment only to the extent of having to pay an additional $0.25 to $2.50 per large vehicle. 



C. National Environmental Policy Act 



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act and has determined
that implementation of this action would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. 



D. EO 12612 (Federalism) 



NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of
a Federalism Assessment. 



E. Civil Justice Reform 



The proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable
to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal standard. However,
the United States Government, a state, or a political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard for a motor vehicle
or item of motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement than that
required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing,
amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other administrative
proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court.

 567.4 

Requirements for manufacturers of motor vehicles. 


(a) Each manufacturer of motor vehicles (except vehicles manufactured in two or more stages) shall affix to each vehicle
a label, of the type and in the manner described below, containing the statements specified in paragraph (j) of this
section. 
(b) The location of the label shall be such that it is clearly visible and easily readable without moving any part of
the vehicle except an outer door. 
(c) For motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000 pounds
(lb)) and all trailers, the label shall be fabricated of metal, with raised or recessed letters and numbers, and, except
for trailers, shall be riveted or otherwise permanently affixed to the vehicle in one of the locations specified in
paragraph (e) of this section. 
(d) For motor vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, the label shall, unless riveted, be permanently affixed
in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing it. 
(e)(1) For motor vehicles with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) other than buses and trailers, the label shall
be riveted to the door latch post next to the driver's seating position. If that location is not practicable, then to
a permanent vertical position of the cab floor area to the left of the driver's seating position. If that location is
not practicable, the label shall be riveted to the left side of the instrument panel, left of the steering wheel. 
(2) For buses, the label shall be riveted to the ceiling area above the windshield or window(s) in the driver's seating
area. 

(3) If none of the preceding locations are practicable, notification of that fact, together with drawings or photographs
showing a suggested alternate location in the same general area, shall be submitted for approval to the Administrator,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, Washington, DC 20590. 
(f) For motor vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, except trailers and motorcycles, the label shall
be affixed either to the hinge pillar, door latch post, or the door edge that meets the door latch post, next to the driver's
seating position, or if none of these locations are practicable, to the left side of the instrument panel. If the latter
location is not practicable, the label shall be affixed to the inward-facing surface of the door next to the driver's
seating position. If none of the preceding locations are 
practicable, notification of that fact shall be submitted to the Administrator, NHTSA, as provided in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section. 

(g) The label for trailers shall be affixed to a location on the forward half of the left side, such that it is easily readable
from outside the vehicle without moving any part of the vehicle. 
(h) The label for motorcycles shall be affixed to a permanent member of the vehicle as close as is practicable to the
intersection of the steering post with the handle bars, in a location such that it is easily readable without moving
any part of the vehicle except the steering system.

(i) Except for the label specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the lettering on the label shall be of a color that
contrasts with the background of the label. 

(j) The label shall contain the following statements, in the English language, lettered in block capitals and numerals
not less than three thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown: 
(1) Name of manufacturer: Except as provided in paragraphs (j) (1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, the full corporate
or individual name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as ``Co.''
or ``Inc.'' and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals, may be used. The name
of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words ``Manufactured By'' or ``Mfd By.'' In the case of imported vehicles,
where the label required by this section is affixed by the Registered Importer, the name of the Registered Importer
shall also be placed on the label in the manner described in this paragraph, directly below the name of the final assembler.

(i) If a vehicle is assembled by a corporation that is controlled by another corporation that assumed responsibility
for the conformity with the standards, the name of the controlling corporation may be used. 
(ii) If a vehicle is fabricated and delivered in complete but unassembled form, such that it is designed to be assembled
without special machinery or tools, the fabricator of the vehicle may affix the label and name itself as the manufacturer
for the purposes of this section. 
(iii) If a trailer is sold by a person who is not its manufacturer, but who is engaged in the manufacture of trailers and
assumes legal responsibility for all duties and liabilities imposed by the Act with respect to that trailer, the name
of that person may appear on the label as the manufacturer. In such a case the name shall be preceded by the words ``Responsible
Manufacturer'' or ``Resp Mfr.'' 
(2) Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during which work was completed at the place of main assembly
of the vehicle. It may be spelled out, as ``June 1970,'' or expressed in numerals, as ``670.'' 
(3) ``Gross Vehicle Weight Rating'' or ``GVWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate
weight in pounds shown in parentheses, which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo
load, and 68 kilograms (150 pounds) times the vehicle's designated seating capacity. However, for school buses the
minimum occupant weight shall be 55 kilograms (120 pounds). 
(4) ``Gross Axle Weight Rating'' or ``GAWR,'' followed by the appropriate value in kilograms with the commensurate
weight in pounds shown in parentheses, for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (e.g. front, first intermediate,
second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when
equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may, at the option of the manufacturer, be stated as a single
value, with label indicating to which axles the ratings apply. 


Examples of Combined Ratings 


GAWR: (a) All axles_1850 kg (4080 lb) with 7.00-15 LT (D) tires. 
(b) Front_5442 kg (12,000 lb) with 10.00-20(G) tires. 
First intermediate to rear_6803 kg (15,000 lb) with 12.00-20(H) tires. 



(5) The statement: ``This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards in effect on
the date of manufacture shown above. The expression ``U.S.'' or ``U.S.A.'' may be inserted before the word ``Federal.''

(i) In the case of passenger cars manufactured on or after September 1, 1978, the expression ``and bumper'' shall be
included in the statement following the word ``safety.'' 
(ii) In the case of 1987 and subsequent model year passenger cars manufactured on or after April 24, 1986, the expression
``safety, bumper, and theft prevention'' shall be substituted in the statement for the word ``safety.'' 
(6) Vehicle identification number. 
(7) The type classification of the vehicle as defined in  571.3 of this chapter (e.g. truck, MPV, bus, trailer).

(k) Multiple GVWR-GAWR ratings. 
(1) (For passenger cars only) In cases where different tire sizes are offered as a customer option, a manufacturer
may at his option list more than one set of values for GVWR and GAWR, in response to the requirements of paragraphs (j)
(3) and (4) of this section. If the label shows more than one set of weight rating values, each value shall be followed
by the phrase ``with 

XXXX

 tires,'' inserting the proper tire size designations. A manufacturer may at his option list one or more tire sizes
where only one set of weight ratings is provided. 


Passenger Car Example 


GVWR: 
1995 kg (4400 lb) with G78-14B tires, 2177 kg (4800 lb) with H78-14B tires. 
GAWR: 
Front_907 kg (2000 lb) with G78-14B tires at 165 kPa (24 psi), 990 kg (2200 lb) with H78-14B tires at 165 kPa
(24 psi).

 

Rear_1088 kg (2400 lb) with G78-14B tires at 193 kPa (28 psi), 1179 kg (2600 lb) with H78-14B tires at 193
kPa (28 psi). 




(2) (For multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, trailers, and motorcycles) The manufacturer may, at its
option, list more than one GVWR-GAWR-tire-rim combination on the label, as long as the listing conforms in content
and format to the requirements for tire-rim-inflation information set forth in Standard No. 120 of this chapter ( 571.120).

(3) At the option of the manufacturer, additional GVWR-GAWR ratings for operation of the vehicle at reduced speeds
may be listed at the bottom of the certification label following any information that is required to be listed.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking submitted by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators
(AAMVA) concerning vehicle identification numbers (VINs). One of this agency's Federal motor vehicle safety standards
requires all motor vehicles to have a VIN. In addition, NHTSA's certification regulation requires the certification
label on each motor vehicle to bear that vehicle's VIN. AAMVA suggested that NHTSA amend its certification regulation
to require the VIN of each trailer to be marked in a second location on the trailer to ensure the VIN is present on the vehicle
in the event the certification label becomes illegible or lost. The petitioner also believes marking the VIN in a second
location will help state officials find the VIN during vehicle inspections. 


NHTSA is denying the petition because the agency has an ongoing rulemaking on the issue of improving the permanency
and legibility of vehicle certification labels on trailers and other motor vehicles. Since those labels include
the VIN, possible improvements to certification labels would address petitioner's concerns about the permanency
and legibility of the VIN.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


NHTSA's certification regulation, 49 CFR 567, 

Certification,

 requires motor vehicle manufacturers to affix a certification label to each motor vehicle. The label constitutes
the manufacturer's certification that the vehicle complies with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Section 567.4 specifies where the label must be located and what information it must include. With respect to trailers,
the label must be located on the forward half of the left side of the vehicle such that it is easily readable from outside
the vehicle without moving any part of the vehicle. One of the items of information required to be displayed on the label
is the VIN. 
The VIN is a unique identifier that facilitates NHTSA's analysis of accident data and assessment of vehicle recall
campaigns. Standard No. 115, 

Vehicle Identification Number_Basic Requirements, 

49 CFR 571.115, requires each motor vehicle to have a VIN. It further requires the VIN to be marked clearly and indelibly
either on a part of the vehicle that is not designed to be removed or on a separate plate or label, such as the vehicle certification
label required by 49 CFR 567. 49 CFR 565, 

Vehicle Identification Number_Content Requirements,

 specifies the content and format for the VIN. Among other things, Part 565 requires the VIN to provide information
on the characteristics of the vehicle, such as its gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). 
Since a trailer's VIN is placed on the certification label, the extent to which a trailer's VIN remains legible throughout
the life of the vehicle depends on the permanency of that label. Part 567 specifies that, unless riveted, the label
must be permanently affixed such that it cannot be removed without destroying it ( 567.4(b)). However, Part
567 does not specify any other requirements that ensure the permanency of the certification label, such as requiring
the label to be fabricated from a durable material. 


The Petition 


AAMVA petitioned NHTSA to improve the permanency of the VIN marking. AAMVA petitioned on behalf of its members, state
motor vehicle administrators. They use the VIN to register vehicles, to determine proper ownership of vehicles,
and to find the GVWR that the vehicle manufacturer assigned to the vehicle. The petitioner said that state officials
use the GVWR information for, among other purposes, determining whether a vehicle is overloaded on the highways.
AAMVA suggested that NHTSA require trailers to have the VIN stamped, etched or otherwise permanently marked in a location
other than the certification label. AAMVA stated that certification labels are typically plastic coated and become
illegible with age and exposure to the elements. Thus, the information on the label_particularly the VIN_becomes
``illegible long before the useful life of the trailer'' ends. Petitioner believed that a second VIN marking would
provide a backup means for determining the weight ratings and other pertinent information for the trailer. 


Agency Decision 


NHTSA is denying AAMVA's petition. The petitioner's justification for its suggestion, missing GVWR information,
is being addressed for trailers in a separate NHTSA rulemaking. That rulemaking action seeks to improve the permanency
and legibility of the certification labels used on commercial motor vehicles. It was initiated when NHTSA granted
in part a petition for rulemaking submitted by the Michigan Department of State Police (MDSP). 
The MDSP raised concerns similar to those of the AAMVA regarding the ability of state officials to locate GVWR and VIN
information on commercial vehicles. The MDSP stated that law enforcement officers often have difficulty determining
the GVWRs of commercial vehicles because the labels on those vehicles are often damaged, painted over or removed,
usually accidently, during the life of the vehicle. The petitioner believed that a vehicle's VIN and GVWR information
should be made more accessible and legible on commercial vehicles to enable police officers to more readily inspect
and investigate commercial vehicles during routine traffic stops. Among other things, the MDSP suggested requiring
certification labels for large commercial vehicles, including trailers, to be made of metal, with raised or recessed
letters and numbers (see RIN 2127-AE71). 
In response to the MDSP petition, NHTSA will consider the need to improve the permanency and legibility of the certification
labels for large trailers, and possible ways to improve the labels. Since these labels include the VIN, any improvements
to the certification label will have the effect of improving the permanency and legibility of the VIN. In addition,
NHTSA will request comments in that rulemaking on whether small trailers should also meet the requirements being
proposed for large trailers, and whether some different approach, other than the proposed metal label requirement,
would be more effective for the certification labels. Since that rulemaking will address AAMVA's concerns about
the permanency and legibility of VIN markings, AAMVA's petition is moot.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and extension of public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, gives notice that a
public hearing will be held on the proposed endangered status for the San Diego fairy shrimp, Quino checkerspot butterfly,
Laguna Mountains skipper butterfly, and 

Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

 and on the proposed threatened status for 

Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

. The hearing will allow all interested parties to submit oral or written comments on these proposals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Laguna Mountains skipper, a small butterfly within the skipper family (Hesperiidae), is about 3 centimeters
(cm) (1 inch) in length and distinguished from other subspecies by extensive white wing markings. The Laguna Mountains
skipper occurs in open meadows of pine forest and is currently found at one site in the Laguna Mountains and one site
on Mount Palomar in San Diego County.

The Quino checkerspot, is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch)
in length and checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. The Quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny
openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland habitats of the interior foothills of
southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The Quino checkerspot may have been one of the
most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside Counties during the early part of the twentieth
century. Currently five to six populations remain in San Diego and southern Riverside Counties.

The San Diego fairy shrimp, is a member of the Branchinectidae, a freshwater crustacean, family in the Order Anostraca
(fairy shrimp). It is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming
legs. The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools in San Diego County from San Marcos and Ramona south to
Otay Mesa and at Valle de Palmas in northwestern Baja California, Mexico.



Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

, is a low, blue-flowered annual that is restricted to grassy meadows that are vernally wet (wet during the rainy season)
with saturated soil conditions. It is restricted to the Cuyamaca Valley in the vicinity of Cuyamaca Lake, San Diego
County. 

Limnanthes gracilis

 var. 

parishii,

 is a low, widely-branching annual with white flowers. There are fewer than 20 population of 

L. gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 in the Palomar, Cuyamaca, and Laguna Mountains and on Santa Rosa Plateau. The largest population, which includes
most of the individuals, is found in the Cuyamaca Valley.

These species are threatened by one or more of the following factors: grazing, habitat destruction and fragmentation
from agricultural and urban development, alteration of wetlands, recreational activities, collection by lepidopterists
and other human disturbances, stochastic events, exotic plants, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

On August 4, 1994, the Service published three rules in the 

Federal Register

 that proposed the Laguna Mountains skipper and Quino checkerspot as endangered (59 FR 39868), the San Diego fairy
shrimp as endangered (59 FR 39874), and 

Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

 as endangered and 

Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 as threatened (59 FR 39879). In response to a formal request from William Hazeltine, environmental consultant, Oroville,
California, the Service has scheduled a public hearing on Wednesday, October 19, 1994 at the Radisson Hotel, 11520
West Bernardo Court, Rancho Bernardo (North County San Diego), California.

Those parties wishing to make a statement for the record should bring a copy of their statement to present to the Service
at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited in length, if the number of parties present at the hearing
necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials presented
at the hearing or mailed to the Service. Written comments will be given the same weight as oral comments. Written comments
may be submitted at the hearing or mailed to the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. The comment period closes on October 31, 1994.

Export of American Ginseng Harvested in 1994-1996 Seasons 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international
trade in plant and animal species. Export of plants and animals listed in CITES Appendix II may occur only if the Scientific
Authority has advised the permit-issuing Management Authority that such export will not be detrimental to the survival
of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the plant or 
animal specimens to be exported were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Export of cultivated
specimens of plants listed in Appendix II may occur under certificates issued by the Management Authority if it is
satisfied that the plants to be exported were artificially propagated. 


This document announces proposed findings on export of American ginseng 

(Panax quinquefolius)

 from the 1994-1996 harvest seasons in 22 States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) reviews information
and data on the topics described in this proposed rule as a basis for determining whether to continue approval of export
from specified States for the 1994-96 harvest seasons or to initiate changes. For Iowa and Wisconsin, approval
is only for 1994. In addition, the State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng under a State program;
the State of Maine has submitted legislation which has been signed to set up a State program for the export of cultivated
ginseng and is working to finalize the details of the program and to apply for export approval; and the State of Michigan
has submitted draft legislation and is intending to complete its application to export cultivated ginseng under
a State program soon. The Service proposes to approve only exports of cultivated ginseng from those three States,
contingent on submission of adequate final State information. 
Monitoring State ginseng programs for 16 years has shown that the States from which ginseng export has been approved
are likely to continue to satisfy CITES requirements. To ensure that this is so, the Service plans to continue its monitoring
in accordance with the procedures described herein, which have been somewhat streamlined and clarified. This monitoring
includes analysis of program reports made available to the Service no later than May 31 each year from each State from
which ginseng export is approved. These annual reports document the most recent previous harvest and the current
status of the State's program for ginseng. 
The requirement that 

all

 ginseng be inspected and certified by State officials is being modified to require that 

all wild

 ginseng be inspected and certified by State officials. Cultivated ginseng may be certified by licensed or registered
dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting. This change is being considered since: (1) The origin of the
roots is declared as to whether the plant was cultivated or taken from the wild; and (2) the marked difference in appearance
and price between wild and cultivated ginseng make it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be sold as cultivated
ginseng.

Scientific Authority:

 Dr. Charles W. Dane, Chief, Office of Scientific Authority (MS-ARLSQ-725), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Washington, DC 20240; fax number 703-358-2276, telephone 703-358-1708.




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international
trade in CITES-listed species. Export of specimens of species listed in Appendix II of the treaty may only occur upon
approval of a Scientific Authority and a Management Authority of the country of export. In the United States, the Scientific
Authority and Management Authority responsibilities are assigned to the Secretary of the Interior and are carried
out by offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 



CITES provides for listing of whole plants and specifically designated parts and derivatives of Appendix II plants.
Since 1973, whole plants and roots of American ginseng 

(Panax quinquefolius) 

have been so listed. In 1985, for reasons unrelated to the trade in American ginseng, the CITES Parties (member countries)
revised listing practices and decided to regulate not only whole specimens of plants on Appendix II, but also all their
readily recognizable parts and derivatives, unless they were specifically excluded. As a consequence, the listing
for ginseng needed restatement, and the listing proposal adopted by the Parties (November 22, 1985, 50 FR 48212) continues
to regulate ginseng exports, including plants, whole roots, essentially intact roots, and root chunks and slices
[50 CFR 23.23(d)(3)]. 

The Service may issue findings yearly or for more than one year. It began making multiyear findings for the export of
American ginseng on a State-by-State basis with issuance of the Scientific Authority and Management Authority findings
to cover the 1982-84 harvest seasons. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service reported that it found that
the status of wild ginseng did not appear to vary greatly from one year to the next within any given State, and that the
existing information compiled was adequate to justify findings under CITES for 3 years. The initial multiyear rule
was followed by a second such rule for the 1985-87 harvest seasons (50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985; 50 FR 42027,
October 17, 1985), and subsequent rules for the 1988-90 seasons (53 FR 33815, September 1, 1988) and the 1991-93
seasons (56 FR 41806, August 23, 1991). 

The Service uses information compiled since 1977 to make the multiyear findings. This notice concerns the Service's
proposed findings to approve the export of American ginseng to be collected in certain States in the 1994-96
harvest seasons. The Service plans to continue to review current biological and harvest information concerning
ginseng and those State programs approved for exporting of their ginseng. The State information previously submitted
need not be resubmitted if it is incorporated by reference and its validity reaffirmed. The Service is retaining the
option to revise 3-year findings whenever warranted by information that shows the need for change. The procedures
herein have been somewhat streamlined and clarified, and the Service would welcome comments concerning further
simplification of these procedures. 



Scientific Authority Criteria 



The overall criteria used by the Scientific Authority in finding whether export will not be detrimental to the survival
of a species are generally as follows (summarized from a notice of July 11, 1977; 42 FR 35800): 

1. Whether such export has occurred in the past and has appreciably reduced numbers or distribution of the species;


2. Whether such export has or is expected to increase, remain constant, or decrease; and 

3. Whether the life-history parameters of the species and relevant structure and function in its ecosystems indicate
that the present or proposed levels of export, considered with the potential impacts of other factors, are expected
to appreciably reduce the numbers or distribution of the species, or cause signs of appreciable ecological stress
within the species and/or in other species within its ecosystems. 

For ginseng, the evaluation for nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, in accordance with these general criteria,
is based on the information and data submitted on the following topics by each affected State and from other appropriate
sources. Information previously submitted that remains valid need only be referenced. 

The following information and data for wild ginseng can be conveniently recorded by natural region(s) of the State
or by county, preferably on a State map, or in a table of the counties. Ginseng is to be considered wild if it occurs in
naturally perpetuated habitat where the species is naturally propagated or with only limited planting of seeds and
with no subsequent tending of plants or habitat before harvest. 

1. Historic distribution of ginseng, with indication of optimal habitat. 

2. Location and approximate acreage of statute-protected lands in the State on which wild ginseng occurs and where
collecting is prohibited. 

3. Present abundance of ginseng, using the indices of 0 = absent, 1 = rare, 2 = occasional, 3 = frequent. 

4. Density within the ginseng populations for each natural region (or county) where present, using the indices of
1 = sparse, 2 = moderate, 3 = dense. 

5. Harvest collecting intensity, using the indices of 0 = none, 1 = light, 2 = moderate, 3 = heavy. 

6. Preferably by natural regions of the State (or by county) rather than statewide, the average number of roots per
pound (dry weight) as purchased by dealers. 

7. Information on trends in wild ginseng populations for the State or, if possible, natural regions of the State, indicating
whether populations are apparently increasing, stable, decreasing, or being extirpated.

<PARENT> FR940926-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition for the wild ginseng, the following information and data can be provided in narrative form: 
 
1. Approximate number of ginseng collectors (diggers) in the State and whether the number appears to be increasing,
stable, or decreasing. 

2. A description (or copy) of the State's regulations for the annual harvest of wild ginseng, including (a) designated
harvest season_preferably to begin after seeds are mature; and (b) harvest requirements, such as (i) minimum size
or age of plants allowed to be collected_at least 3-leaf (3-prong) is recommended, and (ii) whether seeds from collected
plants are to be planted and only at the harvest sites, etc. 

3. Number of pounds (dry weight) of ginseng roots certified by the State for export. 

4. Information on trends in roots per pound (dry weight) for the State or, if possible, natural regions of the State,
indicating whether the number of roots per pound appears to be increasing, stable, or decreasing. 

5. A brief description of any research projects related to ginseng's status that the State has initiated or that are
ongoing in the State. 

6. The State's opinion, based on the information and data provided on the topics above and any other information and
data that the State may provide, as to whether the removal of the ginseng from the wild in the State might have been adverse
for the State's entire population of the species.

 For cultivated ginseng, the following information and data can be provided in map, tabular, or narrative form. Ginseng
is considered cultivated when it is artificially propagated and maintained under controlled conditions, for example
in intensively or intermittently prepared or managed gardens or patches under artificial or natural shade. 

1. Counties in which ginseng is commercially cultivated. 

2. The number of pounds (dry weight) of cultivated ginseng roots certified by the State for export. 



Management Authority Criteria 



In addition to the Scientific Authority finding that ginseng exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the
species, the Management Authority must be satisfied (1) that the ginseng was not obtained in contravention of laws
for its protection, and (2) as to whether it was of wild or cultivated origin. 

Criteria used by the Management Authority in determining a State program's qualifications for export are that the
State has adopted and is implementing the following regulatory measures (see 50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985): 

1. A State ginseng law and regulations mandating State licensing or registration of persons purchasing or selling
ginseng collected or grown in that State. 

2. State requirements that these licensed or registered ginseng dealers maintain true and complete records of their
commerce in the annually harvested ginseng and provide copies of such records to the State in a signed and dated statement
at least every 90 days (within 15 days of end of each quarter of calendar year) and a year-end accounting of the total
commerce for the year. 

3. Dealer records required to show date of transaction, whether roots and plants were wild or cultivated, if roots
were dried or fresh (green) at time of transaction, weight of roots, weight or number of plants, State of origin of roots
or plants, and identification numbers of the State certificates used to ship ginseng from the State of origin. The
name and address of the seller or buyer of record of the ginseng shall be maintained by the dealer on his/her own copy
of commerce record forms supplied by the State(s) of licensing and shall be made available to the State ginseng-program
manager(s) upon request. 

4. Inspection and certification by State personnel of all wild ginseng harvested in the State to authenticate that
ginseng was legally obtained from wild sources within the State. Cultivated ginseng harvested in the State may be
certified by licensed or registered dealers approved by the State to make such an accounting of this ginseng. 

Experience has shown the value of an inspection and certification program by State official(s) who can document both
the weight of the ginseng roots (weight or number of plants) involved and that they were legally taken from the wild
or cultivated in that State. Dealer certification for cultivated ginseng is being considered because the declared
origin of the root is indicative of whether it is wild or cultivated and the marked difference in appearance and price
between wild and cultivated ginseng makes it reasonably unlikely that wild ginseng would be certified by a State-approved
dealer as cultivated. Cultivated ginseng may be recorded by such a dealer and exported with appropriate CITES export
documents without further certification by State officials. 

5. Ginseng unsold by March 31 of the year after harvest must be weighed by the State, and the dealer, digger, or root owner
given a State weight receipt. Future State export certification of this stock for export is to be issued against the
State weight receipt. 

6. Certificate of origin forms for wild ginseng must remain in State control until issued at certification. The certificate
of origin forms for all ginseng must contain the following information:




(a) State of origin; 
(b) Serial number of certificate; 
(c) Dealer's State registration number; 
(d) Dealer's shipment number for that harvest season; 
(e) Year of harvest of ginseng being certified; 
(f) Designation as wild or cultivated roots or plants; 
(g) Designation as dried or fresh (green) roots, or live plants; 
(h) Weight of roots or plants (or number of plants) separately expressed both numerically and in writing;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940926-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940926-1-00009 </PARENT>

(i) Verified statement by State ginseng official that the ginseng was obtained in that State in accordance with the
State law of that harvest year; 
(j) Name and title of State certifying official; 
(k) Date of certification; 
(l) Signatures of both the dealer and the State official making certification.

 

This certificate should be issued in triplicate, with the original designated for the dealer's use in commerce, first
copy for dealer records, and second copy retained by the State for reference. 
7. State regulations that (a) prohibit export from the State of its ginseng without certification by the State of origin,
and (b) require uncertified ginseng supplied to State-registered dealers to be returned to the State of origin within
30 calendar days for certification. Failure to have such ginseng certified will render those roots illegal for commerce
under State law. 
Each State from which ginseng export is approved shall, without further notice, make program information on each
year's harvest available to the Service's Office of Management Authority no later than May 31 of the subsequent year
(

e.g.,

 the State's 1994 ginseng data should be received by May 31, 1995). These data should be sufficient to satisfy the Scientific
Authority criteria indicated above. The following information is needed to satisfy the Management Authority criteria:

Program for Cultivated Ginseng 



On October 21, 1980 (45 FR 68944), the Service announced that it would approve export of cultivated ginseng only from
States for which the export of wild-collected ginseng was approved because those States had programs that could adequately
document the source of the ginseng. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service announced that it would approve export
of cultivated ginseng from other States if procedures had been implemented to minimize the risk that wild-collected
plants would be claimed as cultivated. The Service continues to consider granting such approval. 

The State of North Dakota has applied to export cultivated ginseng, and the Service is proposing to approve such exports
from this State. North Dakota is considered outside the native range of ginseng. The State of Michigan (which is within
the native range of the species) was granted interim approval to export cultivated ginseng from the 1993 harvest.
The State has been working with the Service to finalize procedures under a new State law and is planning on completing
their submission requesting approval of their ginseng program prior to the publication of the final rule. The Service
is considering the approval of such exports from this State. The Service's proposal to approve Michigan's program
is dependent upon receiving the required information. The State of Maine (which is within the native range of the species)
has passed legislation setting up a State program for cultivated ginseng and is working to complete their submission
for export approval for cultivated ginseng only. The Service is considering the approval of such exports pending
satisfactory completion of the application for export approval. 



Previous Export Approval 



On August 23, 1991 (56 FR 41806), the Service approved multiyear export of 1991-93 harvested ginseng only from
States with a legally regulated ginseng program that provided for a State certification and inspection system and
that satisfied the other criteria of the Management Authority and the Scientific Authority. The export of wild and
cultivated ginseng harvested from 1991 through 1993 was approved only from the 19 States indicated in the Code of Federal
Regulations [50 CFR 23.51(e)(1)]_see the 1991-1993 column in the table at the end of this document. Documents
containing information that provided the basis for the Service's findings of legal take and origin are on file at the
Office of Management Authority at the address given above. 

Such export approval means that any ginseng legally harvested during those years from Service-approved State programs
may be exported at any time when accompanied by appropriate State certification and valid Federal export documents
granted by the U.S. Management Authority. For example, ginseng legally harvested in 1992 under a Service-approved
State program may be exported in 1994 when accompanied by the 1992 State certificate of origin, a 1994 export document
issued by the Management Authority, and an exporter's invoice. 



Multiyear Findings 



As a result of monitoring State ginseng programs and the status of ginseng since 1977, the Service expects that States
from which the export of ginseng has been approved will continue to satisfy CITES requirements and that continued
export of ginseng from these States will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Therefore, States previously
approved for export of ginseng for the 1991-93 harvest seasons need not submit completely new applications
for export program approval for the 1994-96 harvest seasons. However, in relation to both the set of criteria
used by the Scientific Authority and the set used by the Management Authority, each State needs to reaffirm the validity
of its existing program and to notify the Service of any modifications or changes. 

This report with information on the 1993 harvest, reaffirmation of the ongoing State program, and any new program
information should have been received by May 31, 1994, from all States from which ginseng export has been approved
for the 1991-93 harvest years (see 56 FR 41806; August 23, 1991). The States of Iowa and Wisconsin have been notified
of the Service's concerns over the lack of State certification for wild ginseng. Therefore, the Service is proposing
to approve export of wild and cultivated ginseng from these two States for 1 year only. Findings allowing further export
will be made based on compliance with Service requirements. The Service is proposing to find that the status of the
species and State programs is such that the 1994-96 harvests of ginseng for export will not be detrimental to
the survival of the species for 17 of the 19 States approved for the 1991-93 harvest seasons. In addition, the
Service is proposing the approval of exports of cultivated ginseng from Maine and Michigan, pending receipt of required
information, and from North Dakota, which is outside the species' native range. 

Any States wishing to initiate export programs for ginseng should begin working with the Service early so that their
finalized request for approval can be submitted by March 31 of the year in which the State anticipates certifying that
season's ginseng for export. 

Service export approval is subject to revision prior to the 1995 and 1996 harvest seasons if a review of information
reveals that Management Authority or Scientific Authority findings on any approved State may need to be changed.
The Service proposes not to grant general approval for export of ginseng originating in any State not named in the 1994
codification of 50 CFR 23.51(e), for one or more of the following reasons: (1) The species does not occur there; (2)
no harvest of the species is allowed by the State; or (3) the Service does not have current information needed for Management
Authority and/or Scientific Authority findings. 

To ensure that States for which ginseng export is approved by the Service maintain successful programs so that export
is not detrimental to the survival of this species, the Service plans to annually review the export documents returned
from U.S. Department of Agriculture ports and the information and data submitted by the States, including any unexplained
changes in harvest levels and any other concerns presented in the State-submitted reports. Taking into account the
State evaluations, the Service will continue to make an overall evaluation on the status of ginseng. Notices will
be published in the 

Federal Register

 in 1995 and 1996 only if new information or changed conditions show reason for revised findings or guidelines. 



Export Procedures 



Valid Federal CITES documents are necessary to export wild or cultivated ginseng roots, major root parts, or plants.
Applications for these documents should be sent to the Office of Management Authority at the address given above.


Ginseng may only be exported through ports with personnel and/or facilities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA ports) that have been designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior (49 FR 49238, October 25, 1984; see 50
CFR 24.12). For each export, the exporter must present to the port inspector of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine (APHIS/PPQ), the following: 

1. Ginseng roots or plants being exported. 

2. Original State certificates of origin for the ginseng (or foreign export documents for American ginseng imported
into the United States). An exporter or dealer may split an original State certificate by striking a line through the
original weight on the certificate and stating in numbers and words the new lower weight of ginseng to be exported.
This change in weight must be certified by the dealer or exporter with the written words ``I made these changes on (date)''
followed by the full legal signature of the dealer or exporter. The modified State certificate of origin must bear
this certified change in ink, in original form, and be readily legible or also given in printed style. 

3. One completed Federal CITES export document (permit or certificate) with two copies. 

4. One copy of the exporter's executed invoice. 

The APHIS/PPQ port inspector may sign and validate the CITES documents only after a satisfactory inspection of the
contents of the State certificate(s) of origin, the exporter's invoice, CITES export documentation, and the shipment.
Once the CITES documents are validated, the inspector will forward the State certificates, one copy of the CITES export
document, and the exporter's invoice to the Office of Management Authority for recordkeeping and reporting. The
second copy of the Federal CITES export document goes to the exporter. The original CITES export document authorizes
the international shipment of the ginseng and will be collected by the importing country for its recordkeeping and
reporting.

Request for Information and Comments 



The Service requests information and comments on (1) the status of ginseng throughout its range or in any portion of
its range; (2) the proposed findings that the export of ginseng from any of the 22 States with programs to be approved
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species; and (3) the status criteria used. Information and comments
also are requested on the criteria and procedures and their implementation for determining (1) that exported specimens
are accurately declared as wild or cultivated; (2) that the ginseng (roots) originated in a particular State; and
(3) that the ginseng is not collected in contravention of laws for its protection. 

The Service also requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings
for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated
below. This proposed rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531


et seq.

; 87 Stat. 884, as amended), and was prepared by Mark R. Albert and Carol L. Carson, Office of Management Authority,
and Charles W. Dane, Bruce MacBryde, and Wayne L. Milstead, Office of Scientific Authority. 



Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations 



The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), and therefore
the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 

This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1994-96
harvest seasons, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule will not have significant
economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

). Exporters normally derive their product from ginseng roots harvested in a number of States. Therefore, the approval
or disapproval of wild ginseng export from any one State would not significantly affect the industry. Moreover, because
the proposed rule would treat exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance with
State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow
continued international trade in ginseng from the United States in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain
any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. 

It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require
approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes regulations to delay the opening of the first (roe) directed fishing season for the offshore component
pollock fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area from January 1 to January 26 of each fishing
year. This action is necessary to achieve optimum roe quality and increase revenues from the BSAI pollock processed
by the offshore component during the roe season. The proposed action also would prohibit vessels used to fish for BSAI
or Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore
component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery
would not apply to vessels used to participate in the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program prior to January 26
and is necessary to discourage participants in the offshore component pollock fishery from contributing to increased
fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season. This action is intended
to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the
BSAI.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) according to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and is implemented by regulations
governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 
Current regulations authorize all BSAI trawl fisheries, including the pollock fisheries, to start on January 20
of each year. Existing regulations at  675.20(a)(2)(ii) also authorize the establishment of separate pollock
total allowable catch (TAC) amounts for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas and the Bogoslof District. 
Through 1995, the pollock TACs specified for each subarea and district initially are allocated among the Western
Alaska CDQ reserve (7.5 percent), the BSAI operational reserve (7.5 percent), and the open access fisheries (85 percent,
of which 35 percent is allocated to the inshore component and 65 percent to the offshore component). The portion of
the TACs allocated to the inshore and offshore components is further apportioned into two seasonal allowances. The
first allowance (roe season) is available for directed fishing from January 1, until April 15, and the second allowance
(non-roe season) is available for directed fishing from August 15, until December 31. 
The Bering Sea pollock fishery has experienced increased harvesting and processing capacity and increased effort
in recent years under the existing open access management regime. While the TAC annually specified for pollock in
the last few years has remained fairly stable between 1.2 and 1.3 million metric tons, the increase in harvesting and
processing capacity has led to increasing daily catch rates and reduced season lengths for both the inshore and offshore
components. 
Three major factors affect the length of the pollock roe season: Annual TAC, the amount of pollock TAC apportioned
to the pollock roe season, and amount of fishing effort. Regulations authorizing the seasonal apportionment of pollock
TACs have been effective since 1991. In 1991 and 1992, 40 percent of the Bering Sea pollock initial TAC was apportioned
to the roe season, and 45 percent was apportioned in 1993 and 1994. Since 1991, the length of the Bering Sea pollock roe
season has decreased each year. The roe season pollock quota was harvested in 52 days in 1991 and 46 days in 1992. Effective
June 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995, pollock TACs are apportioned among the offshore component, inshore component,
and CDQ pollock fisheries. The 1993 roe season allowance apportioned to the offshore component was harvested in 33
days. The inshore component roe fishery lasted 63 days from January 20, through March 24. However, a strike by vessels
delivering onshore delayed fishing until the first week of February. The inshore component's roe season pollock
apportionment was harvested in about 48 days. In 1994, the offshore component roe season closed on February 18 (29
days), and the inshore component roe season closed on March 2 (41 days).

Pollock roe produced from the roe season harvests represents a substantial portion of the gross wholesale value of
the pollock fishery and roe maturity is one of the most important factors in determining product value. Good quality
mature roe receives the highest price, followed by immature and over-mature roe. Therefore, in order to maximize
the value of roe production, industry prefers to harvest as much roe as possible during the period of peak roe maturity
and to minimize the harvest of immature and over-mature roe. Although the timing of peak roe maturity varies depending
on the age of the fish, the location where fish spawn, and ocean conditions, industry sources report that the period
of peak roe maturity usually occurs between February 10 and February 20. 
The pollock roe season length has shortened to the degree that some offshore processors participating in the open
access fishery believe that the fishery closes before or during the timing of peak roe maturity. Consequently, the
value of the pollock harvest is significantly lower than it could be if the season were delayed. This trend likely will
continue under the open access management system. 
Concerns about a shortened roe season do not appear to be shared by participants in the inshore component pollock fishery
or some of the offshore processors who also participate in the CDQ pollock fisheries, which occur after the close of
the open access fishery. Inshore processors report that peak roe maturity generally occurs during the first 2 weeks
of February and, because the 1994 roe season extended into early March, the fishery fully encompassed the period of
peak roe maturity. Delay of the inshore component roe season would likely increase the harvest of pollock with lower
valued, over-mature roe. 
At the request of offshore component processors, the Council first considered alternatives for delaying the pollock
roe season at its June 1993 meeting. Lack of industry consensus on a preferred alternative prevented the Council from
taking action. The continued shortening of the roe season in 1994 prompted the Council again to consider alternative
season opening dates for the pollock roe season. 
At its June 1994 meeting, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the public on alternative dates for the start
of the pollock roe season. For the reasons given below, the Council determined that delaying the offshore component
roe season opening date to January 26 would provide the most benefit to the fishing industry and recommended that NMFS
initiate rulemaking to delay the opening of the offshore component pollock roe season until this date. 
To discourage a shift in fishing effort into other fisheries by pollock vessels prior to January 26, the Council also
recommended that vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 be prohibited
from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This prohibition would not apply
to vessels participating in a CDQ fishery. 
Section 14.3 of the FMP requires that the Council consider the following criteria when recommending a regulatory
amendment to change season opening dates: Biological, bycatch, exvessel and wholesale prices, product quality,
safety, cost, other fisheries, coordinated season timing, enforcement and management costs, and allocation effects.
The EA/RIR/IRFA prepared for this action addresses anticipated effects of the proposed delay relative to these criteria.
The following discussion summarizes these effects relative to how the Council's objectives for an offshore component
roe season delay are met under the proposed action. 


Biological or bycatch effects. 

A delay of the roe season opening date for the offshore component pollock fishery to January 26 would affect neither
the amount of pollock harvested during the roe season nor the overall duration of the fishery. Although the proposed
action would result in a 6-day shift of trawl effort, significant spatial differences in trawl effort distribution
would not be expected because the location of spawning stocks of pollock likely would not vary significantly during
this 6-day period. Similarly, a 6-day delay in the opening date of the pollock roe season would not affect the size of
pollock taken in this fishery. When female pollock are entering a spawning condition, their energy is going into the
production of eggs and maintenance, and not into growth. 
In the BSAI, Pacific halibut, red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, and herring are prohibited species for which bycatch
limits are established and apportioned each year to the pollock and other groundfish trawl fisheries based on Council
recommendations. Pacific salmon also are prohibited species that may not be retained in the groundfish fisheries;
however, no salmon bycatch limits currently are established. Few data exist to suggest that the proposed change in
the pollock roe season would have any positive or negative impact on the prohibited species bycatch amounts. Observer
data indicate that an opening date later into the season could help to reduce chinook salmon bycatch in the trawl fisheries.
However, the effects of a change of less than 1 week for a start date are difficult to measure. 
The proposed action would not have an adverse effect on marine mammals or seabirds, because it would not increase pollock
harvests or significantly change the temporal or spatial distribution of this harvest. 


Product quality and value. 

The proposed delay of the offshore component pollock roe season is intended to increase the value of the pollock harvested
during the roe season by delaying the offshore component fishery so the season fully encompasses the period of optimum
roe maturity. This action likely would affect the roe product quality and value experienced in the CDQ pollock fisheries.

Participants in the CDQ pollock fisheries include the Western Alaska community groups that have been allocated pollock
quota and the processors with which they contract for the harvest and processing of the quota. In 1993 and 1994, the
roe season CDQ pollock fisheries occurred immediately after the close of the open access roe season, when the proportion
of mature roe produced was still quite high. Under the proposed action, CDQ harvests likely would occur between January
20 and January 26 and after the offshore component fishery closed. In either case, if the offshore component roe season
delay achieves the primary objective of allowing this fishery to be prosecuted when pollock roe maturity is optimum,
the overall gross wholesale value of the pollock CDQ fishery would be reduced. However, based on the volume of pollock
harvested and the number of participants in the fisheries, an increase in the value of roe production during the offshore
component fishery (due to increased roe quality) probably would be greater than the decrease in the value of roe production
in the CDQ fisheries.



Allocation, coordinated season timing, and impacts on other fisheries. 

The proposed action is intended to discourage vessels participating in the offshore component pollock fishery from
contributing to increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season
on January 26. Under the proposed action, vessels used to participate in a BSAI groundfish fishery, a GOA groundfish
fishery, or the BSAI king or Tanner crab fishery would be prevented from entering the offshore component pollock fishery
until February 5_10 days after the opening of the offshore component roe season. The intent of this action is to encourage
vessel owners to choose between fishing for pollock or for another species, thus minimizing any preemptive impacts
on other fisheries that may otherwise occur under the proposed delay of the pollock roe season.



Costs. 

Vessels used to participate in a BSAI or GOA groundfish fishery or the BSAI king or Tanner crab fisheries prior to January
26 would be prohibited from participating in the offshore pollock fishery before February 5. This limitation could
impose costs on those vessels that target on more than one species during the pollock roe season. These vessels would
be precluded from participating in other fisheries prior to the roe season if they also wanted to continue their pollock
target fisheries.

If approved by NMFS, the Council's recommended action to delay the offshore component pollock roe season would be
effective only through December 31, 1995, when regulations authorizing the allocation of pollock between the inshore
and offshore component expire. Continued effectiveness of the proposed delay would require new rulemaking contingent
on the implementation of a separate FMP amendment that would authorize inshore/offshore groundfish allocations
beyond 1995.



Classification



NMFS prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have significant
effects on a substantial number of small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions with limited resources). The Western Alaska community groups that have received CDQs in the pollock
fishery are considered small entities, because they are government jurisdictions with populations less than 50,000.
The proposed action would delay the start date of the offshore pollock roe season in the BSAI in order to increase the
wholesale value of roe production in the open access fishery. If this action is successful in its purpose, the value
of roe production in the CDQ pollock fisheries would probably decline, thereby reducing revenue to the Western Alaska
community groups. The reduction in revenue generated from the CDQ program could have a ``significant impact'' on
these small entities by reducing their annual gross revenues by more than 5 percent.

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes restrictions or prohibitions on 
substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Significant New Alternatives 
Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the amended 
Clean Air Act of 1990 which requires EPA to evaluate and regulate 
substitutes for the ODSs to reduce overall risk to human health and 
the environment. Through these evaluations, SNAP generates lists of 
acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major 
industrial use sectors. The intended effect of the SNAP program is 
to expedite movement away from ozone depleting compounds while 
avoiding a shift into high-risk substitutes posing other 
environmental problems. 



On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated a final rulemaking setting 
forth its plan for administering the SNAP program, and 
issued decisions on the acceptability and unacceptability of a number 
substitutes. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA is 
issuing its preliminary decisions on the acceptability of certain 
substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. To arrive at 
determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency 
completed a cross-media evaluation of risks to human health and the 
environment by sector end-use. 

Today's action proposes new additions to the list of controlled 
or prohibited substitutes. As described in the final rule for the 
SNAP program, EPA does believe that notice-and-comment 
rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of 
prohibited substitutes, to list an alternative as acceptable only 
under certain use conditions or certain narrow end-use applications. 

EPA does not, however, believe that rulemaking procedures are 
required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. 
Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any 
prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding 
substitutes to the list of acceptable alternatives without first 
requesting comment on new listings. Updates to the acceptable lists 
are published as separate notices in the 

Federal Register

. A 
comprehensive compilation of all listings will be published annually.

II. Section 612 Program 


A. Statutory Requirements 


Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to develop a 
program for evaluating alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. 
EPA is referring to this program as the Significant New Alternatives 
Policy (SNAP) program. The major provisions of section 612 are: 



Rulemaking_

Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules 
making it unlawful to replace any class I 
(chlorofluorocarbon, halon, carbon tetrachloride, methyl 
chloroform, methyl bromide, and hydrobromofluorocarbon) or 
class II (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) substance with any 
substitute that the Administrator determines may present 
adverse effects to human health or the environment where 
the Administrator has identified an alternative that: (1) 
Reduces the overall risk to human health and the 
environment; and (2) is currently or potentially available. 


Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes_

Section 
612(c) also requires EPA to publish a list of the 
substitutes unacceptable for specific uses. EPA must 
publish a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for 
specific uses. 


Petition Process_

Section 612(d) grants the right to any 
person to petition EPA to add a substitute to or delete a 
substitute from the lists published in accordance with 
section 612(c). The Agency has 90 days to grant or deny a 
petition. Where the Agency grants the petition, EPA must 
publish the revised lists within an additional 6 months. 


90-day Notification_

Section 612(e) requires EPA to require 
any person who produces a chemical substitute for a class I 
substance to notify the Agency not less than 90 days before 
new or existing chemicals are introduced into interstate 
commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a 
class I substance. The producer must also provide the 
Agency with the producer's unpublished health and safety 
studies on such substitutes. 


Outreach_

Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator 
shall seek to maximize the use of federal research 
facilities and resources to assist users of class I and II 
substances in identifying and developing alternatives to 
the use of such substances in key commercial applications. 


Clearinghouse_

Section 612(b)(4) requires the Agency to set 
up a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product 
substitutes, and alternative manufacturing processes that 
are available for products and manufacturing processes 
which use class I and II substances. 



B. Regulatory History 


On March 18, 1994, EPA published the Final Rulemaking (FRM) (59 
FR 13044) which described the process for administering the SNAP 
program and issued EPA's first acceptability lists for substitutes in 
the major industrial use sectors. These sectors include: 
refrigeration and air conditioning; foam blowing; solvent cleaning; 
fire suppression and explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; 
adhesives, coatings and inks; and tobacco expansion. These sectors 
comprise the principal industrial sectors that historically consume 
large volumes of ozone-depleting compounds. 

The Agency defines a ``substitute'' as any chemical, product, 
substitute, or alternative manufacturing process, whether existing or 
new, that could replace a class I or class II substance. Anyone who 
produces a substitute must provide the Agency with health and safety 
studies on the substitute at least 90 days before introducing it into 
interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative. This 
requirement applies to chemical manufacturers, but may include 
importers, formulators or end-users when they are responsible for 
introducing a substitute into commerce. 



III. Proposed Listing of Substitutes 


To develop the lists of unacceptable and acceptable substitutes, 
EPA conducts screens of health and environmental risks posed by 
various substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds in each use sector. 
The outcome of these risks screens can be found in the public docket, 
as described above in the 

ADDRESSES

 portion of this notice. 
Under section 612, the Agency has considerable discretion in the 
risk management decisions it can make in SNAP. The Agency has 
identified five possible decision categories: acceptable, acceptable 
subject to use conditions; acceptable subject to narrowed use limits; 
unacceptable; and pending. Acceptable substitutes can be used with 
no limits for all applications within the relevant sector end-use. 
Conversely, it is illegal to replace an ODS with a substitute listed 
by SNAP as unacceptable. A pending listing represents substitutes 
for which the Agency has not received complete data or has not 
completed its review of the data. 

After reviewing a substitute, the Agency may make a 
determination that a substitute is acceptable only if conditions of 
use are met to minimize risks to human health and the environment. 
Use of such substitutes in ways that are inconsistent with such use 
conditions renders these substitutes unacceptable. 

Even though the Agency can restrict the use of a substitute 
based on the potential for adverse effects, it may be necessary to 
permit a narrowed range of use within a sector end-use because of the 
lack of alternatives for specialized applications. Users intending 
to adopt a substitute acceptable with narrowed use limits must 
ascertain that other acceptable alternatives are not technically 
feasible. Companies must document the results of their evaluation, 
and retain the results on file for the purpose of demonstrating 
compliance. This documentation shall include descriptions of 
substitutes examined and rejected, processes or products in which the 
substitute is needed, reason for rejection of other alternatives, 
e.g., performance, technical or safety standards, and the anticipated 
date other substitutes will be available and projected time for 
switching to other available substitutes. Use of such substitutes in 
application and end-uses which are not specified as acceptable in the 
narrowed use limit renders these substitutes unacceptable. 

In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), EPA is issuing its 
preliminary decision on the acceptability of certain substitutes not 
previously reviewed by the Agency. As described in the final rule 
for the SNAP program (59 FR 13044), EPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative
on the list 
of prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only 
under certain use conditions or narrowed use limits, or to remove an 
alternative from either the list of prohibited or acceptable 
substitutes. 

EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to 
list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings 
do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any prior license to 
use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substitutes to the 
list of acceptable alternatives without first requesting comment on 
new listings. Updates to the acceptable and pending lists are 
published as separate notices in the 

Federal Register

. 

Parts A. through E. below present a detailed discussion of the 
substitute listing determinations by major use sector. Tables 
summarizing listing decisions in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide 
additional information on a substitute. Since comments are not part 
of the regulatory decision, they are not mandatory for use of a 
substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with 
respect to other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the 
substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes 
to apply all comments in their use of these substitutes. In many 
instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating practices 
that have already been identified in existing industry and/or 
building-code standards. Thus, many of the comments, if adopted, 
would not require significant changes in existing operating practices 
for the affected industry. 



A. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 


1. Overview 


The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses 
of class I and class II substances to produce cooling, including 
mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and 
heat transfer. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for 
a more detailed description of this sector. 

The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into 
the following end-uses: 

 commercial comfort air conditioning;

 industrial process refrigeration system;

 industrial process air conditioning;

 ice skating rinks;

 uranium isotope separation processing;

 cold storage warehouses;

<PARENT> FR940926-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 refrigerated transport; 
 retail food refrigeration; 
 vending machines; 
 water coolers; 
 commercial ice machines; 
 household refrigerators; 
 household freezers; 
 residential dehumidifiers; 
 motor vehicle air conditioning; 
 residential air conditioning and heat pumps; 
 non-mechanical heat transfer; and 
 very low temperature refrigeration. 

In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed
substitutes in every 
end-use for this NPRM. 

EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this 
SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat transfer 
end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to 
avoid confusion between systems that move heat from a cool area to a 
warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the 
movement of heat away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). 
The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low 
temperature refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been 
reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added for this 
SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC-13, 
R-13B1, and R-503 industrial process refrigeration. Please refer to 
the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other than these three. EPA may continue to
add other end-uses 
in future SNAP updates. 



a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer.

 As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source
to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat 
from a cool area to a warm one. Generally, there are two types of 
systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating 
coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, known as 
thermosyphons. 



b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration.

 Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances 
require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles. These systems must 
meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to 
refrigeration systems. They usually have very small charges. 
Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because 
performance is critically affected by any charge loss, standard 
maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level 
considerably below that for other types of refrigeration and air 
conditioning equipment. 



c. CFC-13, R-13B1, and R-503 Industrial Process Refrigeration.

 This end-use differs from other types of industrial 
refrigeration only in the extremely low temperature regimes that are 
required. Although some substitutes may work in both these extremely 
low temperatures and in systems designed to use R-502, they are 
acceptable only for this end-use because of global warming and 
atmospheric lifetime concerns. These concerns are discussed more 
fully below. 



2. Substitutes for Refrigerants 



Substitutes fall into eight broad categories. Seven of these 
categories are chemical substitutes used in the same vapor 
compression cycle as the ozone-depleting substances being replaced. 
They include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), hydrocarbons, refrigerant blends, ammonia, perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs), and chlorine systems. The eighth category includes 
alternative technologies that generally do not rely on vapor 
compression cycles. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 

FR

 
13044) for more discussion of these broad categories. 



a. Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions. 

(1) CFC-12 Automobile and Non-automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit and New. EPA is concerned
that the existence of several substitutes in 
this end-use may increase the likelihood of significant refrigerant 
cross-contamination and potential failure of both air conditioning 
systems and recovery/recycling equipment. In addition, a smooth 
transition to the use of substitutes strongly depends on the 
continued purity of the recycled CFC-12 supply. In order to prevent 
cross-contamination and preserve the purity of recycled refrigerants, 
EPA is proposing several conditions on the use of all motor vehicle 
air conditioning refrigerants. For the purposes of this rule, no 
distinction is made between ``retrofit'' and ``drop-in'' refrigerants; 
retrofitting a car to use a new refrigerant includes all procedures 
that result in the air conditioning system using a new refrigerant. 

In particular, when retrofitting a CFC-12 system to use any 
substitute refrigerant, the following conditions must be met: 

 Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings 
that is unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male 
or female, as appropriate) must be used with all containers 
of the refrigerant, on can taps, on recovery, recycling, 
and charging equipment, and on all air conditioning system 
service ports. These fittings must be designed to 
mechanically prevent cross-charging with another 
refrigerant. A refrigerant may only be used with the 
fittings and can taps specifically intended for that 
refrigerant. Using an adapter or deliberately modifying a 
fitting to use a different refrigerant will be a violation 
of this use condition. In addition, fittings shall meet 
the following criteria, derived from Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE) standards and recommended practices: 




_When existing CFC-12 service ports are to be 
retrofitted, conversion assemblies shall attach to the 
CFC-12 fitting with a thread lock adhesive and/or a 
separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner 
that permanently prevents the assembly from being 
removed. 

_All conversion assemblies and new service ports must 
satisfy the vibration testing requirements of sections 
3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of SAE J1660, as applicable, excluding 
references to SAE J639 and SAE J2064, which are 
specific to HFC-134a. 

_In order to prevent discharge of refrigerant to the 
atmosphere, systems shall have a device to limit 
compressor operation before the pressure relief device 
will vent refrigerant. This requirement is waived for 
systems that do not feature such a pressure relief 
device. 

_All CFC-12 service ports shall be retrofitted with 
conversion assemblies or shall be rendered permanently 
incompatible for use with CFC-12 related service 
equipment by fitting with a device attached with a 
thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical 
latching mechanism in a manner that prevents the 
device from being removed. 



 When a retrofit is performed, a label must be used as 
follows: 




_The person conducting the retrofit must apply a label 
to the air conditioning system in the engine 
compartment that contains the following information: 




*_the name and address of the technician and the company performing the retrofit 

*_the date of the retrofit 

*_the trade name, charge amount, and, when applicable, the ASHRAE refrigerant numerical designation of the refrigerant


*_the type, manufacturer, and amount of lubricant used 

*_if the refrigerant is or contains an ozone-depleting substance, the statement ``This refrigerant contains an
ozone-depleting substance and it is therefore subject to the venting prohibition, recycling, and other provisions
of regulations issued under section 609 of the Clean Air Act.'' 

*_if the refrigerant is not or does not contain any ozone-depleting substances, the statement ``This refrigerant
does not deplete stratospheric ozone, and as of November 15, 1995, at the latest, it is subject to the venting prohibition,
recycling, and other provisions of regulations issued under section 609 of the Clean Air Act.'' 

*_if the refrigerant displays flammability limits as measured according to ASTM E681, the statement ``This refrigerant
is FLAMMABLE. Take appropriate 
precautions.''

<TEXT>
 

_This label must be large enough to be easily read and 
must be permanent. 
_The background color must be unique to the 
refrigerant. 
_The label must be affixed to the system over 
information related to the previous refrigerant, in a 
location not normally replaced during vehicle repair. 
_Information on the previous refrigerant that cannot be 
covered by the new label must be permanently rendered 
unreadable. 




 No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system 
that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant 
must be recovered in accordance with regulations issued 
under section 609 of the CAA prior to charging with a 
substitute. 

Since these use conditions necessitate unique fittings and 
labels, it will be necessary for developers of automotive 
refrigerants to consult with EPA about the existence of other 
alternatives. Such discussions will lower the risk of duplicating 
fittings already in use. 

No determination guarantees satisfactory performance from a 
refrigerant. Consult the original equipment manufacturer or service 
personnel for further information on using a refrigerant in a 
particular system. 

(a) HFC-134a. 

HFC-134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted 
and new motor vehicle air conditioners, subject to the use conditions 
applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning described above.

 
HFC-134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC-134a's GWP and 
atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which 
have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, 
HFC-134a's contribution to global warming could be significant in 
leaky end-uses such as motor vehicle air conditioning systems 
(MVACS). EPA has determined that the use of HFC-134a in these 
applications is acceptable because industry continues to develop 
technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available 
substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC-134a is not 
flammable and its toxicity is low. While HFC-134a is compatible with 
most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it 
is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such 
systems. An appropriate ester-based, polyalkylene glycol-based, or 
other type of lubricant should be used. Consult the original 
equipment manufacturer or the retrofit kit manufacturer for further 
information. 

(b) R-401C. 

R-401C, which consists of HCFC-22, HFC-152a, and HCFC-124, is 
acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted and new motor 
vehicle air conditioners, subject to the use conditions applicable to 
motor vehicle air conditioning described above.

 HCFC-22 and HCFC-124 
contribute to ozone depletion, but to a much lesser degree than CFC-12. The production of HCFC-22 will
be phased out according to the 
accelerated phaseout schedule (published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). The 
GWP of HCFC-22 is somewhat higher than other alternatives for this 
end-use. Experimental data indicate that HCFC-22 may leak through 
flexible hosing in mobile air conditioners at a high rate. In order 
to preserve the blend's composition and to reduce its contribution to 
global warming, EPA strongly recommends using barrier hoses when hose 
assemblies need to be replaced during a retrofit procedure. The GWPs 
of the other components are low. Although this blend does contain 
one flammable constituent, the blend itself is not flammable. Leak 
testing demonstrated that the blend never becomes flammable. 

(c) HCFC Blend Beta. 

HCFC Blend Beta is acceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in retrofitted and new motor vehicle air conditioners,
subject to the 
use conditions applicable to motor vehicle air conditioning described 
above.

 The composition of this blend has been claimed confidential 
by the manufacturer. This blend contains at least one HCFC, and 
therefore contributes to ozone depletion, but to a much lesser degree 
than CFC-12. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued 
under section 609 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. Its 
production will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule 
(published 12/10/93, 58 FR 65018). The GWPs of the components are 
moderate to low. This blend is nonflammable, and leak testing has 
demonstrated that the blend never becomes flammable. 



b. Acceptable Subject to Narrowed Use Limits.

 (1) Non-mechanical Heat Transfer, New and Retrofit.

(a) Perfluorocarbons. 

Perfluorocarbons are proposed acceptable as substitutes for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114,
and CFC-115 in new and retrofitted thermosyphons and recirculating coolers only where no other 
alternatives are technically feasible due to safety or performance 
requirements.

toxicity and nonflammable. The principal characteristic of concern 
for PFCs is that they have long atmospheric lifetimes and have the 
potential to contribute to global climate change. For instance, 
C

5

F

12

 has a lifetime of 4,100 years and a 100-year GWP of 5,600. PFCs are also included in the Climate Change Action Plan which

broadly instructs EPA to use section 612 of the CAA, as well as 
voluntary programs, to control emissions. Despite these concerns, 
EPA is proposing to list PFCs as acceptable in certain small 
applications because they may be the only substitutes that can 
satisfy safety or performance requirements. For example, a 
transformer may require very high dielectric strength, or a heat 
transfer system for a chlorine manufacturing process could require 
compatibility with the process stream. 

Users should note, however, that use of a PFC should be a last 
resort. As the proposed determination states, PFCs should be used 
``only where no other alternatives are technically feasible due to 
safety or performance requirements.'' This statement requires users 
to conduct a thorough search for other substitutes. Although EPA 
does not require users to submit information on such a search, 
companies must keep the results on file for future reference. 

In cases where users must adopt PFCs, they should make every effort to: 

 Recover and recycle these fluids during servicing 

 Adopt maintenance practices that reduce leakage as much as 
is technically feasible 

 Recover these fluids after the end of the equipment's 
useful life and either recycle them or destroy them 

 Continue to search for other long-term alternatives 

Users of PFCs should note that if other alternatives become 
available, EPA could be petitioned to list PFCs as unacceptable due 
to the availability of other suitable substitutes. If such a 
petition were granted, EPA may grandfather existing uses but only 
upon consideration of cost and timing of testing and implementation 
of new substitutes. In addition, while this listing allows for use 
of PFCs in some new systems, a petition indicating widespread design 
of systems using PFCs where other alternatives exist could adversely 
impact any grandfathering decisions. 

EPA believes these end-uses are covered under section 608 of the 
CAA and encourages voluntary compliance with the recycling and leak 
repair provisions of that rule until new rulemakings specifically 
address non-ozone-depleting refrigerants. 



c. Unacceptable Substitutes.



(1) R-403B

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940926-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940926-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

R-403B, which consists of HCFC-22, R-218, and propane, is proposed unacceptable as a substitute
for R-502 in the following new and retrofitted end-uses:
 industrial process refrigeration;
 cold storage warehouses;
 refrigerated transport;
 retail food refrigeration;
 commercial ice machines; and
 household freezers.
R-218, perfluoropropane, has an extremely high GWP and lifetime. Although this substitute may offer energy
efficiency gains, its lifetime and direct GWP pose additional risk beyond that of other substitutes for these end-uses.
In particular, the lifetime of R-218 is over 2000 years, which means that global warming and other effects would
be essentially irreversible. EPA believes that while other substitutes may have high GWPs, they do not exhibit such
long lifetimes.


(2) R-405A


R-405A, which is composed of HCFC-22, HFC-152a, HCFC-142b, and R-c318, is proposed
unacceptable as a substitute for CFC-12, R-500, and R-502 in the following new and retrofitted end-uses:
 commercial comfort air conditioning;
 industrial process refrigeration;
 ice skating rinks;
 cold storage warehouses;
 refrigerated transport;
 retail food refrigeration;
 vending machines;
 water coolers;
 commercial ice machines;
 household refrigerators;
 household freezers;
 residential dehumidifiers; and
 motor vehicle air conditioning.
R-405A was listed as HCFC/HFC/fluoroalkane Blend A in previous notices. R-405A contains a high proportion
of R-c318, cycloperfluorobutane, which has an extremely high GWP and lifetime. Although this substitute may
offer energy efficiency gains, its lifetime and direct GWP pose additional risk beyond that of other substitutes
for these end-uses. In particular, the lifetime of R-c318 is over 3000 years, which means that global warming
and other effects would be essentially irreversible. EPA believes that while other substitutes may have high GWPs,
they do not exhibit such long lifetimes.


(3) Hydrocarbon Blend B


Hydrocarbon Blend B is proposed unacceptable as a substitute for CFC-12 in the following new and retrofitted
end-uses:
 commercial comfort air conditioning;
 ice skating rinks;
 cold storage warehouses;
 refrigerated transport;
 retail food refrigeration;
 vending machines;
 water coolers;
 commercial ice machines;
 household refrigerators;
 household freezers;
 residential dehumidifiers; and
 motor vehicle air conditioning.
Flammability is the primary concern. EPA believes the use of this substitute in very leaky uses like motor vehicle
air conditioning may pose a high risk of fire. EPA requires a risk assessment be conducted to demonstrate this blend
may be safely used in any CFC-12 end-uses. The manufacturer of this blend has not submitted such a risk assessment,
and EPA therefore finds it unacceptable.


(4) Flammable Substitutes


Flammable substitutes, defined as having flammability limits as measured according to ASTM E-681 with modifications
included in Society of Automotive Engineers Recommended Practice J1657, including blends which become flammable
during fractionation, are proposed unacceptable as substitutes for CFC-12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air
conditioning systems.
Flammable refrigerants differ from traditional substances in several ways: potential gains in energy efficiency,
reductions in direct contribution to global warming, and additional risks from fire. Flammable refrigerants may
be good substitutes in systems designed with fire risks in mind. In addition, in certain circumstances, they may serve
well as substitutes in retrofit uses. EPA encourages research efforts into the use of flammable refrigerants, but
remains concerned about the dangers. Because of these concerns, EPA has established the requirement that manufacturers
of flammable refrigerants conduct detailed risk assessments in all end-uses. The risks from flammability are extremely
sensitive to the size of charge and end-use.

In MVACS, flammable refrigerants pose risks not found in stationary equipment, including the potential for collisions,
the placement of the condenser directly behind the grille, flexible hoses which could be punctured, the hazard to
technicians who are expecting to handle flammable fluids, the danger to passengers from evaporator leaks, and the
dangers to personnel involved in disposal of old automobiles. Due to the length of SNAP review, certain substitutes
have been marketed which EPA believes may pose substantial risk to users. The intent of the 90-day review process was
not to allow manufacturers to market risky substitutes, but rather to ensure a thorough review. Because of potential
risks to users and service personnel, EPA finds it necessary to find all flammable substitutes unacceptable in retrofitted
automotive air conditioning to prevent hazardous substitutes from being marketed prior to a thorough risk assessment.
EPA continues to encourage investigation of all substitute refrigerants, including flammable substances. This
unacceptable determination only applies to retrofitted MVACS. If a manufacturer wishes an acceptable determination
for a flammable substitute in MVACS, this risk assessment must be conducted in a scientifically valid manner. EPA
will consider such a risk assessment in any determination on the substitute.


B. Solvents


1. Acceptable Subject to Use Conditions


a. Electronics Cleaning. 

(1) HCFC-225 ca/cb. 

HCFC-225 is proposed acceptable subject to use conditions as a substitute for CFC-113 and MCF in electronics
cleaning. 

The HCFC-225 ca isomer has a company-set exposure limit of 25 ppm. The company set exposure limit of the HCFC-225
cb isomer is 250 ppm. These limits should be readily achievable since HCFC-225 is only sold commercially as a
(45%/50%) blend of -ca and -cb isomers. In addition, the vapor degreasing and cold cleaning equipment
where HCFC-225 is used, typically has very low emissions.


b. Precision Cleaning. 

(1) HCFC-225 ca/cb. 

HCFC-225 is proposed acceptable subject to use conditions as a substitute for CFC-113 and MCF in precision
cleaning. 

The HCFC-225 ca isomer has a company-set exposure limit of 25 ppm. The company set exposure limit of the HCFC-225
cb isomer is 250 ppm. These limits should be readily achievable since HCFC-225 is only sold commercially as a
(45%/50%) blend of -ca and -cb isomers. In addition, the vapor degreasing and cold cleaning equipment
where HCFC-225 is used, typically has very low emissions.

is proposed acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance
or safety requirements: (a) Due to their physical or chemical properties or (b) where human exposure to the agents
may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating
conditions. 

This proposed agent is subject to the same use conditions stipulated for all total flooding agents, that is:
 Where egress from an area cannot be accomplished within one minute, the employer shall not use this agent in
concentrations exceeding its NOAEL.
 Where egress takes longer than 30 seconds but less than one minute, the employer shall not use the agent in a concentration
greater than its LOAEL.
 Agent concentrations greater than the LOAEL are only permitted in areas not normally occupied by employees
provided that any employee in the area can escape within 30 seconds. The employer shall assure that no unprotected
employees enter the area during agent discharge.
Cup burner tests in heptane indicate that C

F

 can extinguish fires in a total flood application at concentrations of 7.30 per cent and therefore has a design concentration
of 8.8 per cent. The cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 30 per cent for this agent is well above its extinguishment concentration
and therefore is safe for use in occupied areas. This agent can replace Halon 1301 by a ratio of 2 to 1 by weight.

Using agents in high concentrations poses a risk of asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. With an ambient oxygen level
of 21 per cent, a design concentration of 22.6 per cent may reduce oxygen levels to approximately 16 per cent, the minimum
level considered to be required to prevent impaired judgement or other physiological effects. Thus, the oxygen level
resulting from discharge of this agent must be at least 16 per cent.

 has no ozone depletion potential, and is nonflammable, essentially non-toxic, and is not a VOC. However, this agent
has an atmospheric lifetime of 3,200 years and a 100-year GWP of 6100. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of C

F

, the Agency is finding this chemical acceptable only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically
feasible due to performance or safety requirements. In most total flooding applications, the Agency believes that
alternatives to C

 exist. EPA intends that users select C

F

8

 out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the requirements
of the specific end-use preclude use of other available alternatives. 

Users must observe the limitations on C

3

F

 acceptability by undertaking the following measures: (i) conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end
use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may approach or result in cardiosensitization
or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical
or chemical properties or other technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. 

EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions of this agent by limiting testing of C

 to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recovering C

F

 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroying or recycling C

 for later use. EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid
such unnecessary emissions. 

(2) CF

I. 

CF

3



I is proposed acceptable as a Halon 1301 substitute in normally unoccupied areas.

 Any employee that could possibly be in the area must be able to escape within 30 seconds. The employer shall assure that
no unprotected employees enter the area during agent discharge. 

CF

3

I (Halon 13001) is a fluoroiodocarbon with an atmospheric lifetime of only 1.15 days due to its rapid photolysis in
the presence of light. The resulting GWP of this agent is less than one, and its ODP when released at ground level is likely
to be extremely low, with current conservative estimates ranging from .008 to .01. Complete analysis of the ozone
depleting potential of this agent will be available in the near future. 

Anticipating EPA's concern about releases of CF

3

I from aircraft, and the associated likelihood of a higher ODP value when released at altitude, the military has conducted
an analysis of historical releases of Halon 1301 from both military and commercial aircraft. Initial assessment
indicate that emissions from U.S. military aircraft appear to have averaged about 56 pounds annually, of which 2 pounds
were emitted above 30,000 feet. Commercial aircraft worldwide released an estimated average of 933 pounds of Halon
1301 annually, of which 158 pounds was released above 30,000 feet. While EPA is awaiting the results of the ODP calculations
of CF

3

I, it is unlikely that such low emissions at high altitude will pose a significant threat to the ozone layer. 

Interest in this agent is very high because it may constitute a drop-in replacement to Halon 1301 on a weight and volume
basis. Initial tests have shown its weight equivalence for fire extinguishment to be 1.36, and its volume equivalence
to be 1.0, while for explosion inertion it is 1.42 and 1.04 respectively. The research community is continuing to qualify
the properties of this agent, including its materials compatibility, its storage stability and its effectiveness.
While the manufacturer's SNAP submission only requests listing in normally unoccupied areas, preliminary cardiosensitization
data received by the Agency indicate that CF

3

I has a NOAEL of 0.2 per cent and a LOAEL of 0.4 per cent, and thus this agent would not suitably be for use in normally occupied
areas.
