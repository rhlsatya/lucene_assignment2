<DOCTITLE>Announcement of the William C. Foster Fellows Visiting Scholars Program for the 1995-96 School Year </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) will conduct a competition for selection of visiting scholars
to participate in ACDA's activities during the 1995-96 academic year. 

Section 28 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2568) provides that ``A program for visiting scholars
in the field of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament shall be established by the Director in order to obtain
the services of scholars from the faculties of recognized institutions of higher learning.'' The law states that
``The purpose of the program will be to give specialists in the physical sciences and other disciplines relevant to
the Agency's activities an opportunity for active participation in the arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament
activities of the Agency and to gain for the Agency the perspective and expertise such persons can offer * * *.
Fellows shall be chosen by a board consisting of the Director, who shall be the chairperson, and all former Directors
of the Agency.'' Scholars are known as William C. Foster Fellows, in honor of the first Director of ACDA, William C.
Foster, who served from the inception of ACDA in 1961 until 1969. 

ACDA began this program by competitively selecting six visiting scholars for the 1984-85 academic year. The
competition has continued each subsequent academic year until the present. One-year assignments will begin at a
mutually agreeable time after successful completion of all employment requirements. 

Positions are available in the Bureau of Strategic and Eurasian Affairs (SEA), the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs
(MA), the Bureau of Intelligence, Verification and Information Support (IVI), and the Bureau of Nonproliferation
Policy and Regional Arms Control (NP). A brochure is available describing these positions in detail. Evaluation
of applicants for appointments to these positions will focus upon the scholar's potential for providing expertise
or performing services needed by ACDA, rather than on the scholar's previously displayed interest in arms control.
While pursuit of the scholar's own line of research may sometimes be possible, support of such activity is not the purpose
of the program. 

Visiting scholars will be detailed to ACDA by their universities; the universities will be compensated for the scholar's
salary and benefits in accordance with the Intergovernmental Personnel Act and within Agency limitations. Visiting
scholars will also receive reimbursement for travel to and from the Washington, D.C. area for their one-year assignment
and either a per diem allowance during the one-year assignment or relocation costs. 

Visiting scholars must be citizens of the United States, on the faculty of a recognized institution of higher learning,
and tenured or on a tenure track or equivalent; they also must have served as a permanent career employee of the institution
for at least ninety days before selection for the program. ACDA is an equal opportunity employer. Selections will
be made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or physical handicap that does not interfere
with performance of duties. Prior to appointment applicants will be subject to a full-field background security
investigation for a Top Secret security clearance, as required by Section 45 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
Visiting scholars will also be subject to applicable Federal conflict of interest laws and standards of conduct.


To apply, candidates are asked to submit a letter outlining their interests and qualifications, a curriculum vitae,
copies of two publications, and additional supporting material such as letters of reference. The application deadline
for assignments for the 1995-1996 academic year is January 31, 1995, subject to extension at ACDA's discretion. ACDA
expects to announce tentative selections in the spring of 1995. 

To request an information brochure, please write to: Visiting Scholars Program, Office of Operations Analysis and
Information Management, Room 5726, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
20451 or call on (703) 302-7714.

Receipt of Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status for Genetically Engineered Tomato Line 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received a petition from DNA Plant
Technology Corporation seeking a determination of nonregulated status for its delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4.
The petition has been submitted in accordance with our regulations concerning the introduction of certain genetically
engineered organisms and products. In accordance with those regulations, we are soliciting public comments on whether
that genetically engineered tomato line presents a plant pest risk.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' regulate, among other things, the introduction
(importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of organisms and products altered or produced
through genetic engineering that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests. Such genetically
engineered organisms and products are considered ``regulated articles.'' 



The regulations in  340.6(a) provide that any person may submit a petition to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) seeking a determination that an article should not be regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Paragraphs (b)
and (c) of  340.6 describe the form that a petition for determination of nonregulated status must take and the
information that must be included in the petition. 

On August 16, 1994, APHIS received a petition from DNA Plant Technology Corporation (DNAP) of Oakland, CA, requesting
a determination of nonregulated status under 7 CFR part 340 for its delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 and
any progeny derived from hybrid crosses between that line and other non-transformed tomato varieties. The DNAP petition
states that delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 should not be regulated by APHIS because it does not present
a plant pest risk. 

As described in the petition, the delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 was developed using Transwitch

TM

 gene suppression technology to introduce a truncated version of an aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC) synthase
gene isolated from tomato into the tomato genome in the ``sense'' (i.e. normal) orientation, which resulted in tomato
plants that exhibit significantly reduced levels of ACC synthase and ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene is an endogenous
plant hormone known to play an important role in fruit ripening in climacteric fruit such as tomato. ACC synthase is
the rate-limiting enzyme that converts s-adenosylmethionine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carbolic acid, the immediate
precursor to ethylene. Inhibition of ACC synthase biosynthesis results in reduced levels of ethylene biosynthesis.
The fruit of these plants exhibited a delayed-ripening phenotype, but ripened normally when external ethylene was
applied. The tomato line for which DNAP is seeking a determination, line 1345-4, contains a gene that is derived
from the tomato ACC synthase gene but does not encode a functional ACC synthase enzyme. Tomato plants were produced
by inserting the truncated ACC synthase gene into the genome of tomato cultivar 91103-114. 

DNAP's delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 is currently considered a regulated article under the regulations
in 7 CFR part 340 because it contains gene sequences (vectors, promoters, and terminators) derived from plant pathogenic
sources. In the process of reviewing permit applications for field trials of DNAP's delayed-ripening tomato line
1345-4, APHIS determined that the vectors and other elements were disarmed and that the trials would not present
a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. 

In the Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa 

et seq.

), ``plant pest'' is defined as ``any living stage of: Any insects, mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or
other invertebrate animals, bacteria, fungi, other parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof, viruses, or
any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing, or any infectious substances, which can directly or indirectly
injure or cause disease or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured or other products
of plants.'' APHIS views this definition very broadly. The definition covers direct or indirect injury, disease
or damage not just to agricultural crops, but also to plants in general, for example, native species, as well as to organisms
that may be beneficial to plants, for example, honeybees, rhizobia, etc. 

Food or animal feed uses of DNAP's delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 may be subject to regulation by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 201 

et seq.

). FDA's policy statement concerning regulation of plants derived from new plant varieties was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984-23005). 

In accordance with  340.6(d) of the regulations, we are publishing this notice to inform the public that APHIS
will accept written comments regarding the petition from any interested person for a period of 60 days from the date
of this notice. The petition and any comments received are available for public review, and copies of the petition
may be ordered (see the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice). 

After the comment period closes, APHIS will review the data submitted by the petitioner, all written comments received
during the comment period, and any other relevant information. Based on the available information, APHIS will furnish
a response to the petitioner, either approving the petition in whole or in part, or denying the petition. APHIS will
then publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the regulatory status of DNAP's delayed-ripening tomato line 1345-4 and the availability of APHIS'
written decision.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

USDA_Soil Conservation Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

``Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact''.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality
Guidelines (40 CFR part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Guidelines (7 CFR part 650); the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared
for the Brandywine Creek Watershed, Supplemental Watershed Plan No. 6 in Chester County, Pennsylvania.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The environmental assessment of this federally-assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Richard N. Duncan, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement is not needed for this project.




The purpose of this project is to purchase 105 acres located adjacent to the Hibernia Lake Project at the Birch Run Structure
(PA-436F) in order to expand the recreational facilities in the area. These facilities would include access
roads, boat ramps, fishing piers, a ranger station, sanitary facilities, campgrounds, picnic tables and a maintenance
and storage area. Additional land is needed to provide adequate access to the lake for fishing, boating, camping,
hiking and picnicking.

The ``Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact'' (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency.
A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. The environmental
assessment and basic data may be reviewed by contacting Richard N. Duncan.

No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until thirty (30) days after the date of this
publication in the 

Federal Register

.




(This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 10.904_Watershed Protection
and Flood Prevention and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials.)

Initiation of Investigation 



We have examined the petition for pipe nipples from Mexico, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of pipe nipples from Mexico are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by 
February 7, 1995. 



International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of these actions and we have done so. 



Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by October 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of pipe nipples from
Mexico are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a) of the
Act, a negative ITC determination in this investigation will result in the termination of this investigation; otherwise,
the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

In applying the standard from SWR from Mexico to Global Trading's challenge in this case, we have determined that (1)
for the average yield per acre, the information submitted by Global Trading was not public information and (2) for
U.S. price, Global Trading submitted data regarding its own purchases of the subject merchandise from four PRC exporters.
Thus, we have found that neither of Global Trading's specific challenges meets the standard established in SWR from
Mexico and, therefore, we have not adjusted the data from the petition based on Global Trading's allegations. We note
that the petitioners used standard methodologies, which have been examined by the Department. 


Critical Circumstances 


In our preliminary determination, we found that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of fresh
garlic from the PRC. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act, we based our preliminary determination on a finding
of (1) knowledge of dumping because the estimated dumping margin for all exporters of fresh garlic in the PRC was in
excess of 25 percent, and (2) massive imports over a relatively short period of time because respondents failed to
respond to the Department's questionnaire. As a result, we assumed, as BIA, that imports have been massive. 
For the final determination, we have continued to use BIA as the basis for our determination of critical circumstances.
The BIA margin exceeds the 25 percent threshold for imputing knowledge of dumping to the importers of the subject merchandise.

In addition, we have adversely assumed, as BIA, a massive increase in imports because of the non-response of exporters.

Accordingly, because the dumping margin is sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping, and because we have determined
that imports of fresh garlic have been massive, we determine that critical circumstances do exist with respect to
fresh garlic from the PRC. 


Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 735(d)(1) and 735(c)(4)(A) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue
to suspend liquidation of all entries of fresh garlic from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section
of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 12, 1994, which is
90 days before the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. 






ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this determination.
The ITC will determine, within 45 days, whether these imports are causing material injury, or threat thereof, to the
industry in the U.S. producing the subject merchandise. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat thereof,
does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities posted will be refunded or cancelled. If the ITC
determines that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officials
to assess antidumping duties on all imports of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after the effective date of the suspension of liquidation. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications for its Buffalo, New York Minority Business Development Center (MBDC). The purpose of
the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to help establish
and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public
and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
The MBDC will provide service in the Buffalo, New York Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 02-10-95003-01.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from March 1, 1995 to February 28, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount of $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $29,846 in non-federal
(cost sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.




The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.


Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determinations of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. 

The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business. 

Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities. 

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs'', is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In the event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information and requirements for
this project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.




Pre-Award Costs

_Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their
own risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal assurance that an applicant may have
received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs. 

Awards under this program shall be subject to all Federal laws, and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies,
and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. 



Outstanding Account Receivable

_No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either
the delinquent account is paid in full, repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or
other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made. 



Name Check Policy

_All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to
reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal
charges such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management
honesty or financial integrity. 



Award Termination

_The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to
meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MBDC work requirements; and reporting inaccurate
or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law. 



False Statements

_A false statement on an application for Federal financial assistance is grounds for denial or termination of funds,
and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001. 



Primary Applicant Certifications

_All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD-511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.''

on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying
section of the certification form prescribed above applies to applications/bids for grants, cooperative agreements,
and contracts for more than $100,000. 



Anti-Lobbying Disclosures

_Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying
Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR Part 28, Appendix B. 



Lower Tier Certifications

_Recipients shall require applications/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts, or other lower tier covered
transactions at any tier under the award to submit, if applicable, a completed Form CD-512, ``Certifications
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered Transactions and
Lobbying'' and disclosure form, SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.'' Form CD-512 is intended
for the use of recipients and should not be transmitted to DOC. SF-LLL submitted by any tier recipient or subrecipient
should be submitted to DOC in accordance with the instructions contained in the award document. 



Buy American Made Equipment or Products

_Applicants are hereby notified that they are encouraged, to the extent feasible, to purchase American-made equipment

The United States Government has determined to rescind the current restraint level on textile products in Categories
340/640 from El Salvador in view of recent statistical information concerning a restraint on these categories at
this time. 

The United States reserves its right under the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done in Geneva
on December 20, 1973 and extended on December 14, 1977, December 22, 1981, July 31, 1986, December 9, 1992 and December
9, 1993, to place these Categories 340/640 under a restraint should the statistical information change in the future.


In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to cancel the current limit
for Categories 340/640.

Should it become necessary to discuss Categories 340/640 with the Government of El Salvador at a later date, further
notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.


A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

 notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 58 FR 35501, published on July 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


A. Purpose



In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631, 

et seq.

), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns
participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract or a modification
to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides
maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required
to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and are implemented in FAR 19.7.
In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit reports of their progress on SF 295, Summary Subcontract
Report. In addition, OFPP Policy Letter 91-1, Government-Wide Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business
Goals for Procurement Contracts, requires Executive branch departments and agencies to report the number and dollar
value of subcontracts awarded to small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business.
The report is being expanded to collect information on the number of subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged
business and women-owned small business which is not currently collected by the report.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE/NV announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it is awarding a noncompetitive
financial assistance grant for the research of detector materials for nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This award will provide financial support to the Nuclear Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) in order to continue materials research work for detectors to aid nonproliferation of weapons
of mass destruction. The MIT graduate and doctoral students have made exceptional progress in refining the purity

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (e)
and (f) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) to Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University based on an Unsolicited Proposal submitted to DOE by the University.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) has proposed to DOE to cost share, by approximately 20%,
a program to assist the U.S. coal industry to improve its efficiency in producing lower sulfur coals. VPI will be the
lead organization of the Appalachian Clean Coal Technology Consortium (ACCTC). ACCTC involves three universities
(VPI, West Virginia University and the University of Kentucky) as charter members, and five coal companies, an A&E
firm and an equipment company as affiliate members. The objectives of the consortium are (1) to increase the production
of lower sulfur coals, (2) to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the international market, (3) to create
high-tech jobs in the economically-depressed areas of Appalachia, (4) to reduce the nation's dependency of foreign
energy supplies, (5) to produce coals from refuse ponds in useable forms, and (6) to minimize the impact of coal burning
on the environment. Cooperative relationships with coal companies, equipment manufacturers, and A&E firms
are planned to assist in achieving the objectives. The work will entail (1) development of new advanced coal cleaning
technologies, (2) improvement of the efficiency of existing coal cleaning technologies, (3) information exchange,
and (4) train personnel/work force for industry. 


In accordance with 10 CFR 600.14 (e) and (f), acceptance of an Unsolicited Proposal from VPI has been justified. DOE
support of the ACCTC activities would provide a unique and innovative method of enhancement of the competitiveness
of U.S. coals that would otherwise be unavailable. This effort is therefore considered suitable for noncompetitive
financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation. 
DOE funding for this research is estimated to be approximately $250,000 for a 12 month period of performance. These
funds shall be used to pay for the reasonable cost of research staff and support personnel necessary for the overall
project.

September 19, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Northern Natural Gas Company 


[Docket No. CP94-763-000] 



Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas
77002, filed in Docket No. CP94-763-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act
for issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of
facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.


Northern proposes to construct and operate: (1) 1.42 miles of 30-inch mainline piping on Northern's C-Line in Washington
County, Minnesota; (2) one town border station in Washington County; and (3) a 1,250 horsepower compressor unit in
Northern's Farmington compressor station in Dakota County, Minnesota. Northern proposes an in-service date of
October 12, 1996. Northern states that the total estimated cost of the proposed facilities is $4,247,000. 

Northern asserts that the proposed facilities would expand the capacity of its system by 29,120 Mcf per day. Northern
further asserts that it would use the expanded capacity to render firm transportation services to Peoples Natural
Gas Company, a division of Utilicorp United, Inc. (Peoples) for service to LS Power-Cottage Grove Limited Partnership
(LS Power). 

Northern states that it has entered into a precedent agreement (Agreement) for firm transportation service with
LS Power for 29,120 Mcf per day for a primary term of 20 years. Northern also states that Peoples has agreed to roll-over
their currently existing firm transportation service for a quantity equal to 29,120 Mcf per day for a term equal to
the term of the Agreement. Northern asserts that Peoples has agreed to permanently release the rolled-over capacity
to LS Power as firm transportation capacity on Northern in Zone EF. 

Comment date: October 11, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

77252, filed in Docket No. CP94-775-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon certain pipeline facilities located offshore Louisiana, all as more fully
set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Tennessee proposes to abandon its West Cameron 173/180 system by sale to Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron). Tennessee
states that the system consists of the following. 

(1) Approximately 1.27 miles of 10-inch pipeline (507K-1900) together with Meter No. 1-1223, measurement
and appurtenant facilities, located in West Cameron Block 180. 
(2) Approximately 0.4 miles of 6-inch pipeline (507K-2200) together with Meter No. 1-1790, measurement
and appurtenant facilities located in West Cameron Block 173.

Tennessee further states that, pursuant to a letter of intent dated March 8, 1994, Chevron would pay $600,000 for the
facilities; which represents a loss of $316,504 when compared to the net book value. 

Tennessee advises that the gas purchase and sales agreements associated with the facilities have been terminated
and there are no other active contracts involved with the facilities. 

Comment date: October 11, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Government Intercity Telecommunications Services; FTS2000 Contracts; Notice</DOCTITLE>



The Federal government currently satisfies its intercity telecommunications services through the Federal Telecommunications
System 2000 (FTS2000) contracts. The existing FTS2000 contracts will expire in 1998. As a part of the continuing,
open discussion related to the post-FTS2000 provision of telecommunications services to Federal government users,
the government hereby advises interested parties of the following opportunities to participate in this discussion.

The government will release a report entitled, ``Analysis of Post-FTS2000 Acquisition Alternatives'' on or about
September 26, 1994. The report states the goals of the Post-FTS2000 acquisitions; provides a preliminary definition
of the scope of the Post-FTS2000 acquisitions; describes the acquisition strategies being considered; summarizes
the status of the government's analysis; and solicits views and comments from all interested parties, such as public,
industry, academia, and other government agencies, that will assist the government in determining the Post-FTS2000
acquisition strategy most advantageous to the government.

This report was prepared, as a framework for further study, by the Acquisition Working Group, a subcommittee of the
Interagency Management Council. At present, the government plans to make the report available for public viewing
in the General Services Administration Bid Room, located at 7th and D Streets, SW, Room 1701, Washington, DC 20407
on or about September 26, 1994. The report will be electronically accessible via the Internet in one of two methods.
Files may be downloaded electronically via anonymous FTP from post.fts2k.gsa.gov under the /pub directory. Files
may also be pursued (and downloaded) and full-text searches may be made via a World Wide Web client (such as Mosaic)
by accessing our home page, whose URL is http:/ /post.fts2k.gsa.gov/. The government will accept written comments
on the report, through October 17, 1994. Comments may be submitted to the General Services Administration, Attention:
Concept Development Record, c/o The MITRE Corporation, 7525 Colshire Drive (STOP Z397), McLean, VA 22102. It is preferred
that comments be submitted electronically to an Internet address of cdr@post.fts2k.gsa.gov in any of the following
four formats: Ordinary ASCII; PostScript; unencoded representations of Microsoft Word (version 6.0 and earlier)
documents; and unencoded representations of Word Perfect (version 6.0 and earlier) documents.

The government also invites oral comments on this document for presentation before a Government Panel, consisting
of members of the Interagency Management Council, at the ``Post-FTS2000 Comments Review Panel Meeting'' to be held
October 25, 26, and 27, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., at the Department of State's Dean Acheson Auditorium, 2201 C Street,
NW, Washington, DC 20520. Requests for an opportunity to speak and/or to attend the meeting will require advance reservation
with the understanding that the government will limit the number of presentations based on time constraints and space.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case: 





Gerald J. August, Ph.D., University of Minnesota Medical School:

 The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) reviewed an investigation
conducted by the University of Minnesota into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Gerald J. August, Ph.D.,
an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The University concluded that
Dr. August committed scientific misconduct by plagiarizing materials in a Public Health Service (PHS) grant application
which he obtained as a member of a PHS Special Study Section. ORI concurred with the University's findings. Dr. August
accepted the misconduct findings and agreed to a Voluntary Settlement Agreement under which, for a five year period
beginning May 6, 1994, (1) Dr. August will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups and (2)
he is to submit a certification with each document, application, or report that he submits to a PHS component that the
work of others contained in the document, application, or report is properly attributed.

Miscellaneous Compliance Policy Guides; Revocation


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of three compliance policy guides (CPG's) because
they are outdated. This action is being taken to ensure that FDA's CPG's accurately reflect FDA policy.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is revoking three of its CPG's because either they no longer reflect FDA policy, or they have been superseded by
more comprehensive guidance. The following three guides are being revoked:


(1) CPG 7125.03 ``Sale of Prescription-legend Veterinary Drugs'' 
The information contained in CPG 7125.03 also is found in Compliance Program 7371.002, and the information in Compliance
Program 7371.002 is more current and thorough than that contained in CPG 7125.03. Therefore, CPG 7125.03 is obsolete.

(2) CPG 7125.10 ``Veterinarian Use of New Animal Drug Substances'' 
This CPG states that veterinarians may use within their practice whatever bulk drugs they may legally obtain, i.e.,
those that do not require a new animal drug application (NADA). This policy implies that the requirement for a NADA
is the exceptional situation. In fact, in most cases, an approved NADA is required before bulk drug substances could
be used by veterinarians to produce a finished pharmaceutical. This position was upheld in 

United States

 v. 

9/1 KG Containers, More or Less, of an Article of Drug for Veterinary Use [Schuyler Laboratories, Inc.]

, 854 F.2d 173 (7th Cir. 1988). Therefore, FDA is revoking CPG 7125.10 so that agency policy will not be misinterpreted.
Furthermore, FDA is in the process of developing policy guidance pertaining to the compounding of drugs for veterinary
use that will be issued in due course.
(3) CPG 7126.02 ``Gentian Violet in Animal Feed''
In a memo dated August 16, 1991, FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) informed all district offices and all resident
posts that this CPG was no longer CVM policy. CPG 7126.02 was not revoked at the time. That oversight is now being corrected.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 721(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(5))), notice is given that a color
additive petition (CAP 4C0244) has been filed by ProMedica International, 620 Newport Center Dr., suite 575, Newport
Beach, CA 92660. The petition proposes to amend the color additive regulations in  74.3045 

[Phthalocyaninato(2-)] copper

 (21 CFR 74.3045) to provide for the safe use of [phthalocyaninato(2-)] copper as a color additive in nonabsorbable
polyvinylidene fluoride sutures intended for use in general and ophthalmic surgery.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before October

environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).

General function of the committee

. The committee reviews and evaluates data on the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational devices
and makes recommendations for their regulation.


Agenda_Open public hearing

. Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee.
Those desiring to make formal presentations should notify the contact person before September 30, 1994, and submit
a brief statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present, the names and addresses of
proposed participants, and an indication of the approximate time required to make their comments.


Open committee discussion

. The committee will discuss general issues relating to a premarket approval application (PMA) for an excimer laser
for photorefractive keratectomy. There will be a diagnostic and surgical devices update presented to the panel including
the current status of the pending PMA's for phototherapeutic keratectomy lasers. There will be announcements in
the contact lens area that will include labeling issues regarding disposable lenses, and an update on: (1) The progress
of contact lens care product reclassification, and (2) the development of guidance on clinical endpoints for extended
wear contact lens studies. Announcements on intraocular implant issues are planned. 



Closed presentation of data

. The committee will discuss trade secret and/or confidential commercial information relevant to investigational
device exemption applications and PMA's for contact lenses, surgical and diagnostic devices, and intraocular implants.
This portion of the meeting will be closed to permit discussion of this information (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4)).

Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above. 
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Performance Standards for State Medicaid Fraud Control Units </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Inspector General, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 1902(a)(61) of the Social Security Act and the authority delegated to the Inspector General,
this notice sets forth standards for assessing the performance of the State Medicaid Fraud Control Units. These standards
will be used in the certification and recertification of each Unit and to determine if a Unit is effectively and efficiently
carrying out its duties and responsibilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


 
I. Background 



Since the enactment of the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977, authorizing the establishment
and funding for Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs), 42 States have created such fraud control units to investigate
and prosecute Medicaid provider fraud and patient abuse and neglect in Medicaid funded facilities. 

A MFCU must be a single, identifiable entity of the State government composed of (i) one or more attorneys experienced
in investigating or prosecuting civil fraud or criminal cases who are capable of giving informed advice on applicable
law and procedures and providing effective prosecution or liaison with other prosecutors; (ii) one or more experienced
auditors capable of supervising the review of financial records and advising or assisting in the investigation of
alleged fraud; and (iii) a senior investigator with substantial experience in commercial or financial investigations
who is capable of supervising and directing the investigative activities of the unit. While the preference of the
enabling legislation has been for the unit to investigate and prosecute its own cases on a Statewide basis, the legislative
history recognizes that not all States are lawfully able to establish the MFCU to do so. 

The State Medicaid agency is required to enter into an agreement with the MFCU to refer all suspected cases of provider
fraud to the unit, and to comply with the unit's requests for provider records or computerized data that is kept by the
Medicaid agency. To ensure that Medicaid overpayments identified by a MFCU in the course of its investigations are
recovered, each MFCU is required either to undertake civil recovery actions or have procedures to refer overpayments
for collection to other appropriate State agencies.

The HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is delegated the authority to certify and recertify the MFCUs to ensure that
the units fully comply with the governing statute and with Federal regulations set forth in 42 CFR part 1007. As part
of its recertification process, the OIG reviews the State fraud units' applications for recertification and may
conduct on-site visits to the units to observe their operations. The OIG also collects and analyzes statistical data
on the number and type of cases under investigation, the number of convictions obtained, and the amount of recoveries.




II. Use Of Performance Standards 



Section 13625 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66, amended section 1902 of the
Social Security Act by adding a new paragraph (a)(61) that establishes a Medicaid State plan requirement that, effective
January 1, 1995, a State must operate a MFCU in accordance with standards to be established by the Secretary. 

The OIG intends to use these performance standards in the certification and recertification of a Unit, as well as for
assessing the effectiveness of a Unit during on-site reviews. 



III. Standards For Assessing The MFCUS 



In cooperation with the Units themselves, represented by a working group from the National Association of Medicaid
Fraud Control Units, the OIG has developed twelve performance standards to be used in evaluating a Unit's performance.
Each of the current Unit directors has concurred with the standards and accompanying requirements or indicators
set forth below.

At 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1994 the above described land will become open to the location under the United Stats
mining laws. Appropriation of the land under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized.
Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38, shall vest no rights
against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed
by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between
rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts.

The land has been and will remain open to the operation of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, as amended (43 U.S.C.
869, 869-1 to 869-4), and to leasing under the mineral leasing laws.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice informs asylum applicants of the elimination of a Post Office Box as the mailing address for the Arlington

for these offices should be forwarded to the appropriate street address of these Asylum Offices.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Arlington and Miami Asylum Offices will eliminate Post Office Box numbers as mailing addresses for all correspondence
that pertains to an asylum case pending in an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Asylum Office. Effective
with the publication of this notice, all correspondence intended for either the Miami or Arlington Asylum Offices
should be mailed to the appropriate street address.



The elimination of the post office box addresses for the Arlington and Miami Asylum Office does not affect the current
manner in which one applies for asylum in the United States. Asylum applicants are to submit their applications and
supporting documents to the INS Service Center that serves the Asylum Office having jurisdiction over the applicant's
place of residence.



Arlington Asylum Office

<DOCTITLE>Notice on Circuit Ride Location Changes for Asylum Offices</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice informs asylum applicants of changes in certain interview locations. The purpose of this notice is to
advise certain asylum applicants that they will be scheduled for an interview at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) Asylum Office having jurisdiction over their place of residence, rather than having an interview conducted
on a circuit ride.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In 1991, the INS established seven Asylum Offices, in: Arlington, VA; Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Los Angeles, CA; Miami,
FL; Newark, NJ; and San Francisco, CA. These offices are situated close to where the majority of asylum applicants
reside.



The vest majority of asylum interviews are conducted at the Asylum Office sites. Asylum Officers periodically visit
Ports-of-Entry and District and file control offices that are more than 300 miles from the Asylum Office site in order
to interview asylum applicants. Since 1991, and depending upon the number of asylum applications received [receipts],
Asylum Officers have also conducted interviews on their circuit rides at locations within the 300-mile radius mentioned
above.
Effective with this publication, the Asylum Office Directors intend only to schedule circuit rides to INS District
or file control offices and Ports-of-Entry more than 300 miles from the Asylum Office site. If an interview site at
the INS District or file control office or Port-of-Entry is within 300 miles of the Asylum Office site having jurisdiction
over the applicant's place of residence, the applicant's interview will be scheduled at the local INS Asylum Office.
Interviews that have already been scheduled to take place on a circuit ride and that are within the 300 mile radius of
the Asylum Office will not be affected by this notice and will be conducted as scheduled.

The effect of having an interview scheduled at the INS Asylum Office rather than on a circuit ride is threefold: (1)
Asylum Office Directors will be able to increase the number of available interview slots within a given month; (2)
asylum applicants will be able to have an interview scheduled more expeditiously; and (3) asylum applicants will
be able to receive a more timely adjudication of their claim.



Arlington Asylum Office



Effective upon publication of this notice, applicants who reside in North Carolina or within the jurisdiction of
the INS suboffice in Pittsburgh, PA, will have their interviews conducted at the Arlington Asylum Office. Applicants
who reside in South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama will have their interviews conducted on a circuit ride to Atlanta,
GA.

The Arlington Asylum Office is located at 1500 Wilson Blvd., Lobby Level, Arlington, VA 22209.



Chicago Asylum Office



Effective upon publication of this notice, applicants who reside in Michigan, including the upper peninsula, will
have their interviews conducted at the Chicago Asylum Office.

The Chicago Asylum Office is located at 209 South LaSalle Street, Suite 625, Chicago, IL 60604.

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is announcing the availability of the NASA FAR Supplement in electronic
form in order to satisfy requests for an electronic copy of the publication. With appropriate software, users will
be able to search the copy using keywords.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1), notice is given that NFS Version 89.16, effective September 30, 1994, is available in
WordPerfect 5.1. For as long as we can accommodate requests, a copy will be sent by e-mail, without charge, to anyone
sending an 



e-mail request. We are supplying the NFS by e-mail until we place the NFS on Internet. 




The electronic copy contains the text that is used to produce the loose-leaf version of the NFS. The NFS is also published
in 48 CFR Chapter 18. Efforts are made to minimize the differences between the loose-leaf version and 48 CFR Chapter
18. However, neither the electronic copy nor the loose-leaf version are a substitute for the Code of Federal Regulations
or the 

Federal Register

.

The copy supplied by e-mail will be a compressed file of 964 kilobytes along with shareware (pkunzip.exe, 30 kilobytes)
for decompressing the file. When the file is ``unzipped'' it becomes 122 WordPerfect 5.1 files (plus a README file)
totalling 3 megabytes. Persons using WordPerfect 5.1, or software capable of converting from WordPerfect 5.1, should
be able to search the text of the 122 files using keywords.






(Caution: When converted to ASCII, some text and most tables are difficult to read. We will try to improve later versions
of the NFS to eliminate this problem.)

petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors:
(1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding;
(2) The nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and
(3) The possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition
should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes
to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend
the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehering conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion and the petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists
with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the
amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief.
A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention
will not be permitted to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the pportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NFP-39 and NPF-85, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to permit an increase in the allowable leak rate
for the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs), and delete the MSIV Leakage Control System (LCS). The main steam drain
lines and the main condenser would be utilized as an alternate MSIV leakage treatment system.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By October 26, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street, Pottstown,
Pennsylvania 19464. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition

(3) The possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition
should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes
to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend
the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled
in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specifically requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement

<DOCTITLE>Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Management and Budget.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Revision to OMB Circular A-122. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice is a corrected version of the Notice previously printed on September 16, 1994 (59 FR 47657). This corrected
version contains additional text under ``Supplementary Information.'' This Notice offers interested parties
an opportunity to comment on a proposed revision to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-122, ``Cost
Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The revision will allow Federal agencies to reimburse non-profit organizations
for interest on debt used to finance the purchase of buildings and equipment, when purchasing using debt financing
is less costly than leasing.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this revision is to: (1) Encourage non-profit organizations to acquire building space and equipment
necessary for administering Federal programs at the lowest possible cost to the Federal Government, and (2) bring
greater consistency to Federal policies covering the allowability of interest by organizations receiving Federal
awards. 



As the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated in 1980, it had been ``a longstanding policy not to recognize interest
as a cost'' (45 FR 46022, 46023, July 8, 1980). Accordingly, the OMB circulars setting forth the cost principles for
State and local governments, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations did not originally allow
interest as an expense. Over time, however, OMB has gradually expanded the allowability of interest. 

The first change was made with respect to State and local governments. In 1980, Circular 74-4, ``Cost Principles
for Grants to States and Local Governments,'' was revised to allow interest on buildings, but not on equipment (45
FR 27363, April 22, 1980). This policy was retained when Circular 74-4 was reissued the following year as revised
OMB Circular A-87 (46 FR 9548, January 28, 1981).

<TEXT>
 

OMB then revised the policy with respect to educational institutions. In 1982, Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles
for Educational Institutions,'' was revised to allow interest for both buildings and equipment (47 FR 33658, August
3, 1982). 

OMB has since revisited the policy with respect to State and local governments. In 1988 and 1993, OMB proposed to revise
Circular A-87 to allow interest on equipment, as well as on buildings (53 FR 40352, October 14, 1988; 58 FR 44212,
August 19, 1993). OMB expects to issue a notice shortly that would make final revisions to Circular A-87. 

OMB is now proposing to change the policy with respect to non-profit organizations. In this notice, OMB proposes to
revise Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' so that interest would be allowed
for both buildings and equipment. Based on OMB's experience under the three cost principles circulars, OMB believes
that the proposal would result in lower costs to the Federal Government. In addition, this proposal would result in
greater consistency on the allowability of interest across the three cost principles circulars. 

During the last few years, OMB has received a number of requests for waivers from Circular A-122's prohibition
on the allowability of interest. As a result of reviewing the individual waiver requests, and based on the general
experience gained under Circulars A-87, A-21, and A-122, OMB believes that allowing interest should
encourage non-profit organizations to purchase rather than lease facilities in those situations where purchasing
would result in lower costs than leasing. Consequently, OMB has decided to propose revising Circular A-122's
interest policy. 

This proposed revision to Circular A-122 would establish four criteria that must be met for interest to be an
allowable cost. These criteria are intended to encourage decisions beneficial to the non-profit organization and
the Federal Government. First, the non-profit organization must perform a lease/purchase analysis which shows
that purchasing through debt financing is less costly to the Federal Government than leasing. Second, financing
is provided at an interest rate no higher than the fair market rate. Third, investment earnings are used to offset allowable
interest cost. Fourth, when it is expected that the Federal Government will reimburse 51 percent or more of an asset's
cost, the non-profit organization must demonstrate the need for the asset in the conduct of federally sponsored activities.
The fourth criterion is in addition to that which applies to State and local governments (Circular A-87) and
educational institutions (Circular A-21). 

OMB believes that the first and fourth criteria are especially important in the context of grants to non-profit organizations.
As a general rule, the Federal Government contributes a small share of the costs of assets purchased by State and local
governments and educational institutions. Since those entities must themselves fund the majority of the costs associated
with acquiring an asset, they have an incentive to make the most economical lease/purchase decision. In contrast,
for non-profit organizations covered by Circular A-122, the Federal share of costs is often substantial. Since
this greater Federal share could decrease the incentive for non-profit organizations to make the most economical
lease/purchase decisions, these additional criteria are designed to ensure that a non-profit's decision to purchase
rather than lease is based on an assessment of the relative costs of leasing versus purchasing, and a demonstrated
need for the asset (where the Federal Government will reimburse over half the asset's cost). 

The revised policy would apply only to assets acquired after its final issuance. 

OMB requests comments on all aspects of this proposal.

The following paragraph is proposed to replace paragraph 19.a of Attachment A to Circular A-122: 

19. Interest, fund raising, and investment management costs. 

a. Interest. 

(1) Interest on debt is unallowable unless: 

(a) The non-profit organization performs a lease/purchase analysis in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,
Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' and OMB Circular A-94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for
Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' sections 5a, 8(c)(2), and 13, which shows that purchasing through
debt financing is less costly to the Federal Government than leasing. Discount rates used should be equal to the grantee's
borrowing rates, to be consistent with Circular A-94's intent to reflect the entity's cost of financing. The
financial analysis must include a comparison of the present value of the projected total cash flows of both alternatives
over the period the asset is expected to be used by the non-profit organization in carrying out federally sponsored
activities. The cash flows associated with purchasing the asset must include the purchase price, anticipated operating
and maintenance costs (including property taxes, if applicable) not included in the debt financing, less any estimated
asset salvage value at the end of the period defined above. Projected rental costs should be based on the anticipated
cost of renting comparable facilities or equipment at fair market rates over the period defined above, and any expected
maintenance costs and property taxes to be borne by the non-profit organization directly or as part of the lease arrangement.


(b) Financing is provided at an interest rate no higher than the fair market rate. 

(c) Investment earnings, including interest, on bond or loan principal, pending payment of the construction or acquisition
costs, are used to offset allowable interest cost. Arbitrage earnings reportable to the Internal Revenue Service
are not required to be offset against allowable interest costs. 

(d) Where the Federal Government's reimbursement is expected to equal or exceed 51 percent of an asset's cost, the
non-profit organization conducts an assessment that demonstrates the need for the asset in the conduct of federally
sponsored activities. For assets costing in excess of $10 million, the needs assessment must be approved in advance
by the cognizant Federal agency as a prerequisite to the allowability of depreciation and interest on debt related
to the facility. For assets costing less than $10 million, the needs assessment must be maintained on file for review
by the Federal Government. 

(2) Interest on debt issued to finance or refinance assets acquired before or reacquired after the effective date
of this policy is not allowable. 

(3) Federal cognizant agencies shall require non-profit organizations to compute interest on the excess of the depreciation
and interest reimbursement over the bond principal and interest payments, and that the organizations treat the computed
interest as a reduction in the interest expense to be reimbursed by the Federal Government. This provision is not applicable
in instances where the non-profit organization makes an initial equity contribution of 25 percent or more to purchase
the asset(s). 

(4) Substantial relocation of federally sponsored activities from a facility financed by indebtedness, the cost
of which was funded in whole or part through Federal reimbursements, to another facility prior to the expiration of
the useful life of the facility requires Federal cognizant agency approval. The extent of the relocation, the amount
of the Federal participation in the financing, and the depreciation charged to date may require negotiation of space
charges for Federal programs.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. Relating to Substituting Component Securities of the CBOE Mexico Index.


September 20, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),

1

 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,

2

 notice is hereby given that on September 2, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE seeks authority to replace one component security in the CBOE Mexico Index (``Mexico Index'' or ``Index''),
with a closed-end country fund. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE,
and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The Mexico Index, on which options are currently traded on the Exchange, is composed of stocks and American Depositary
Receipts (``ADRs'') representing ten Mexican companies.

3

 The Index meets the generic criteria for listing options set forth in CBOE Rule 24.2. The Exchange is not proposing
that the Commission grant the Exchange the authority to replace a component security in the Index with the Mexico Fund,
a closed-end fund consisting of Mexican securities, if the Exchange decides that such a substitution is necessary
or desirable. The CBOE will not replace any component security with the Mexico Fund unless after such substitution
the Index will continue to meet the initial listing and maintenance criteria specified in CBOE Rule 24.2. The purpose
of such a substitution would be to make the Index more attractive to investors and to facilitate hedging of the Index
by substituting a more liquid component.





The Exchange expects that the substitution of the Mexico Fund for a component security in the Index could achieve these
purposes for at least two reasons. First, the CBOE believes, the Index will become more representative of the Mexican
economy because the Mexico Fund is composed of numerous Mexican securities representative of diverse sectors of
the Mexican economy. Second, the Exchange believes, the substitution will enhance liquidity of the components of
the Index to the extent that the Mexico Fund replaces a component security that maintains a lower monthly trading volume.
Based on average monthly trading through August 31, 1994, the Exchange represents that the Mexico Fund has historically
experienced a greater monthly trading volume than at least half of the component securities that currently comprise
the Index.

Although the Mexico Fund is not currently eligible for equity options, it meets all criteria that component securities
of the Index are required to satisfy. First, the Mexico Fund had a market value of $1,187,567,000 as of August 1, 1994,
which is far in excess of the initial listing and maintenance criterion requiring minimum market capitalization
of at least $75,000,000. Also, the Mexico Fund had average monthly trading volume of 5.4 million shares for the six
month period through July 1994. The monthly trading volume did not drop below 2.8 million shares during that period.

The substitution of the Mexico Fund for a component security in the Index would also be consistent with the initial
listing and maintenance criterion that no component security of the Index account for in excess of 25% of the weight
of the Index. Even though the Mexico Fund may contain common stocks and ADRs that are also components of the Index, because
the Index is equal dollar-weighted, the Mexico Fund will comprise 10% of the weight of the Index immediately following
each quarterly rebalancing of the Index. As a result, even if it were possible for the Mexico Fund to consist entirely
of another Index component security, that component security could at most constitute 20% of the weight of the Index
immediately following each quarterly rebalancing of the Index, below the 25% specified in the initial listing and
maintenance criteria for the Index.

Finally, the Exchange will not substitute the Mexico Fund for a component security of the Index unless securities
representing at least 90% of the Index by weight and 80% of the Index by number of components will continue to be eligible
for the trading of equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3, as required by the initial listing and maintenance criteria
for the Index. The Mexico Fund currently is not eligible for the trading of equity options. Because one component of
the Mexico Fund, Grupo Financiero Serfin SA de CV (``Grupo Serfin'') also is not options eligible, in order to remain
in compliance with the listing standards, the Exchange presently could substitute the Mexico Fund only for Grupo
Serfin. If in the future, however, Grupo Serfin or the Mexico Fund become options eligible, the Exchange could substitute
the Mexico Fund for another component security and remain in compliance with the maintenance standards for the Index.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, the substitution of the Mexico Fund for a component security of the Index would not impact the Index criterion
limiting the number of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts that are components of the Index because
the Mexico Fund is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which is the primary market for the fund shares.
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons facilitating transactions
in securities, and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and protect investors
and the public interest.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Exchange consents, the Commission
will:
(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE.
All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-31 and should be submitted by October 17, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, et al.</DOCTITLE>


September 19, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an Order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'' or ``Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (``MassMutual''), MML Bay State Life Insurance Company (``MML Bay
State''), Massachusetts Mutual Variable Annuity Separate Account 3 (``Separate Account 3''), MML Bay State Variable
Annuity Separate Account 1 (``Separate Account 1'') (Separate Account 3 and Separate Account 1, collectively, the
``Separate Accounts''), and MML Investors Services, Inc. (``MMLISI'') (MassMutual, MML Bay State, the Separate
Accounts, and MMLISI, collectively, ``Applicants'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Section 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) thereof.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an Order to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge and enhanced death benefit
expense charge in connection with the offer and sale of certain flexible premium variable annuity contracts to be
funded by the Separate Accounts (``Contracts'').


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. MassMutual is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. MML
Bay State is a life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Missouri and is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of MassMutual. MMLISI is the principal underwriter of the Contracts and also is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MassMutual.
2. Separate Account 3 was established on January 12, 1994 to fund Contracts issued by MassMutual. Separate Account
1 was established on January 14, 1994 to fund Contracts issued by MML Bay State. Each Separate Account is registered
as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.
3. The Separate Accounts will be used for the purpose of investing purchase payments received under the Contracts.
The Contracts require certain minimum initial payments and permit additional flexible purchase payments. A Contract
owner may, after deductions of applicable charges, direct allocation of purchase payments among the various divisions
of the Separate Accounts. Additionally, both MassMutual and MML Bay State will make available, in a limited number
of states, a flexible account (the ``Fixed Account'') to which purchase payments may be allocated. The Fixed Account
will include a market value adjustment feature. Each Separate Account has filed a registration statement on Form
N-4 with the Commission in connection with the Contracts.
4. Each Separate Account is divided into twelve divisions. Each division invests in corresponding shares of either
MML Series Investment Trust or Oppenheimer Variable Account Funds (collectively, the ``Trusts''). The Trusts are
registered with the SEC as diversified open-end management investment companies.
5. The Contracts provide for certain charges. An administrative charge is assessed annually and upon the surrender
or the payment of a death benefit under the Contracts. The administrative charge will be waived if a Contract's accumulated
value is at least $50,000 as of the date of assessment. The administrative charge currently is $30 per year and will
not be increased above $50 per year.
6. In addition to the $30 annual administrative charge, an annual administrative charge equal to 0.15% of the assets
of each Separate Account will be deducted for administrative charges (the $30 annual administrative charge and the
0.15% annual administrative charge, collectively, the ``administrative charges''). The administrative charges
are intended to reimburse MassMutual or MML Bay State for expenses related to the maintenance of the Contracts and
for operation of the Separate Accounts in connection with the Contracts. Applicants represent that these fees are
based on current estimates by MassMutual and MML Bay State of administrative costs for these services over the lifetime
of the Contracts. These charges are guaranteed never to be increased beyond stated maximums during the term of a Contract,
and such fees are neither designed nor expected to generate a profit. Applicants rely on Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act
to assess such fees.
7. While no sales charges are deducted when premium payments are received, the Contracts are subject to a schedule
of contingent deferred sales charges (``sales charge''). A sales charge may be imposed upon full or partial redemptions,
upon maturity of the Contract, and upon certain death benefits. Sales charges are based on the purchase payments made
and the time that has passed since receipt of such payment. The part of the sales charge related to a purchase payment
is a level percentage of that payment depending on the years that have passed since the purchase payment was received.
During the first year since payment, the sales charge is 7 percent. For each successive year, the sales charge decreases
1 percent until it becomes zero in the eighth year. The amount deducted for sales charges at any time, plus any sales
charges previously deducted, will not be more than 7% of the total purchase payments made to that time. In addition,
during each Contract year, a Contract owner may redeem the following amounts without incurring a sales charge: (1)
All unredeemed purchase payments that are at least seven years old, and (2) 10% of the unredeemed purchase payments
that are less than seven years old.
8. An annual charge will be assessed against the assets of each Separate Account for mortality and expense risks assumed
by MassMutual or MML Bay State. The mortality and expense risk charge currently is 1.15% and will not be increased above
1.25%. Of the current 1.15% mortality and expense risk charge, 0.30% is for the mortality risk assumed and 0.85% is
for the expense risk assumed.
9. MassMutual and MML Bay State will assume mortality risks under the Contracts by their contractual obligation to
make periodic payments in accordance with annuity rates and other Contract provisions regardless of how long an annuitant
might live. This obligation assures each annuitant that neither the annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement
in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the payments received under the Contracts.
10. MassMutual and MML Bay State will assume expense risks under the Contracts by their contractual obligation to
administer the Contracts even if the administrative charges are insufficient to cover the administrative expenses
associated with the Contracts.

11. An annual charge of 0.10% will be assessed against the assets of each Separate Account to reimburse MassMutual
and MML Bay State for bearing the risks associated with providing certain enhanced death benefits under the Contracts.
A death benefit is paid upon the death of either the Contract owner or the annuitant. If an owner and annuitant are the
same, the death benefit paid will be the annuitant death benefit.
If the Contract owner dies before the maturity date of the Contract, the beneficiary named in the Contract will receive
the cash redemption value of the Contract. If the annuitant dies before the maturity date of the Contract, the beneficiary
named in the Contract will receive the greater of two enhanced death benefits, depending on the Contract owner's state.
Under the first alternative, if the annuitant dies before the maturity date, the beneficiary named in the Contract
will receive the greater of: (a) The total of all purchase payments made to the Contract, less all partial redemptions,
accumulated at 5% to the annuitant's 75th birthday and 0% thereafter, but not more than two time purchase payments
less redemptions; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract less any applicable administrative charge (and any
sales charge, if the annuitant's age on the Contract date exceeds 75). 

The death benefit described above may not be available in certain states for annuitants whose issue age is less than
76. In those instances, the death benefit during the first three years will be equal to the greater of: (a) The total
of all purchase payments made to the Contract less all partial redemptions; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract
less any applicable administrative charge. During any subsequent three Contract year period, the death benefit
will be the greater of: (a) The death benefit on the last day of the previous three Contract year period plus any purchase
payments made less all partial redemptions since then; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract less any applicable
administrative charge. 

12. MassMutual and MML Bay State currently will permit a Contract owner to make up to 14 transfers among the divisions
of the Separate Accounts (and the Fixed Account if available) each Contract year without charge during the accumulation
period of the Contracts. Transfers in excess of 14 will result in the imposition of a $20 fee. MassMutual and MML Bay
State reserve the right to change the number of transfers that may be made without charge. The Contracts provide, however,
that the number of transfers that may be made without incurring a charge will be at least four per Contract year during
the accumulation period. Amounts applied under a variable payment option during the payout period may be transferred
once every 90 days. MassMutual and MML Bay State reserve the right to change transfer limitations. 

13. Premium taxes ranging up to 3.5% of purchase payments are imposed by certain municipalities and states. Under
current practice, MassMutual and MML Bay State will deduct amounts owned for premium taxes from a Contract's accumulated
value at annuitization, maturity, or full surrender. Both MassMutual and MML Bay State have reserved the right to
deduct amounts owned for premium taxes from premium payments.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) taken together are intended to provide for the protection of the assets of investment
companies that issue periodic payment plan certificates. Section 27(c)(2) of the Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic
payment plan certificate and any depositor or underwriter for such periodic payment plan certificate from selling
such certificates unless all proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than any sales load) are deposited
with a qualified bank acting as trustee or custodian, and held under an indenture or agreement containing specified
provisions. Section 26(a) of the Act requires that such indenture or custodian agreement must provide, among other
things that such bank shall not allow as an expense any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee,
not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally performed by the bank itself.
2. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge and the enhanced
death benefit charge from the assets of the Separate Accounts in connection with the issuance by MassMutual and MML
Bay State of the Contracts to the funded by the Separate Accounts. 
3. Applicants represent that the guaranteed mortality and expense risk charges of 1.25% are reasonable in relation
to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contract and are reasonable in amount as determined by
industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and
expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts issued by other insurance
companies. This representation is based on MassMutal's and MML Bay State's analysis of publicly available information
about such other contracts, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the manner in which
charges are imposed, guarantees of charge levels or annuity rates, and the markets in which the Contracts will be offered.
Applicants undertake to maintain at MassMutual's home office and MML Bay State's principal office and to make available
to the Commission (or its staff) upon request, memoranda setting forth in detail the products analyzed, the methodology
used, and the results of their respective comparative reviews.
4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charges under the Contracts may be insufficient to cover all costs
relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In such circumstances, the charges for mortality and expense risk
may be a source of the profit that would be available to pay MassMutual's and/or MML Bay State's distribution expenses
not reimbursed by applicable sales charges. MassMutual and MML Bay State have concluded that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing agreements benefit both the Separate Accounts and the Contract
owners. The basis for this conclusion is set forth in memoranda that will be maintained by MassMutal and MML Bay State
at their home office and principal office, respectively. These memoranda will be available to the Commission (or
its staff) upon request.
5. Applicants represent that the Separate Accounts will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to
have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section
2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.
6. Applicants assert that the mortality risk charge of 0.10% for the enhanced death benefits offered is reasonable
in relation to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contracts. In arriving at this determination,
MassMutual and MML Bay State conducted a large number of trials at various issue ages to determine the expected cost
of the enhanced death benefit. First, hypothetical asset returns were projected using generally accepted actuarial
simulation methods. For each asset return pattern thus generated, hypothetical accumulated values were calculated
by applying the projected asset returns to the initial value in a hypothetical account. Each accumulated value so
calculated was then compared to the amount of the enhanced death benefit payable in the event of the hypothetical Contract
owner's death during the year in question. By analyzing the results of several thousand such simulations, MassMutual
and MML Bay State were able to determine actuarily the level cost of providing the enhanced death benefit. Based on
this analysis, MassMutual and MML Bay State determined that a mortality risk charge of 0.10% was a reasonable charge
for providing the enhanced death benefit. Memoranda is available to the Commission (or its staff) upon request setting
forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the risk charge of 0.10% for the enhanced death benefit is
reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contracts.


Conclusion


Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,
or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit, for all of the reasons stated in the application, that their exemptive
requests meet the standards set out in Section 6(c), are well precedented, and that an Order should, therefore, be
granted.

New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting; Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces that a public meeting will be held on NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program and other vehicle safety
consumer information activities. The purpose of the meeting is to seek the public's guidance on how best to provide
vehicle safety information to consumers and to ascertain the types of information consumers desire.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1972, Congress enacted the ``Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act'' which includes, among other things,
requirements for the development and dissemination of comparative information on the crashworthiness of motor
vehicles. In 1978, the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) was created to partially fulfill this requirement. NCAP
test results evaluate the degree or crash protection provided front seat occupants by the vehicle's structure and
the occupant protection devices provided for those occupants. NCAP crash tests, through model year 1994, have evaluated
frontal crash protection only. In this test, vehicles are crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 mph, which is equivalent
to a head-on collision between two identical vehicles each moving at 35 mph. Instrumented dummies register forces
and impacts during the crash. That information is, in turn, used by NHTSA to predict potential head, chest and femur
injuries. Approximately 35-40 passenger vehicles are tested each year in the NCAP and the test results are made
available to the public through the periodic issuance of news releases, through the agency's Hotline, and through
other means.



NCAP is NHTSA's most popular vehicle safety consumer information activity, as witnessed by the volume of calls to
the agency, media attention to program results, and the use of NCAP data by numerous consumer and insurance organizations.

In recent years, the travelling public has increased its concern about motor vehicle safety. Increased safety belt
usage, reduced levels of alcohol-impaired driving, and attention to vehicle safety attributes such as air bags and
antilock brakes are evidence of this trend.

To take advantage of this heightened consumer awareness of safety, and to address technical and other issues associated
with NCAP, the agency believes it is timely to convene a Public Meeting to discuss future activities under NCAP as well
as how NCAP and other safety information activities conducted or required by NHTSA can best be integrated.



Report to Congress



On December 8, 1993, in response to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the agency submitted a report
to Congress on NCAP.

This report, which is in the docket, provides:

 The results of an 18-month study to assess consumer and media needs and preferences for better understanding
and more effective use of NCAP data. This included a summary of several consumer focus group and media studies. These
studies indicated that consumers and the media desire comparative safety information on vehicles, a simplified
NCAP format to better understand and utilize the crash test results, and expansion of NCAP to include other crash modes,
such as side crashes and rollovers. Plans for implementing the findings of these studies are included in that report.

 Studies of real-world crashes versus NCAP crash tests. These studies tentatively conclude that NCAP test
conditions approximate real-world crash conditions covering a major segment of the frontal crash safety problem.
NHTSA also tentatively concludes that there is a significant correlation between NCAP results and real-world fatality
risks for restrained drivers. In high speed frontal crashes, fatality risks to restrained drivers of cars that perform
well in NCAP may be as much as 30 percent lower than fatality risks to restrained drivers of cars that do not perform well
in NCAP. A more detailed report on this subject titled Correlation of NCAP Performance With Fatality Risk in Actual
Head-On Collisions has been published by the agency, and is available in the NHTSA docket, and public comments were
separately sought on that report (see 59 FR 1586, January 11, 1994).

 A study on the efficacy of allowing manufacturers to choose between the Hybrid III and the Hybrid II crash test
dummy. NCAP data were utilized in this study along with an analysis of comments to 

Federal Register

 notices on the mandatory use of the Hybrid III crash test dummy in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No.
208, Occupant Crash Protection, and in NCAP. From data analysis and the review of the comments to the notices, NHTSA
has concluded that exclusive use of the Hybrid III in NCAP should begin with MY 1996 vehicles. This is two years earlier
than the Hybrid III will be used exclusively for FMVSS No. 208 compliance tests. Beginning with MY 1994 vehicles, the
Hybrid III is being used exclusively for NCAP testing for all seating positions in which the occupant is protected
by an air bag.

The report also includes a review of NCAP historical performance and the following future goals:

 Reach a larger group of the population with simplified data that will assist consumers in their vehicle purchases.

 Expand the collection of safety information by utilizing the additional injury-measuring capabilities
of the more advanced Hybrid III dummy.

 Expand NCAP to provide comparative side impact information to consumers along with the frontal NCAP information.

 Monitor rollover safety activities to determine the potential for providing consumers with comparative
information on levels of protection in the rollover crash mode and on vehicle roll stability.



January 3, 1994 Request for Comments




NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on January 3, 1994, (59 FR 104), to request comments on whether it should convene a public meeting to review and discuss
issues of NCAP. Comments were solicited on:


(1) the desirability and need for such a public meeting and


(2) the topics for consideration if a meeting is conducted. Suggested topics included all items that were discussed
in the Congressional report and others, such as_

(A) additional frontal crash modes and/or higher frontal test speeds.

(B) additional injury measures.


(C) whether crashworthiness assessment programs should precede or follow the rulemaking process.

(D) review of the simplified NCAP format.



Response to January 3, 1994 Request for Comments



Comments were received from three automobile manufacturers (Toyota, Volkswagen (VW), and Volvo), two automobile
manufacturer associations (Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM), and the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA)), the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), and four consumer groups
(Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates), Center for Auto Safety (CFAS), Institute for Injury Reduction,
and Public Citizen).

All commenters supported the holding of a public meeting. Toyota opposed the expansion of NCAP, urging the agency
instead to provide consumers information on specific vehicle safety features. VW stated that NCAP expansion is premature
while Volvo said that vehicle safety is more complex than can be represented by single tests at a single speed, etc.
Conversely, Advocates, CFAS, and IIHS favor expansion of NCAP to other crash modes and speeds.

<DOCNO> FR940926-2-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940926-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The automobile industry generally felt that new NCAP activities, such as different test speeds, injury criteria,
or crash modes, should be preceded by rulemaking notices to amend existing or add new safety standards regulating
the same aspect of performance. However, Advocates argued that NCAP-type consumer information programs should
precede formal rulemaking.

Toyota and AAMA suggested that NCAP should consider using tests harmonized with those being conducted in the international
community.

In comments on the new ``star'' rating system, Toyota questioned the validity of combining head and chest dummy injury
readings into a single measure. VW stated that it found the new rating system more acceptable than the previous format.
IIHS has reservations over the new star system because it believes that consumers may not fully understand that it
can only be used to compare vehicles in the same weight class. CFAS stated that the system could be improved and should
also reflect femur loads.

Several comments were provided on using additional or different injury criteria. Toyota and VW stated that the biofidelity
of additional injury levels has not been established. IIHS said NHTSA needs to reassess its current NCAP injury criteria,
given the widespread use of air bags. CFAS suggested using the additional injury-predicting capability of the Hybrid
III test dummy.

CFAS also suggested that NHTSA publish make/model Fatal Accident Reporting System data and consider providing consumer
information on window stickers. They also suggested that NHTSA define the audience for NCAP data.

VW urged NHTSA to address test repeatability and variability and the potential increase in vehicle aggressiveness
if test speeds are raised.



Public Meeting



The agency has reviewed the public comments to its January 3, 1994, notice and, in response to the commenters, has decided
to conduct a public meeting on the future of NCAP. However, NHTSA wishes to expand the discussion to include other vehicle
safety consumer information activities. In particular, NHTSA points to CFAS' suggestion that the agency provide
point-of-sale safety information via vehicle stickers. This is the same approach the agency itself proposed for
NCAP frontal crash information (see 46 FR 7025, January 22, 1981) and in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for rollover
stability information published on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33254). The agency recognizes that window stickers, or other
types of pre- or actual point-of-sale informaiton (such as consumer brochures) are the most effective means of reaching
prospective vehicle purchasers, but that significant issues, such as the necessity of providing information on
the limitations and use of the data, remain. The agency also wishes to point out that it may not need to continue to conduct
NCAP activities, if point-of-sale information is provided. NHTSA wishes to focus public attention on this issue,
which will be part of the discussion at the public meeting. However, not wishing to pre-judge the issue, the agency
wishes to conduct the majority of the public meeting as if its NCAP activities will continue.

The agency wishes the public meeting to have the maximum possible level of participation. Thus, it will conduct the
meeting using such informal means as follow-up questions from attendees to formal presenters, as well as having panel
discussions of some issues.

To focus attention, NHTSA has prepared the attached agenda for the meeting. Agency staff will make presentations
regarding items I (Introduction) and II (Background of NCAP) to set the format of, and stage for, the meeting. Agency
staff will summarize the recent ``real world'' evaluation of NCAP (Agenda item III_Relevance of NCAP Data). NHTSA
invites commenters to make presentations on the validity of that report. NHTSA staff will respond and ask questions
of those making presentations.

Item IV, Reactions to NCAP information, will be in the form 
of a panel discussion. Those wishing to serve on the panel are 
requested to notify the agency. NHTSA will seek to insure 
balanced representation from those desiring to serve on the 
panel.



Item V, Methods of Presenting NCAP Information, will use the 
speaker format, while Item VI, Current Test Procedure Issues, 
will again be in a panel format.



NHTSA desires that Item VII, the Future of Consumer Safety 
Information Initiatives have the largest time for discussion of 
any item on the agenda. Again, the agency believes a panel 
discussion would be most appropriate for this item. 





Written Comments





The agency invites written comments from 
all interested parties. The agency notes that participation in 
the public meeting is not a prerequisite for the submission of 
written comments. It is requested but not required that 10 copies of each written comment be submitted. 


No comment may exceed 15 pages in length. (40 CFR 553.21). 
Necessary attachments may be appended to a comment without regard 
to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage 
commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise 
fashion. 



If a commenter wishes to submit specified information under 
a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete 
submission, including purportedly confidential business 
information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at 
the street address given above, and seven copies from which the 
purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be 
submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality 
should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the 
information specified in the agency's confidential business 
information regulation, 49 CFR Part 512. 



All comments received before the close of business on the 
comment closing date indicated above will be considered, and will 
be available for examination in the docket at the above address 
both before and after that date. Comments will be available for 
inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant 
information as it becomes available in the docket after the 
closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons 
continue to examine the docket for new material. 



Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their 
written comments in the Docket Section should enclose, in the 
envelope with their comments, a self-addressed stamped postcard. 
Upon receipt, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. 



Persons making oral presentations at the public meeting are 



 requested, but not required, to submit 25 written copies of the 
full text of their presentation to Vincent Quarles no later than 
the day before the meeting. Presentations should be limited to 
15 minutes. If time permits, persons who have not requested 
time, but would like to make a statement, will be afforded an 
opportunity to do so. Copies of all written statements will be 
placed in the docket for this notice. A verbatim transcript of 
the public meeting will be prepared and also placed in the NHTSA 
docket as soon as possible after the meeting. A schedule of the 
persons making oral presentations at the meeting will be 
available at the designated meeting area at the beginning of the 
public meeting. 



To facilitate communication, NHTSA will provide auxiliary
 aids to participants as necessary, during the meeting. Thus, any 
person desiring assistance of ``auxiliary aids'' (e.g., sign-
language interpreter, telecommunications, devices for deaf 
persons (TDDs) readers, taped texts, braille materials, or large 
print materials and/or a magnifying device) should contract 
Vincent Quarles at (202) 366-1708 by October 26, 1994.

Agenda



I. Introduction



A NHTSA representative will introduce the meeting and discuss its purpose. This will include a review of the Federal
Register notice on January 3, 1994, and a brief summary of the comments received. The format of the meeting will be outlined.
Proposed panel discussions and presentations involving both NHTSA and public participants will be announced.



II. Background of NCAP



An agency speaker will briefly discuss the background of NCAP including the statutory mandate, early efforts, a brief
history of NCAP, the current program criteria, procedures and protocol and Congressional interest.



III. Relevance of NCAP Data



The agency will make presentations and discuss its recent report showing the correlation between real-world crashes
and NCAP results. The agency will also discuss comments on that report.



IV. Reactions to NCAP Information



This subject will be addressed by a panel of representatives of manufacturers, media, insurers and automobile safety
and consumer groups. The discussion of this and all other participant panels will be moderated by an agency representative.



V. Methods of presenting and format of NCAP Information



An agency speaker will present an historical overview of the methods used to present previous NCAP data and discuss
the current star rating system. In addition, the agency will discuss the possibility of combining data from various
crash modes into a single injury indicator. Outside speakers are invited to present their views, reactions and suggested
revisions to the present format.



VI. Current Test Procedure Issues



This subject will be addressed by a panel of representatives of manufacturers, media, insurers and automobile safety
and consumer groups. Topics will include issues such as repeatability, international harmonization and aggressivity.



VII. Future of Consumer Safety Information Initiatives 



The agency will moderate a discussion of possible future changes in NCAP and its other consumer safety information
initiatives. Proposed topics include; evaluating the need to change NCAP, consideration of higher test speeds,
side impacts, offset crashes, different size dummies and/or developing new injury criteria. The agency will also
entertain discussion of the feasibility of mandating the provision, by manufacturers, of comprehensive safety
information on new models. The objective of providing such information would be to inform consumers (via one label
or through other means) of important vehicle safety attributes such as protection in frontal impacts, side impacts
and rollovers. It should also be noted that in 1981 the agency proposed establishment of an NCAP performance rating
program to be developed by manufacturers via a window sticker.

<DOCTITLE>AM General Corporation, Mootness of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>




AM General Corporation of Livonia, Michigan determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply with Paragraph
S5.3.1.1 of 49 CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated
Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573 ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports''. AM
General also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance was inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety.

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 13, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 17635).
The reader is referred to the notice for further information. No comments were received. This notice announces NHTSA's
determination that the petition has been mooted.

The noncompliance reported was with the photometric requirements for a single test point on rear identification
lamps. Representatives of NHTSA contacted the petitioner to verify that a noncompliance existed, and learned that
the petition had been based on petitioner's assumption that a noncompliance existed because a small portion of the
lamp was obscured. Petitioner then performed photometric tests on the lamps and found that their light output exceeded
the minimum requirements by 100% at the test points concerned. Because the lamps do, in fact, comply, petitioner is
under no legal obligation to notify and remedy a noncompliance and its petition is moot.

<DOCTITLE>Child Restraint Systems Manufactured by Fisher-Price, Inc.; Public Proceeding Scheduled</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NHTSA will hold a public meeting at 10 a.m. on October 21, 1994 regarding its initial decision that certain child restraint
systems manufactured by Fisher-Price, Inc., fail to comply with the flammability requirements of Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, 

Child Restraint Systems.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a) (formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1412(a)), NHTSA has made an initial decision that certain child safety seats manufactured by
Fisher-Price, Inc., do not comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213,
Child Restraint Systems, 49 CFR 571.213. Compliance tests performed for NHTSA indicate that the shoulder belt webbing
on Fisher-Price Models AO9191, DO9191, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 seats manufactured between 1988 and September
16, 1993 do not meet the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 and therefore would not provide adequate protection
to children in the event of a fire in a vehicle in which they are installed.




Pursuant to 49 CFR 554.10, a public meeting will be held at 10 a.m., on Monday, October 21, 1994 in Room 9230, Department
of Transportation Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, at which time the manufacturer and all other
interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments on the issue of whether the
child safety seats covered by this initial decision comply with FMVSS No. 213.

In September 1993, Fisher-Price filed a petition seeking an exemption from the recall requirements of the statute
on the basis that any noncompliance with the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 was inconsequential as it
relates to motor vehicle safety (58 FR 59511). After NHTSA denied the petition (59 FR 23253), Fisher-Price appealed
(59 FR 30957). In conjunction with its appeal, Fisher-Price requested the agency to convene a public meeting on the
inconsequentiality issue, which was scheduled for August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015).

Pursuant to the agency's regulations governing inconsequentiality petitions, 49 CFR 556.4(a), such petitions
may only be filed after a determination that a noncompliance exists. Until recently, NHTSA had believed that Fisher-Price
had made such a determination in September 1993, prior to filing its inconsequentiality petition. However, on August
10, 1994, Fisher-Price informed the agency that it was taking the position that it had never formally determined that
a noncompliance existed. NHTSA therefore canceled the public meeting and terminated the inconsequentiality proceeding
(59 FR 42326). The documents reflecting the agency's consideration of that petition may be found in NHTSA Docket No.
93-79.

Under the circumstances, NHTSA has resumed its noncompliance investigation and, as described above, has made an
initial decision that these Fisher-Price car seats do not comply with FMVSS No. 213. Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), Fisher-Price
could at this time renew its petition for an inconsequentiality determination. However, by letter dated August 25,
1994, counsel for Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that the company did not plan to file such a petition, even if the agency
should finally decide that a noncompliance exists.

Interested persons are invited to participate in this proceeding through written an/or oral presentations. Persons
wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Elaine Beale, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 6111, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202)
366-2832, before the close of business on October 18, 1994. Written comments must be submitted to the same address
