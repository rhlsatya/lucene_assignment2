Background 


In accordance with section 103B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 crop of upland cotton
if it is determined that the total supply of upland cotton, in the absence of an ARP, will be excessive, taking into account
the need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency.

Land diversion payments also may be made to producers of upland cotton, whether or not an ARP for upland cotton is in
effect, if needed to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of upland cotton to desirable goals. If, at the
time of final announcement of the ARP, the projected carry-over of upland cotton for the crop year is equal to or greater
than 8 million bales, a paid land diversion shall be offered to upland cotton producers. A paid land diversion has not
been considered because, given the existing supply/use situation, it is not needed. 
If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 25 percent)
to the upland cotton crop acreage base for the crop for each upland cotton-producing farm. In making such a determination,
the number of acres placed into the program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985,
as amended, must be taken into consideration. 
A number of acres on the farm shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.
The acres required to be devoted to conservation uses may be reduced, at the request of the producer, if the producer's
total estimated deficiency payments which would be received under the feed grain, rice, wheat, upland and ELS cotton
programs are estimated to be reduced in order to comply with the payment limitations set forth in section 1001 of the
Food Security Act of 1985. The amount of the reduction in the acres required to be devoted to conservation uses is proportional
to the estimated reduction in payments, in accordance with 7 CFR 1413.53. 
Producers who knowingly produce upland cotton in excess of the permitted upland cotton acreage for the farm plus any
upland cotton acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for upland cotton loans
and payments with respect to that farm. 
If it is determined that an ARP for the 1995 crop of upland cotton is needed, a preliminary announcement of the ARP uniform
percentage requirement (from 0 to 
25 percent) must be made not later than November 1 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the crop is harvested.
Not later than January 1 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested, a final announcement of the ARP uniform
percentage requirement must be made. Producers in early planting areas may elect to participate in the program on
the terms of the ARP first announced for the crop, or as subsequently revised, if the Secretary determines that the
producers may be unfairly disadvantaged by the revision. The ARP for the 1995 crop of upland cotton must be set at a level
that will result in a ratio of carry-over to total disappearance of 
29.5 percent, based on the most recent projection of carry-over and total disappearance at the time of announcement
of the ARP. For the purposes of this provision, the term ``total disappearance'' means all upland cotton utilization,
including total domestic, total export, and total residual disappearance. 
Based on August 1994 supply/use estimates, ending stocks for the 1995 marketing year under a 5-percent ARP, a 10-percent
ARP, and a 15-percent ARP are 
5.35 million bales, 5.10 million bales, and 4.75 million bales, respectively. Such ARP levels would result in ratios
of carry-over to total disappearance of 30.6, 29.7, and 28.1 percent, respectively. For the purposes of this proposed
rule, these three ARP options will be considered. However, because of changes in the supply/use situation that may
develop between now and November 1, the actual announced preliminary ARP may be different from the options discussed
in this rule. 
The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in the following table.

Reexamination of the NRC Enforcement Policy 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is expanding its reexamination of its enforcement program to include the
issue of Notices of Enforcement Discretion for operating power reactors and requests public comment on issues associated
with that matter. The NRC is soliciting comments from interested public interest groups, the regulated industry,
states, and concerned citizens. This request is intended to assist the NRC in a review of its enforcement program which
is being conducted to make recommendations for improvements in the regulatory process.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 23, 1994 (59 FR 43298)
, the Review Team for the Reexamination of the NRC Enforcement Program issued a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing a reexamination of the NRC enforcement program and requesting comments on the enforcement program.
The comment period will close for that notice on October 24, 1994. Comments for this notice should also be submitted
by October 24, 1994.





The purpose of this review effort is to (i) Perform an assessment of the NRC's enforcement program to determine whether
the defined purposes of the enforcement program are appropriate, (ii) determine whether the NRC's enforcement practices
and procedures for issuing enforcement actions are consistent with those purposes, and (iii) provide recommendations
on any changes the Review Team believes advisable. It is expected that the Review Team will complete its review and
issue its report, including recommendations, by the end of January 1995. 

In the August 23, 1994 notice comments were requested on a variety of matters associated with the enforcement program.
Item G. of the notice, entitled ``Exercise of Discretion,'' raised two issues associated with the exercise of enforcement
discretion. However, a note was included under Item G. that provided that the enforcement review was not addressing
section VII.C. of the Enforcement Policy entitled, ``Exercise of Discretion for an Operating Reactor'' that addresses
``Notices of Enforcement Discretion'' (NOEDs). 59 FR 43303. The Review Team has since reconsidered its position
and concluded that this issue should be considered as part of the reexamination. Comments are now requested on this
issue as described below. 

On September 12, 1994, a report entitled, ``Notice of Enforcement Discretion Review Team Report,'' was issued which
addressed a number of issues associated with the issuances of NOEDs. The recommendations in this report have not yet
been adopted by the NRC. The report and its recommendations are undergoing staff review. A copy of that report is available
for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Document Room. In addition it is available on the NRC bulletin
board system (BBS) that is a subsystem of FedWorld. Access to the NRC BBS is described in the 

ADDRESSES

 section above. 

In providing comments on the issue addressed below, please key comments to the numbering system used to identify the
specific issues by providing the issue number before the particular comment (e.g., Response to K.1). General or anecdotal
comments (such as a general comment to the effect that some enforcement conferences have not been effective or that
some enforcement cases have been inconsistent with the Enforcement Policy) will not be particularly useful. Rather
comments should be as specific as possible and should reference specific cases, as appropriate, so that the Review
Team can understand and evaluate the comment. Responses which call for a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer should be accompanied
with an explanation as to why the commenter agrees or disagrees with the issue. When the term licensee is used in the
issues listed below, it refers, as applicable, to licensees, vendors, and other persons subject to NRC enforcement
actions. 

Comments may be provided in hard copy or through the NRC electronic bulletin board (BBS). Instructions for accessing
the NRC BBS are provided in the 

ADDRESSES

 section above. 

Comments are requested on the following specific issues:

K. Exercise of Enforcement Discretion for Operating Reactors


The NRC requires that a licensee operate its facility in compliance with the NRC's regulations and the specific facility's
license. When a licensee fails to comply with the conditions of its license or the NRC's regulations, the staff normally
takes enforcement action against that licensee in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy. Section VII.C of the
Enforcement Policy, 10 CFR part 2, appendix C, recognizes that on occasion circumstances may arise where a power reactor
licensee's compliance with a technical specification limiting condition for operation or with other license conditions
would involve an unnecessary plant transient or performance of testing, inspection, or system realignment that
is inappropriate with the specific plant conditions, or unnecessary delays in start up without any corresponding
health and safety benefits. In these circumstances it may be appropriate not to enforce the applicable requirements
provided that the NRC is clearly satisfied that the action is consistent with protecting the public health and safety.
Before issuing a NOED to a licensee, the licensee must justify the safety basis for the request and provide whatever
information NRC deems necessary in making a decision as to whether to exercise this discretion. NOEDs are infrequently
used and when issued are placed in the NRC Public Document Room. The use of enforcement discretion does not change the
fact that a violation of a license requirement occurred. Under the Enforcement Policy, the NRC staff is to take enforcement
action when it determines that there is an underlying violation that caused the need to seek the issuance of the NOED.
1. Under what circumstances should this type of enforcement discretion be exercised and why?
In addition to the above specific issues and those raised in the August 23, 1994 notice, commenters are invited to provide
any other views on the NRC enforcement program which may assist the NRC in improving the effectiveness of NRC enforcement
efforts.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon
Corporate Jets Model Hawker 800 and 1000 and Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125 series airplanes. This proposal would require
inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay jack pivots of the main landing gear, and replacement of the sidestay
jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. This proposal is prompted by a report of fracturing of a jack pivot, which
resulted in the inability of the main landing gear to deploy. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent a wheels-up landing.

Discussion


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model Hawker 800 and 1000 and Model DH/BH/HS/BAe
125 series airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received a report of fracturing of a jack pivot, which resulted in
the inability of the main landing gear (MLG) to deploy. The cracks are apparently caused by metal fatigue. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in a wheels-up landing.
Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB 32-233, dated June 24, 1994, which describes procedures
for repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay jack pivots of the MLG, and replacement of the sidestay
jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure
the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay
jack pivots of the MLG, and replacement of the sidestay jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
The referenced service bulletin recommends completion of the initial inspection within 28 days after the issuance
date of the service bulletin. However, the manufacturer has notified the FAA that there is a delay in the availability
of replacement parts for the sidestay jack pivot assemblies. The FAA has determined that a compliance time for the
initial inspection within 28 days after the effective date of the final rule for this action will allow adequate time
for the manufacturer to provide the replacement parts and for operators to comply with the requirements of this AD.
The FAA estimates that 550 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The
FAA has been advised that the manufacturer plans to provide the required parts at no cost to the operators. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $181,500, or $330 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC-8 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect corrosion on areas of the airplane
structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repair, if necessary; and replacement of black insulation
blankets with certain aluminized (silver) insulation. This proposal is prompted by reports of corrosion forming
on areas of the airplane structure where the black film covers the thermal insulation blankets. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capability of the airplane fuselage and sudden
loss of cabin pressure due to corrosion of the airplane fuselage structure.

Discussion 


Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, 
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain de Havilland 
Model DHC-8-100 and -300 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises that 
there have been reports of corrosion forming on areas of the airplane structure where 
black Orcon film covers the thermal insulation blankets. Investigation revealed that the 
black Orcon film used to insulate the forward fuselage, passenger compartment, flight 
compartment, and ventilation ducts contains carbon. The cause of this corrosion has been 
attributed to the formation of condensation on any aluminum airplane structure when it is 
in contact with the carbon in the black Orcon film. Such corrosion, if not detected and 
corrected in a timely manner, could result in degradation of the strength of the airplane 
fuselage structure and could lead to sudden loss of cabin pressure. 
Bombardier, Inc. (formerly de Havilland) has issued Service Bulletins 
S.B. 8-25-89, Revision D; S.B. 8-25-90, Revision B; S.B. 8-25-91, Revision C;
S.B. 8-25-92, Revision D; and S. B. 8-25-93, Revision B; all dated January 19, 1994. These 
service bulletins describe procedures for one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion on 
areas of the airplane structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repaired, if 
necessary. The service bulletins also describe procedures for replacement of black Orcon 
film insulation blankets with AN4C aluminized (silver) film thermal insulation blankets 
in various areas of the airplane structure. Transport Canada Aviation classified these 
service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF-94-08, 
dated April 26, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in 
Canada. 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada 
Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has 
reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for 
products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would require a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion on areas of the airplane 
structure where black film thermal insulation is used, and repaired, if necessary. This 
proposed AD also would require replacement of black Orcon film thermal insulation 
blankets with AN4C aluminized (silver) film insulation blankets. The actions would be 
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described 
previously. 

The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would require approximately 650 work hours to accomplish the 
required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. The FAA has been 
advised that the manufacturer plans to provide required parts and to accomplish the 
required modification at no expense to operators. Therefore, there is no cost impact on 
U.S. operators that is associated with this proposed rule with regard to labor charges or 
parts costs. 

The FAA does recognize, however, that while operators may incur administrative 
costs associated with compliance to this proposed rule, the one-year compliance time 
specified in paragraph (a) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the proposed 
requirements to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection 
and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane 
scheduling. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

Availability of NPRM's 


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-220, 800 Independence Avenue,
SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure. 


The Proposal 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to extend Colored
Federal Airways G-10, R-99, and realign Colored Federal Airway B-37 as a result of the decommissioning
of the Cape Spencer Marine NDB. Colored Federal Airways G-10 and R-99 would be extended and would include
an extension of G-10 from Woody Island to Kachemak. King Salmon, AK, NDB was inadvertently used in the descriptions
of Colored Federal Airways G-8 and G-12, and as a result of this proposal, Saldo, AK, NDB would replace King
Salmon, AK, NDB. King Salmon, AK, Locator Outer Marker in the description of B-27 would be replaced with Saldo,
AK, NDB. Finally, as a result of the Quinhagak, AK, VOR/DME being decommissioned, this action would remove that segment
of V-308 between Quinhagak, AK, and Bethel, AK, and would realign V-328 as a direct route between Dillingham,
AK, and Kipnuk, AK. Colored Federal airways are published in paragraphs 6009(a), 6009(b), and 6009(d) respectively,
and Alaskan VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(b), of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Colored Federal airways and the Alaskan
VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

I. Background on the Oklahoma Program


On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program. General background
information on the Oklahoma program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Oklahoma program can be found in the January 19, 1981, 

Federal Register 

(46 FR 4902). Subsequent actions concerning Oklahoma's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 936.15,
936.16, and 936.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated February 17, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. OK-959.01). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendments
at 30 CFR 936.16 (a) through (i). Oklahoma proposed to amend the Bond Release Guidelines that are referenced in subsections
816.116(a) and 817.116(a) of the Oklahoma rules.
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 8, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 10770), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK-959.06). Because no one requested a public hearing or
meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on April 7, 1994.
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns with Oklahoma's proposed revisions to the Bond Release
Guidelines. OSM notified Oklahoma of these concerns by letter dated May 20, 1994 (administrative record No. OK_959.10).
Oklahoma responded in a letter dated July 21, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory
information (administrative record No. OK-959.11).
OSM announced receipt of the July 21, 1994, revisions to the proposed amendment in the August 9, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 40505) and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK-959.16). The public
comment period closed on August 24, 1994.
By letter dated September 2, 1994 (administrative record No. OK-959.19), Oklahoma, at its own initiative in
response to the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, Oklahoma State Office (SCS), August 29, 1994, comment letter (administrative
record No. OK-959.18), submitted a revised amendment. Oklahoma proposes revisions to the Bond Release Guidelines
in Appendices A, F, and O, concerning, respectively, the definition of ``productivity,'' the method of sampling
for production on pastureland and grazingland, and the methods for calculating a technical standard for productivity
on lands reclaimed for use as pastureland and grazingland.
Specifically, Oklahoma proposes to revise the definition of ``productivity'' to refer to the amount of total, rather
than harvestable, biomass. Also, with respect to the method of production sampling, Oklahoma proposes to (1) recommend
that pastureland or grazingland with a predominance of warm season species be clipped during September or October
and cool season species be clipped during May or June and (2) require that vegetation be clipped to ground level rather
than within approximately two inches of ground level. Lastly, with respect to the calculation of technical standards,
Oklahoma proposes (1) to require for pastureland that SCS soil productivity figures expressed in animal unit months
(AUM's) be converted to pounds per acre by multiplying the AUM's by 1560 and (2) to clarify for grazingland that clipping
for productivity is a direct comparison to the SCS soil productivity figures expressed in pounds per acre.

OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Oklahoma
program.
Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Tulsa Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon conterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Oklahoma proposes to recodify its rules according to the standards set forth by the Oklahoma State Legislature and
the Office of Administrative Code. The proposed recodification revises the Oklahoma rules from series 816 for surface
coal mining operations and series 817 for underground coal mining operations to series 460 with underlying chapters
and subchapters specifying the various surface and underground coal mining provisions.

In addition, Oklahoma proposes to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at   780.25 and 784.16,
reclamation plan for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments;  780.37, road systems;  784.20,
subsidence control plans;  784.24, transportation facilities; section 800.40, requirement to release performance
bonds;   816.46 and 817.46, hydrologic balance and siltation structures;  816.116, revegetation
success standards;  816.121, subsidence control;  823.12, prime farmland soil removal;  823.13,
prime farmland soil stockpiling; and  823.14, prime farmland soil replacement.

More specifically, Oklahoma proposes the following revisions. It proposes to revise   780.25 and 784.16,
regarding the reclamation plan requirements for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments, by deleting
language allowing professional geologists and qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans
and detailed designs. In addition, Oklahoma proposes in both provisions to replace the phrase ``regulatory authority'
with the term ``Department.''

Oklahoma proposes to revise  780.37, regarding road systems, by deleting language allowing qualified, registered
professional land surveyors to certify plans and drawings for primary roads.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  784.20, regarding subsidence control plans, by removing the phrase ``to the extent
required under State law'' from the requirement that a permit application include a subsidence control plan containing
a description of the measures to be taken to mitigate or remedy any subsidence-related material to, or diminution
in value or reasonable foreseeable use of structures or facilities.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  784.24, regarding transportation facilities, by deleting language allowing
qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans and drawings for primary roads.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  800.40, regarding the requirement to release performance bonds, by providing
that the Department may arrange with the permittee to allow access to the permit area upon request by any person with
an interest in bond release, for the purpose of gathering information relevant to the proceeding.

Oklahoma proposes to revise   816.46 and 817.46, regarding the hydrologic balance requirements for
siltation structures, by (1) striking a cross-reference to provisions that grant authority to qualified, registered
professional land surveyors to certify plans and detailed designs for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments;
and (2) adding language to require that the qualified, registered professional engineer or land surveyor certifying
the construction of siltation structures shall have experience in pond construction.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  816.116, regarding revegetation success standards, to require that prior to
approving selective husbandry practices, the Department must obtain the approval of the Director of the Office of
Surface Mining that such practices are normal husbandry practices.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  816.121, regarding subsidence control, by deleting the phrase ``to the extent
required under applicable provisions of State law'' from the requirement to correct material damage resulting from
subsidence.

Oklahoma proposes to revise  823.12, regarding soil stockpiling requirements for prime farmland, to include
the E horizon in the description of topsoil for prime farmland. In addition, Oklahoma proposes to delete the phrase
``an equal or'' from the requirement that a final soil have a greater productive capacity than that which existed prior
to mining.

1. Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES 

or at locations other than the Tulsa Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.


 2. Public Hearing


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

by 4:00 p.m., c.d.t., on October 12, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.


3. Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under

IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated September 14, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. OK-964). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The SOAP provisions of
the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations that Oklahoma proposes to revise are: Section 795.6, eligibility for assistance;
Part 795.9, program services and data requirements; and  795.12, applicant liability.

Specifically, Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to an applicant's eligibility for SOAP assistance
at  795.6(a)(2) by requiring the applicant to establish that the probably total actual and attributed production
from all locations during any consecutive 12-month period either during the term of the permit or during the first
5 years after issuance of the permit, whichever period is shorter, will not exceed 300,000 tons and at  795.6(a)(2)(iv)
to require that attributed production will include all coal produced by operations owned by members of the applicant's
family and the applicant's relatives, unless it is established that there is no direct or indirect business relationship
between or among them.

Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to the kinds of data collected and the results furnished to the SOAP
program administrator at (1) Section 795.9(b)(2) to include the geologic drilling and the statement of the results
of test borings or core samplings for the proposed permit area; (2) Section 795.9(b)(3) to include the collection
of archeological information required by section 779.12(b) and any other archeological and historical information
required by the regulatory authority, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby; (3) Section 795.9(b)(4)
to include the collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement plans
for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values required by the regulatory authority under  780.16
and any other applicable regulations; (4) Section 795.9(3)(5) to include pre-blast surveys if requested under  816.62(b);
and (5) Section 795.9(3)(6) to include the development of cross-section maps and plans required under  779.25.

Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to the applicant's liability at   795.12(a) (2) and
(3) to provide that the applicant shall reimburse the Department of Mines (Department) for the cost of SOAP laboratory
services performed pursuant to Part 795 if the program administrator finds that the applicant's actual and attributed
annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during any consecutive 12-month period either during
the term of the permit for which assistance is provided or during the first 5 years after issuance of the permit, whichever
period is shorter, or if the permit is sold, transferred, or assigned to another person and the transferee's total
annual and attributed production exceeds the 300,000-ton annual production limit during any consecutive 12-month
period of the remaining term of the permit.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
