NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION









Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE),
is issuing a regulation for employees of NASA that supplements the executive branch-wide Standards of Ethical Conduct
(Standards) issued by OGE and codified at 5 CFR part 2635. NASA is also repealing those sections of its existing standards
of conduct regulations that are now superseded by the new Standards and by the executive branch financial disclosure
regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, also issued by OGE, and is adding a cross-reference to the current provisions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the
Executive Branch that are now codified at 5 CFR part 2635. See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and
52583, with an additional grace period extension at 59 FR 4779-4780. The Standards became effective February
3, 1993, and established uniform ethical conduct standards applicable to all executive branch personnel.
With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive branch agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental
regulations that are necessary to properly implement their respective ethics programs. NASA, with OGE's concurrence,
has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in new chapter LIX of 5 CFR, are necessary
for successful implementation of NASA's ethics program, in light of NASA's unique programs and operations.


II. Analysis of the Regulations


Section 6901.101 General


Section 6901.101 explains that the regulations apply to NASA employees and supplement the Standards at 5 CFR part
2635.


Section 6901.102 Designation of Responsible Officials


Although some sections of NASA's existing rules at 14 CFR part 1207 have been temporarily ``grandfathered'' by the
new OGE Standards, and others were not affected, 14 CFR part 1207 will eventually be totally superseded by a combination
of the new Standards, the new financial disclosure regulation, the NASA supplemental regulation, NASA internal
directives, and a future OGE regulation on regulatory waivers issued under 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(2). Therefore, the designation
of NASA Agency Ethics Officials currently at 14 CFR 1207.104 is being modified to include and identify ``Agency designees''
and is restated at section 6901.102 of the NASA supplemental regulation.


Section 6901.103 Outside Employment


5 CFR 2635.802 and 2635.803, respectively, authorize individual agencies, by supplemental regulation, to prohibit
conflicting outside employment and to require employees to obtain approval before engaging in other outside employment
or activities. The current NASA rules prohibiting outside employment with certain entities and requiring administrative
approval for other particular employment activities have been in effect for many years and have served NASA well in
avoiding violations of the standards of conduct and conflict of interest statutes and, thus, in ensuring public confidence
in the integrity of NASA personnel and programs. Accordingly, the rules at 14 CFR 1207.300-1207.306 have been
modified form as  6901.103 of the NASA supplemental regulation.

<PARENT> FR940928-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As permitted by 5 CFR 2635.802, NASA is issuing  6901.103(c) which sets forth prohibitions on non-Government
employment that are substantially similar to those found in 14 CFR 1207.302(f). Prohibited employment listed in
 6901.103(c) includes employment with a NASA contractor, subcontractor, or grantee, in connection with work
performed by that entity for NASA, and employment with parties to certain classes of agreements to which NASA is a party,
if the employment would be in connection with work to be performed under such an agreement. NASA has determined, in
accordance with the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.403(a), that such outside employment by employees, other than
special Government employees, would cause reasonable persons to question the impartiality and objectivity with
which NASA programs are administered.
As permitted by 5 CFR 2635.803, and based on its finding that the long-standing requirements for prior approval for
certain categories of outside employment at 14 CFR 1207.306 has helped to ensure that employees' outside activities
conform to applicable statutes and regulations, NASA has determined to continue to require prior approval for those
outside employment activities that, by their nature, tend to raise questions under the Standards. Before engaging
in specified categories of outside employment, with or without compensation,  6901.103(d) requires a NASA
employee, other than a special Government employee, to obtain written approval from an appropriate agency official.
``Outside Employment'' is broadly defined at  6901.103(b)(2) to cover any form of non-Federal employment
or business relationship involving the provision of personal services, including writing when done under an arrangement
with another person for production or publication of the written product. It does not, however, include participation
in the activities of nonprofit charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, and similar organizations,
unless the organization is a prohibited source as defined in 5 CFR 2635.203(d), or unless such activities involve
the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation other than reimbursement for expenses.
Sections 6901.103(f) and (g) set forth the requirements for submission and processing of a written request for approval.
To ensure that section 6901.103 is not itself construed as authority to deny permission to engage in any outside employment
activity,  6901.103(g)(3) states that approval will be granted unless it is determined that the prospective
outside employment is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR
part 2635 and this supplemental regulation.


III. Repeal of NASA Standards of Conduct


Most of NASA's standards of conduct at 14 CFR part 1207 were superseded by the executive branch-wide financial disclosure
regulations at 5 CFR part 2634 and by the ethical conduct standards at 5 CFR part 2635. NASA is, therefore, repealing
those portions of its existing standards of conduct regulation at 14 CFR part 1207 which were superseded by 5 CFR parts
2634 and 2635 or which will be superseded on the date of the current rulemaking by this NASA supplemental regulation.
In the place of the superseded regulations, NASA is substituting cross-references to the new executive branch-wide
regulations on ethical conduct and financial disclosure, the Office of Personnel Management provisions on employee
responsibilities and conduct at 5 CFR part 735, and the NASA supplemental regulation. Consistent with 5 CFR 2635.402(d)(1),
existing  1207.403 of 14 CFR is being preserved and redesignated as  1207.102, pending issuance by OGE
of superseding regulatory waivers. Similarly, existing sections 1207.800 and 1207.801 of 14 CFR, which provide
guidance to former NASA employees who desire to communicate with NASA to provide scientific or technical information
in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 207(j)(5), have no counterpart in the new Standards and are being retained and redesignated,
with a couple of modifications to reflect the current post-Government employment law, as   1207.201
and 1207.202 of 14 CFR.


IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure


Administrative Procedure Act


As Administrator of NASA, I have found that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)(3) for waiving, as unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking and the 30-day delay in effectiveness
as to these rules and repeals. The supplemental regulations are essentially similar to rules previously contained
in NASA's standards of conduct, and I believe that it is important to a smooth transition from NASA's prior ethics rules
to the new executive branch-wide Standards and financial disclosure regulations that these rulemaking actions
take place as soon as possible. Furthermore, this rulemaking is related to NASA's organization, procedures, and
practices.


Executive Order 12866


In promulgating this final rule, NASA has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulation
set forth in Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. This regulation has been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that Executive order.


Regulatory Flexibility Act

As Administrator of NASA, I have determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this regulation
will not have a significant impact on small business entities because it affects only NASA employees.



Paperwork Reduction Act



As Administrator of NASA, I have determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply
because this regulation does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the
Office of Management and Budget.

Apricots: Grade Standards


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises the United States Standards for Grades of Apricots. The revision specifies definitions that
do not appear in the standard but are described in the inspection instructions and brings up to date any obsolete terms
and definitions. In addition, the revision will provide metric equivalents for dimensions given in terms of U.S.
Customary units and contains conforming and editorial changes.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866 review. 


Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule for the revision of U.S. Standards for Grades
of Apricots will not impose substantial direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small
entities, and will not alter the market share or competitive position of these entities relative to large businesses.
In addition, under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, the use of these standards is voluntary. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
Agencies periodically review existing regulations. An objective of the review is to ensure that the grade standards
are serving their intended purpose, the language is clear, and the standards are consistent with AMS policy and authority.

The United States Standards for Grades of Apricots became effective on May 25, 1928, and has not been revised since
then. In June 1992, the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee (WAMC) requested the USDA to revise the standard.
Consisting of producers from various districts throughout the State, the WAMC recommends minimum size, pack, and
grade requirements each year for the Federal Marketing Order on Washington State grown apricots. Specifically,
the WAMC requested that skin breaks (cuts and stem punctures), and stem pulls be changed from ``free from'' defects
to ``free from damage'' or ``serious damage'' defects in the U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades, respectively. Such changes
would have the effect of allowing these defects on fruit in various degrees without being scored against the grade
(versus ``free from'' which means they are scored on sight). According to the WAMC, ``This will provide the industry
with the opportunity to expand markets into Canada.'' WAMC also suggested that the Department should make any other
revisions deemed necessary. 
AMS reviewed these issues to ascertain the need for the change proposed by WAMC as well as other technical changes or
updates that the Agency believed may be helpful. Many suggestions and comments were received pertaining to an informal
market survey by AMS. These comments reinforced that updating changes were necessary to bring the standard in line
with today's marketing practices. 
These changes as well as the request by the WAMC pertaining to skin breaks were incorporated in the proposed rule, United
States Standards for Grades of Apricots [7 CFR 51.2925-51.2934], which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 11, 1994 [59 FR 1490]. The 60-day comment period ended March 14, 1994, and a total of fourteen comments were
received concerning the proposal.

Six of these comments were in favor of the proposal. Four of these commentors were shippers/packers/growers from
Washington State, one from Idaho, and one from California. One commentor who felt that the standard should allow some
skin breaks asserted that, ``We felt that these were very good quality apricots and would have been received by our
Canadian customers and they would have been very well satisfied with our quality just like our customers in the United
States.'' Another commentor stated that ``This injury is slight, and does not detract from the quality or appearance
of the fruit, but under present U.S. grade standards it can not be marketed.'' 
A comment from a grower in Idaho suggested extending the definition to hail damage. The proposal considers a broken
skin due to hail to be considered as serious damage. However, the grower suggested providing a 3/16 inch aggregate
surface area and 1/16 inch depth maximum allowance to broken skins due to hail injury. 
Also, a grower/packer/shipper from California commented that although they intended to maintain their current
level of quality, they did not object to the proposal to lower the grade standards. ``If Washington state apricot shippers
perceive a market for their apricots with reduced grade standards, then they must be allowed to access that market.
Lowering the export grade standard does not require export buyers to purchase product with more defects. It does,
however, provide them with an option for access to possibly more product at a potentially more attractive price to
consumers. Although this may result in reduced market share for California apricot shippers, it must not be the intent
of grade standards to grant favor to one shipping region over another. The dynamics of the marketplace must prevail
without the intervention of excessive grade standards that prohibit a mutually beneficial transaction between
a buyer and seller.'' 
Eight comments were received which were against the proposed changes regarding skin breaks. Six of these comments
were from grower/packer/shippers in the State of California, one comment from the California Apricot Advisory Board
(CAAB), and one comment from the National Association of Perishable Agricultural Receivers (NAPAR). 
One grower from California commented, ``My experience with skin breaks (cuts and stem punctures) on mature apricots
is not good. Discoloration and rot begin to form almost immediately after a skin break occurs at harvest time. This
severely shortens the already short shelf life of the damaged apricot. Neither the retailer nor the consumer benefit
in such a situation.'' 
Another grower commented, ``We feel that if growers and shippers such as those in Washington are allowed to ship lower
quality and potentially disease-vulnerable fruit the opportunity to build a growing and reliable export market
will be severely retarded.'' 
The CAAB noted in its comment three reasons for objecting to the skin break changes: (1) ``Increasing the size and depth
of skin breaks, stem pulls and bruises will further reduce the grocery trade's confidence in U.S. Apricots * * *
Questionable and erratic quality of apricots is still one of this industry's serious problems.'' (2) ``The next several
years will see a substantial increase in the production of apricots both in California and Washington. This means
that export potential will be needed to absorb this volume growth. Fruit that has greater damage tolerances at present
will severely threaten our ability to utilize this vitally needed outlet. Export markets take longer to reach increasing
the danger of fruit spoilage from wounds.'' (3) ``It can't be stressed enough that the risk of infected fruit spreading
to entire containers and even loads by the time they reach their destination is a potential problem far beyond that
of approving just a few damaged apricots at point of inspection.'' 
NAPAR's comment summarized its viewpoint with the following statement, ``We oppose the removal of fresh cuts, stem
puncture and stem pulls from the FREE FROM defects clause in both grades, U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2. These defects will
permit pathogenic microorganisms to enter the product at shipping point, developing during transit, distant terminal
markets, storage and or at retail outlets and develop into decay or serious discolorations resulting in great losses
to the receivers and retailers. Additionally and not of lesser importance, if we allow the marketing of apricots in
a world wide produce marketing system, we can expect other countries to request to import into the United States fruits
of the same poor quality or otherwise unsalable product. To prevent foreign countries from requesting to import to
the United States product of this quality and condition, we should maintain a strict U.S. Standards for Grades of all
commodities grown in the United States of America.''

AMS has considered these comments and agrees that skin breaks should remain as a ``free from'' defect for both grades.
The agency also believes that the other changes proposed to update and modernize the standard are important and will
be incorporated as a result of this final rule. 
The rationale for this decision is two-fold: First, the record supports maintaining the definition of skin breaks
as it now exists in the standard. As indicated above, the stronger case is made for not allowing greater damage tolerances.
Second, most comments in favor of the proposed change were based on the belief that this would allow shipment of more
apricots into Canada. 
Canadian Import Requirements state that apricots must meet a U.S. grade to be shipped to Canada. If apricots fail to
grade based on skin breaks, then the lot cannot be shipped to Canada. The Canadian government generally defines its
import requirements in terms of U.S. standards for the convenience of U.S. shippers, but that does not mean the U.S.
standards have to be the terms of regulation for the Canadian government's import requirements. Ultimately, inclusion
of skin breaks in the U.S. standard may only prompt the Canadian government to specify their requirements for no skin
breaks outside the standard. 
The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) develops and improves standards of quality, condition, grade, and packaging
to enhance the marketing of agricultural commodities by fostering consistency in commercial practices. The Agency
has determined this final rule will enhance the marketing of apricots. The provisions of this final rule are the same
as those in the proposed rule except for skin breaks as previously mentioned and for the editorial changes made for
clarity. 
Accordingly, this revision shall become effective 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

Expenses and Assessment Rates for the 1994-95 Fiscal Year for Specified Marketing Orders 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim
final rule which authorized expenses and established assessment rates for the 1994-95 fiscal year for Marketing
Orders (M.O.) No.'s 922 and 923, covering apricots and sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington,
and M.O. No. 924 covering fresh prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon.
Authorization of these budgets enables the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee, the Washington Cherry Marketing
Committee, and the Washington-Oregon Fresh Prune Marketing Committee (Committees) established under these marketing
orders to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer the programs
are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreements and Marketing Order No. 922 [7 CFR part 922] regulating the handling
of apricots grown in designated counties in Washington; Marketing Order No. 923 [7 CFR part 923] regulating the handling
of sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington; and Marketing Order No. 924 [7 CFR part 924] regulating
the handling of fresh prunes grown in designated counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon. The marketing
agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C.
601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, apricots and sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, and fresh prunes grown in designated
counties in Washington and in Umatilla County, Oregon are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rates specified herein will be applicable to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and fresh prunes handled during
the 1994-95 fiscal year, which began April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any
State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are about 55 handlers of Washington apricots, 55 handlers of Washington sweet cherries, and 30 handlers of Washington-Oregon
fresh prunes subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders. In addition, there are about 190 Washington
apricot producers, 1,100 Washington sweet cherry producers, and 350 Washington-Oregon fresh prune producers in
the respective production areas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 

An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each marketing order committee and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the
Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly
affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by each Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the tons of fresh
fruit expected to be shipped under the order. Because the rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established
at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. Recommended budgets and
rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred
on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committees will
have funds to pay their expenses. 

The Washington Apricot Marketing Committee met on 
May 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 expenses of $13,602, which is $1,216 more in expenses than
the $12,386 amount that was recommended for the 1993-94 fiscal year. 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.00 per ton of fresh apricots, which is a decrease
of $2.50 in the assessment rate. In comparison, the 1993-94 assessment rate was $2.50 per ton. The Committee
unanimously recommended bringing forward its reserve fund of $22,170 to pay budgeted expenses for the 1994-95
fiscal year as an alternative to charging handlers an assessment rate. Shipments of fresh apricots are estimated
at 5,200 tons. 

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $8,568, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 

The Washington Cherry Marketing Committee met on 
May 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994-95 expenses of $100,213 and an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton
of sweet cherries. In comparison, 1993-94 budgeted expenses were $139,313, with an approved assessment rate
of $3.00 per ton. This represents a $39,100 decrease in expenses and a $2.00 decrease in the assessment rate from the
amounts recommended for the current fiscal year. 

The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 40,000 tons of cherries, would yield $40,000 in assessment
income. Adequate funds exists in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses. 

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $74,695, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 

The Washington-Oregon Fresh Prune Marketing Committee met on June 1, 1994, and recommended 1994-95 expenses
of $18,760, which represents a $8,042 decrease in expenses from the $26,802 that was recommended for 1993-94
fiscal year.

<DOCNO> FR940928-0-00015 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of fresh prunes. In comparison, this
is $2.00 less than the $3.00 per ton assessment rate that was approved for the previous fiscal year. Shipments of fresh
prunes for 1994 are estimated at 6,500 tons, which would yield $6,500 in assessment income. Adequate funds exists
in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses. 

Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $22,800, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 

Major expense categories for the Committees are for the administration of these marketing orders and for fresh prune
research and sweet cherry market development activities. Administrative expenses include those for salaries,
travel, and office operations. The stone fruit marketing Committees share office expenses, based on an agreement
among the Committees. 

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 39415, August 3, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.


While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994-95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the rates
of assessment apply to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and prunes handled during the fiscal year. In addition,
handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committees at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.

Milk in the Middle Atlantic Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document suspends certain provisions of the Middle Atlantic Federal milk marketing order for the months of September
1994 through February 1995. The suspension reduces the percent of receipts that must be disposed of as Class I disposition
by pool distributing plants, provides automatic pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants
that were pool plants during the preceding months of September through February, and suspends the limit on the amount
of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by cooperative associations and by pool plant operators. The suspension
was requested by several Middle Atlantic cooperatives and handlers. The suspension is necessary to assure that producer
milk historically associated with the market will continue to be pooled and priced under the order without incurring
unnecessary and uneconomic movements solely for the purpose of maintaining pool status. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 



Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued August 8, 1994; published August 12, 1994 (59 FR 41413). 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 

The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 

This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the
order regulating the handling of milk in the Middle Atlantic marketing area.

Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 12, 1994 (59 FR 41413) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons
were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. No opposing comments were received.


After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995, the following
provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 

1. In  1004.7(a), the words ``40 percent in the months of September through February, and'' and ``in the months
of March through August''. 

2. In  1004.7(e), the word ``immediately'' and the words ``for each of the following months of March through
August,''. 

3. In the introductory text of  1004.12(d), the words ``in accordance with the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1)
and (d)(2) of this section.'' 

4. In  1004.12, paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2). 



Statement of Consideration 



This suspension reduces the total Class I disposition standard for pool distributing plants, provides automatic
pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during each of the preceding
months of September through February, and suspends the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants
by cooperative associations and pool plant operators. 

The first provision suspended reduces the percentage of a distributing plant's receipts that have to be disposed
of as Class I milk to meet the order's pooling standards. With the suspension, a pool distributing plant will have to
use at least 30 percent, rather than 40 percent, of its monthly milk receipts as Class I milk during September 1994 through
February 1995. 

The second provision suspended permits supply plants and reserve processing plants that have met the order's pooling
standards during the months of September 1993 through February 1994 to retain pool status for the months of September
1994 through August 1995. The shipping requirements that normally would have applied to such plants during the months
of September 1994 through February 1995 are eliminated under the suspension. 

The third provision included in the suspension removes the limit on the percentage of milk that may be diverted to nonpool
plants by a cooperative association or a pool plant operator for the period of September 1994 through February 1995.


The suspension was requested by Pennmarva Dairymen's Federation, Inc., Atlantic Processing, Inc., Dairylea, Eastern
Milk Producers Cooperative, and Lehigh Valley Dairies. Together these organizations market over 90 percent of the
market's producer milk. 

As the proponents contended, producer receipts between 1991 and 1993 on Order 4 increased while the percentage of
the market's producer milk used for Class I purposes consistently decreased. A comparison of monthly Class I percentages
for the months of September through February of 1991, 1992, and 1993 show the continuing decline. For example, the
Class I use percentage for September 1991 was 56.2, while in September 1993 it was 51.4 percent. The reduction in Class
I use results in an increase in diversions to nonpool plants, making it increasingly difficult for cooperatives and
pool plant operators to maintain the pool status of the milk of producers who have historically been associated with
the market. 

In addition to the decline in Class I use, two large Order 4 distributing plants with which large volumes of Order 4 diverted
milk had been associated became regulated under the New York-New Jersey order, another Order 4 distributing plant
closed, and two additional Order 4 distributing plants have changed their product mix, causing a reduction of pool
plant deliveries for the cooperatives supplying milk to these plants. These changes have caused cooperatives and
pool plants under the order to experience difficulty in associating all of their diverted producer milk with the remaining
distributing plants now regulated under the Middle Atlantic order because the additional diverted milk is reducing
the Class I use percentage of the plants from which it is diverted, thereby jeopardizing their status as pool plants.


The suspension is found to be necessary to reduce uneconomic movements of milk solely for the purpose of meeting pool
qualifications, and will reflect current marketing conditions without causing the milk of producers long associated
with the Middle Atlantic marketing area to become depooled.

It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who

(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written

Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the

Milk in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Marketing Area; Temporary Revision of Rule 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary revision of rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document temporarily revises the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania
Federal milk order (Order 36) for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. Required shipping percentages
for pool supply plants are reduced by 10 percentage points for each of the affected months. This action is necessary
to prevent the uneconomic and inefficient movements of milk to qualify plants for pooling.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued August 22, 1994; published August
26, 1994 (59 FR 44088). 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 
This temporary revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the
provisions of  1036.7(f) of the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order. 
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44088) concerning a proposed temporary relaxation of the supply plant shipping standards under the Eastern
Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order. The revisions were proposed to be effective for the months of September 1,
1994, through February 28, 1995. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting
written data, views and arguments by September 2, 1994. One comment supporting the proposed revision was received.
No opposing comments were received.

Statement of Consideration 



Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total
quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing
plants regulated under the order or disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area. This provision is subject
to the following two conditions: (1) Not less than 45,000 pounds of Grade A fluid milk must be shipped from the supply
plant to a pool distributing plant during either September, October, or November; and (2) shipments used to determine
qualifying percentages must be milk transferred or diverted to and physically received by pool distributing plants,
less any transfers or diversions of bulk fluid milk products from such distributing pool plants. 

This rule temporarily revises the minimum requirement from 40 percent to 30 percent for the months of September through
November 1994, from 30 percent to 20 percent for the month of December 1994, and from 35 percent to 25 percent for the
months of January and February 1995. 

The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase
or decrease the required shipping percentages for supply plants by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is
necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 

The temporary revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool
supply plant regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus
distributing plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk
from a distributing plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away.
At the same time, Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations.
Brewster contends that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply
and distributing plants, undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable
and inefficient movements of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply
plant shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk. 

Milk Marketing Inc. (MMI), a dairy farmer cooperative representing 1,350 dairy farmers whose milk is pooled under
Order 36, supported Brewster's request for reducing shipping percentages for pool supply plants. MMI's comment
stated the cooperative supports Brewster's request for the same reasons MMI gave in a recent continued reduction
of shipping requirements for cooperative association reserve processing plants (59 FR 48557) in the Eastern Ohio-Western
Pennsylvania milk order. In this continued reduction, MMI's comments included a description of milk marketing conditions
for June 1994 that show milk production for the market increased over 4 percent from the same month of the previous year,
representing 12 million additional pounds of milk in the Order 36 pool. For the same month, Class I sales decreased
by nearly 2.5 percent from June 1993, representing a reduction of approximately 3.4 million pounds of Class I sales.
As a result of the market's increasing production and declining Class I use, nearly 15.5 million more pounds of milk
had to be used in manufactured products than in the same month the previous year. 

In view of the current supply and demand relationship for the market, the supply plant shipping percentages should
be reduced for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. A reduction of the shipping percentages will contribute
to orderly marketing in that costly and inefficient shipments of milk from distant supply plants will not be necessary.
Thus, dairy farmers who have supplied the market will continue to have their milk pooled under the order. 

After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that the supply plant shipping percentage set forth in  1036.7(b)
should be reduced to 30 percent for the months of September, October, and November 1994, reduced to 20 percent for the
month of December 1994, and reduced to 25 percent for the months of January and February 1995.

(a) This temporary revision is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to maintain orderly marketing
conditions in the marketing area for the months of September 1994 through

effective date; and 

(c) Notice of the proposed temporary revision was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to
file written data, views, or arguments concerning this temporary revision. One comment supporting the proposed
temporary revision was received, with no comments opposing. 

Therefore, good cause exists for making this temporary revision effective less than 30 days from the date of publication
in the

Action: 

Final rule; correction. 




Summary: 

The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) corrects errors on the final rule published on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6869-6897)
concerning cost containment. The intended effect of this action is to correct errors in the final rule. 



Effective Date: 

September 28, 1994.

Supplementary Information: 

FmHA published its final rule on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6869) which encompassed numerous additions and changes intended
to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Section 515 program, as well as to reduce costs associated with construction
and related amentities. 


(1) FmHA inadvertently included dishwashers as an acceptable feature in elderly unit design. Dishwashers are acceptable
only for central kitchens in congregate and group home projects. As stated, allowing dishwashers in elderly projects
when they are not even acceptable in individual congregate living units is contradictory and will lead to higher construction
costs. The results of this error would significantly conflict with the Agency's current emphasis on cost containment.

(2) A discrepancy exists in the language of Exhibit A-8 between the introductory page and paragraph IV Housing
demand forecasts. The word ``person'' referred to in ``Persons Living in Substandard Rental Units'' and ``Persons
Experiencing Rent Overburden'' outlined in paragraph IV should read ``Households'' as outlined in the introductory
page. In addition, paragraph IV Housing demand forecast requires the market analyst to subtract ``Comparable Rental
Units'' from the overall demand figure. These words were erroneously included in the housing demand calculation
and are being removed to prevent miscalculation of housing need and demand.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule publishes changes to requirements related to the Immigration User Fee Account (IUFA). The rule amends existing
regulations to comply with the 1991 and 1994 Department of Justice Appropriations Acts. In addition, this rule changes
where remittances shall be sent; requires additional information in the remittance and statement procedures for
fees; clarifies how remittances shall be paid; and makes a nomenclature change. Two minor technical corrections
are also being made to correct errors in the text of the regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction




The INS published a proposed rule on February 15, 1994, at 59 FR 7227, making changes to requirements related to the
Immigration User Fee Account. The proposed rule was published with a 60-day comment period. The public had the opportunity
to comment on the proposed rule through April 18, 1994.

Changes in current regulations are needed to make the regulations consistent with current law, and establish requirements
for fee collection data and remittance information. In addition, the final rule implements a nomenclature change
throughout 8 CFR 86 to remove the word ``Comptroller'' and to put in its place the words ``Associate Commissioner,
Finance,'' and makes two other technical corrections.

Comments were received from seven commenters, including three industry associations. All the comments were carefully
considered before preparing this final rule. Following is a discussion of the comments.



II. Summary of Comments



A. Monthly Summary Statement Requirement



Five commenters expressed dissatisfaction with this reporting requirement. One commenter expressed agreement
in principal with the proposed submission of monthly information related to the Immigration User Fees collected.

The commenters who expressed dissatisfaction with the reporting requirement indicated that the monthly requirement
would add an additional and costly reporting burden which would duplicate a quarterly remittance statement, and
would require carrier-ticketing information which is considered to be ``commercially confidential.'' One commenter
indicated that there would be timing difficulty in reporting information as required in the proposed rule, given
the dates airlines receive domestic and international sales reports. Along these same lines, another commenter
suggested that carriers be given at least 1 month to submit a report. Further, two commenters noted that the universal
scope of the requirement should be limited if the reporting requirement is published as a final rule. One of these suggested
that the requirement apply to high-volume carriers; the other suggested that it be applicable to carriers who consistently
fail to remit fees. Another of the comments suggested that, should the monthly reporting requirement be implemented,
it should include a ``sunset'' provision to discontinue the requirement after 2 years subject to evaluation of the
benefits in relation to the costs.

The commenter that supported the requirement believed that the monthly submission of a summary report for each month's
collections would assist the INS in developing more accurate budgets and in allocating funds for staff and equipment
as traffic patterns change.

The INS continues to believe that, in order to improve its financial management of the IUFA, it must have some indication
of fee remittances in advance of their receipt. Therefore, a report of net monthly collections will be required. As
a result of the type and timing of remittance data available, there has been difficulty in making resource estimates.
Remittances to INS represent passengers who purchased tickets during the remittance period, which is not necessarily
the same period in which the passenger will travel. The INS data are limited to the number of persons inspected and actual
remittances. Since the remittances are made on a quarterly basis, there is not timely information with which to make
accurate collection projections. For example, even though the fiscal year starts on October 1, the first remittances
for the fiscal year are not due until January 31 of each year. Historically, the bulk of these collections are received
in February and accounting records report them in March. Hence, it is mid-March before any picture of actual collections
comes into focus. The mid-point of the year is very late in the fiscal year to be making program and budget changes.

Concerning the comment which suggested that the monthly reporting requirement and the statement which accompanies
remittances are duplicative, INS believes that there is a misunderstanding concerning the purpose of each document.
The monthly report is to serve as a predictor of the amount of funds to be received, while the remittance statement provides
detailed information pertaining to a specific actual remittance. Each document has a separate, unique, and identifiable
purpose.

However, in response to the public's comments, INS is making the following changes. The INS will not require a reporting
of the number of ticket sales, given issues related to commercial confidentiality. In addition, in order to ease the
reporting burden, a report of remittances will be required only for carriers or ticket-selling agents whose fee collections
exceed $50,000 a month. Further, in response to the issue of duplication of reporting requirements, INS is making
an additional change. Since the quarterly remittance statement includes information for the last month in a given
quarter, a separate monthly report will not be required for those months. This means that monthly reporting will be
required for the months of October, November, January, February, April, May, July, and September. In order to allow
more reporting time, the report will be due to INS on the last business day of the following month.

<PARENT> FR940928-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, with regard to the suggestion to ``sunset'' the monthly reporting requirement, INS seriously considered
this comment. However, INS believes this to be an ongoing requirement which is needed to adequately manage the account.
Should the information become available from other sources, or should some other matters arise, INS will reevaluate
the requirement and modify the regulations as appropriate.



B. Record Retention Period



Three commenters addressed the proposed 5-year record-retention period. Each commenter indicated the extended
retention period was burdensome and costly, and that it exceeded the requirements of other Federal agencies. In view
of the comments received, the current 2-year retention period will remain in effect.

One commenter noted that the proposed rule did not specify the type of records and documents which must be kept. In response
to this comment, INS provides the following guidance. Each collector and remitter should maintain records necessary
for the carrier to demonstrate to the INS the accuracy of fees collected and remitted, and to otherwise determine compliance
with applicable statutes and regulations. Modern technology available to achieve this result may be utilized.



C. Fourth Quarter Remittance of Fees



Two commenters addressed the remittance deadline for fourth quarter immigration user fees. One commenter objected
to the September 20 due date for the remittance of fourth quarter fees. A second suggested that the final rule clarify
that the fourth quarter remittance should include collections from the months of July and August for that year.

The rule establishes the fourth quarter remittance due dates in order to make the regulation consistent with a statutory
change. The 1991 Department of Justice Appropriations Act (Public Law 101-515, November 5, 1990), as amended
by section 309(a)(2)(b) of Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (Pub.
L. 102-232, December 12, 1991), changed the remittance schedule for the fourth quarter.



D. Change in the Immigration User Fee



One commenter urged that the Immigration User Fee not be raised from $5.00 to $6.00 per passenger.

The change in the User Fee is mandated by statute. The 1994 Department of Justice Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103-121,
October 27, 1993) increased the fee to $6.00 per passenger. The regulation is being changed to be consistent with the
law.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation, and by approving it, certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the following factors. Most of the regulation
updates the CFR to conform with current law. The reporting requirement is constructed so that only major entities
are required to report. Further, the information required under this rule should be readily available from business
records which must be maintained as a routine business practice.



Executive Order 12866



This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866,  3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A). 



Executive Order 12612



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, the relationship between
the National Government and the States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Airworthiness Directives; Saab Model SF340A and SAAB 340B Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects a typographical error that appeared in the above-captioned airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to certain Saab Model SF340A and 
SAAB 340B series airplanes. That AD currently requires inspections to detect 
discrepancies of certain main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; 
replacement of discrepant parts; installation of washers, if necessary; and eventual 
replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose 
landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. This action corrects terms in the 
compliance time specified for the requirement to remove the NLG trunnion pin cross 
bolts. This action is necessary to ensure that operators are not required to perform 
actions at a time that does not correspond with scheduled maintenance. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 24, 1994, the FAA issued AD 
94-18-05, amendment 39-9018 (59 FR 46543, September 9, 1994), to require inspections 
to detect discrepancies of certain main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket 
retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation of washers, if necessary; and 
eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain 
nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. That action was prompted by reports 
of extension and retraction problems on the MLG, due to loose retract actuator brackets 
on the MLG shock struts. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent a 
loose retract actuator bracket from interfering with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, 
which could result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract. 





Recently, the FAA has become aware of a typographical error that appeared in 
paragraph (c) of the published final airworthiness directive, which would incorrectly require operators to 
replace the NLG trunnion pin cross bolts at a time that may not correspond with 
scheduled maintenance for the NLG. The compliance time for paragraph (c) was 
incorrectly published as, ``At the next MLG overhaul, or within 12,000 landings after the 
effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier * * *'' However, the correct compliance 
time for that requirement should have referred to ``* * * at the next NLG overhaul.'' 


Since it is essential that operators perform the replacement in a timely manner and 
at a time when the NLG is normally serviced, this document corrects the compliance 
terms of paragraph (c) of AD 94-18-05, amendment 39-9018, to read as follows: 

``(c) At the next NLG overhaul, or within 12,000 landings after the effective date 
of this AD, whichever occurs earlier, remove the existing nose landing gear trunnion pin 
cross bolt, 
P/N NAS 1305-54D, and replace it with a new bolt, P/N NAS 1305-50D, in 
accordance with Paragraphs C. through F. of the Accomplishment Instructions of Saab 
Service Bulletin 340-32-094, dated October 29, 1993, or Revision 1, dated March 4, 1994.'' 

The effective date of the rule remains October 11, 1994. 

Since no other portion of the regulatory information has been changed, the final rule is not being republished.





Issued in Renton, Washington, on September 21, 1994.

Biologics; Technical Amendment


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the biologics regulations by substituting the term ``supplement''
for ``amendment'' when referring to the submission of a change to an approved establishment license or product license
application. This action is being taken to harmonize the regulations with terminology used in the Prescription Drug
User Fee Act of 1992.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-571) (section 735 (21 U.S.C. 379g)) defines the term ``supplement''
as ``a request to the Secretary to approve a change in a human drug application which has been approved.'' Also in section
735 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a ``human drug application'' includes ``an application for licensure of
a biological product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.'' FDA is amending the biologics regulations
by substituting the term ``supplement'' for ``amendment.'' This change is being made to harmonize the regulations
with the terminology used in the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992.


Prior to this announced change in terminology, the term ``amendment'' was used for all changes to both approved and
unapproved license applications and amendments. In general, FDA intends to use the term ``supplement'' when referring
to the submission of a change to an approved license application, and the term ``amendment'' when referring to the
submission of a change to an unapproved license application or amendment. This change will not affect pending supplements
(amendments) to establishment or product license applications.
This final rule contains only a minor change that is necessary to clarify terminology in the regulations. The rule
change will not affect the way a license amendment or supplement to an application should be submitted to the agency,
except in the way it is identified; nor will the change affect the way a license amendment or supplement will be reviewed
by FDA. Therefore, FDA finds that there is good cause to dispense with a notice of proposed rulemaking as unnecessary,
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations
(21 CFR 10.40(e)). FDA also finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that there is good cause to
make this final rule effective on the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. FDA, however, is allowing 75 days for public comment on this final rule, in accordance with 21 CFR 10.40(e)(1).
Interested persons may, on or before December 12, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will consider any comments
submitted to determine if any additional changes to the regulations are necessary.

Neomycin Phosphotransferase II; Tolerance Exemption




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of neomycin phosphotransferase
II (NPTII) and the genetic material necessary for its production when used as a plant pesticide inert ingredient.
Monsanto Co. petitioned EPA for this exemption.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64582, 64583), EPA issued notices which announced that Monsanto Co., 700 Chesterfield Parkway
North, St. Louis, MO 63193, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4273) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180
to establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII), and the
genetic material necessary to produce NPTII when produced in plants as a plant pesticide inert ingredient. The Agency
did not receive any comments on the notices. Selectable markers such as NPTII are considered inert ingredients by
the Agency when they are introduced into a plant in order to ensure or confirm the presence of a plant pesticide. The
genetic material necessary to produce NPTII (the NPTII gene) is also considered part of the inert ingredient; therefore,
the NPTII gene is also addressed in this final rule.


Neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) is uniquely different from other types of inert ingredients because it is
a selectable marker used to identify plant cells early in the product development that had been successfully transformed
to express the active ingredient.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and deemed sufficient to support
the tolerance. The rationale for this decision is described below.


Assessment of Data


The Agency has evaluated the toxicology data, information on product identity, equivalence of microbially and plant
produced NPTII, and other information provided by the petitioner. The information showed that the plant and microbially
produced protein are similar with respect to the protein characteristics of amino acid sequence, enzyme activity,
electrophoretic mobility, lack of glycosylation, and specific antibody recognition. These findings justified
the use of microbial protein in the toxicity studies. The registrant provided the following studies: Acute Oral Toxicity
of NPTII in Mice and an In Vitro Digestion of the NPTII Protein. A single oral exposure dose of 5 g/kg NPTII protein produced
no adverse effects in mice. The In Vitro Digestion study showed that the protein was rapidly degraded in simulated
gastric or intestinal digestive fluids to fragments that were no longer recognized by specific antibodies to NPTII.
These results suggest the NPTII protein will not survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore,
the Agency concluded that the information provided was sufficient to assess the acute toxicity of NPTII when used
as a marker gene in transgenic plants expressing plant pesticides and to justify an exemption from the requirement
for a food tolerance for residues of the inert. The Agency recognizes that alternative information could be used to
indicate the lack of mammalian toxicity and to justify a tolerance exemption. 
Since no toxicity was indicated, residue chemistry data were not required. Residue data are necessary only if the
submitted toxicity studies indicate that additional toxicology data were needed. These additional data were not
needed. Therefore, no residue data are required in order to grant an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for the plant pesticide inert ingredient neomycin phosphotransferase II when used as a plant pesticide inert ingredient,
as expressed in plant cells. 
The exemption from a tolerance for the genetic material which encodes for production of NPTII is based on the fact that
the nucleic acids which form the genetic material are found in all foods and have not, by themselves, been associated
with toxic or pathogenic effects in animals and humans. None of the constituents of nucleic acids are known to be acute
toxicants by themselves but, like proteins and other normal constituents in food, may cause indirect, adverse metabolic
effects if consumed exclusively at high doses over a long period of time in the absence of a normal diet. The NPTII gene
will not occur at these high amounts in plants. Thus, EPA does not believe there is a potential for adverse health effects
related to the consumption of plants containing the NPTII gene.
Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition
because the data/information submitted demonstrate that this plant-pesticide inert ingredient (NPTII) and the
NPTII gene are not toxic to mammalian species. No enforcement actions are expected based upon the level of residue
for NPTII and the genetic material necessary for its production. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method
for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption. 
Based on the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful for the purpose for which the tolerance exemption is sought. Based on the information
considered, EPA concludes that a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, the exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance is established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for
this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and
the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i).
If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested,
the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (49 FR 24950).

Suspension of Community Eligibility 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the 

Federal Register

.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 

et seq.

 Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of that date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt and submit the required
documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is published but prior to the
actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their eligibility for the sale
of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 



In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column. 

The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 

Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

National Environmental Policy Act


This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action. 


Regulatory Classification

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Technical amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice reinstates Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c of 49 CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, which
were inadvertently omitted from Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 400-999 as of October 1, 1993.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 3, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule which, among other things, revised and redesignated certain paragraphs
of S5.1 of Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, 

Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment

 (58 FR 12183).





Before the final rule, paragraph S5.1.1.11 contained internal references to Figures 1a and 1b, and paragraph S5.1.1.12
an internal reference to Figure 1c. The final rule redesignated S5.1.1.11 as S5.1.1.6, and revised it to incorporate
the substance of S5.1.1.12, including the reference to Figure 1c. (Further amendments adopted a new paragraph S5.1.1.11,
removed S5.1.1.12, and redesignated S5.1.1.32 as S5.1.1.12.) 

NHTSA has been informed by the 

Federal Register

 that, because the amendatory language of the final rule did not contain instructions where to place Figures 1a, 1b,
and 1c within the text of Standard No. 108, the figures were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations. This document
reinstates those figures, to follow the text of S5.1.1.6. 




Effective Date



Because this amendment is corrective in nature and imposes no additional burden upon any person, notice and comment
upon are not required under the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is found, for good cause shown, that an effective
date earlier than 180 days after issuance is in the public interest. The amendment will become effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

.

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; Correction



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule corrects the final rule to implement Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources
of the Gulf of Mexico, which was published on August 2, 1994. This correction also extends the effective date of certain
amendments previously published.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The final rule to implement Amendment 9, among other things, extended the red snapper endorsement system and its associated
trip and landing limits from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995.
Changes to the regulatory text clearly stated this extended effectiveness regarding the endorsement system.



The intent to extend the effectiveness of the associated trip and landing limits, and associated prohibitions, which
originally appear at 58 FR 33027, June 15, 1993, and 58 FR 68326, December 27, 1993, was stated in the preamble of the
final rule to implement Amendment 9, but was inadvertently omitted from the 

EFFECTIVE DATE

 section.

In the final rule, the telephone numbers of the Regional Director and of the Regulations and Permits Branch, Southeast
Region, NMFS, are incorrect. The address of the Southeast Region as published under the definition of ``Regional
Director'' requires a revision.

Accordingly, the publication on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39301), of the final regulations (I.D. 041994B), which were
the subject of FR Doc. 94-18683, is corrected as follows:

1. On page 39301, in the third column, under the 

EFFECTIVE DATE

 heading, add the following sentence to the end: ``In addition, 50 CFR 641.7 (u), (v), and (w) and 50 CFR 641.21(d), which
were to expire December 31, 1994, are extended through December 31, 1995.''



 641.2 

[Corrected]



2. On page 39304, in the first column, in  641.2, in the definition of 

Regional Director,

 in line 3, the address is corrected by inserting ``N.'' after ``Drive'' and in line 4, the telephone number is corrected
to read ``813-570-5301''.



 641.10 

[Corrected]



3. On page 39304, in the third column, in  641.10(b)(3), in the next to last line, the telephone number is corrected
to read ``813-570-5326''.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure of a commercial fishery for king mackerel.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS closes the commercial fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for king mackerel from the western zone of
the Gulf migratory group. This closure is necessary to protect the overfished Gulf king mackerel resource.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,
and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic
Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.


Catch limits recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for the Gulf of Mexico migratory group of king mackerel
set the commercial quota at 0.77 million lb (0.35 million kg) for the western zone.
Under  642.26(a), NMFS is required to close any segment of the king mackerel commercial fishery when its allocation
or quota has been reached, or is projected to be reached, by publishing a document in the 

Federal Register

. NMFS has determined that the commercial quota of 0.77 million lb (0.35 million kg) for the western zone of the Gulf
migratory group of king mackerel was reached on September 23, 1994. Hence, the commercial fishery for Gulf group king
mackerel from the western zone is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, September 24, 1994, through June 30, 1995,
the end of the fishing year. The boundary between the eastern and western zones is a line directly south from the Florida/Alabama
boundary (87




31
'06
'
' W. long.).
Except for a person aboard a charter vessel, during the closure, no person aboard a vessel permitted to fish under a
commercial allocation may fish for, retain, or have in possession in the EEZ, king mackerel from the western zone.
A person aboard a charter vessel may continue to fish for king mackerel in the  western zone under the bag limit set forth
in  642.24(a)(1)(i), provided the vessel is under charter and the vessel has an annual charter vessel permit,
as specified in  642.4(a)(2). A charter vessel with a permit to fish on a commercial allocation is under charter
when it carries a passenger who fishes for a fee or when there are more than three persons aboard, including operator
and crew.
During the closure, king mackerel from the western zone taken in the EEZ, including those harvested under the bag limit,
may not be purchased, bartered, traded, or sold. This prohibition does not apply to trade in king mackerel from the
western zone that were harvested, landed, and bartered, traded, or sold prior to the closure and held in cold storage
by a dealer or processor.

This action is taken under 50 CFR 642.26(a) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

Vessels of the United States Fishing in Colombian Treaty Waters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to amend the regulations that govern fishing by vessels of the United States in certain
waters of the Caribbean Sea covered by a treaty between the United States and the Government of Colombia (GOC). This
rule requires that such vessels in treaty waters display their official numbers and that fish and lobster traps used
in treaty waters have degradable panels. The intended effect of this rule is to implement conservation and management
measures agreed to in consultations between the United States and the GOC. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Fishing by vessels of the United States in certain waters of the Caribbean Sea is governed under the Treaty Between
the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Colombia Concerning the Status
of Quita Sueno, Roncador and Serrana (treaty). Under the terms of the treaty, vessels of the United States may fish
in the waters of Quita Sueno, Roncador, and Serrana (treaty waters), but are subject to reasonable conservation measures
applied by the GOC, provided that such measures are nondiscriminatory and no more restrictive than those applied
to Colombian or other fishermen. 


NMFS published proposed and final rules on September 18, 1990 (55 FR 38365) and January 4, 1991 (56 FR 377), respectively,
that implemented regulations for treaty waters. Included in the proposed rule were requirements that (1) U.S. vessels
display their official numbers when in treaty waters, and (2) nonwooden fish and lobster traps in treaty waters have
degradable panels. These requirements were not included in the final rule because a necessary exchange of notes between
the United States and the GOC regarding the requirements had not occurred. Such exchange of notes was made at a meeting
of representatives of the two governments on May 17-18, 1994, at Cartagena, Colombia. Accordingly, the requirements
are added to the regulations. Rationale for the requirements was included in the proposed rule and is not repeated
here. 
This final rule also corrects the address of the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (``Regional Director''); and adds
a prohibition on making a false statement to an authorized officer concerning the taking, catching, harvesting,
landing, purchase, sale, possession, or transfer of fish. The added prohibition is necessary for effective enforcement
and conforms the regulations to current standards. 


Changes From the Proposed Rule 


Minor language changes are made to clarify the regulations and conform them to current standards. 


Classification 


This rule is necessary to implement agreements between the United States and the GOC. Because it pertains to a foreign
affairs function of the United States, it is exempt from the provisions of E.O. 12866, and from the requirement to provide
notice and an opportunity for public comment pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction 


Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub. L. 94-163, as amended by the National
Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95-619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA)
of 1987, Pub. L. 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L.
100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Pub. L. 102-486, created the Energy Conservation Program
for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program).

1

 The consumer and commercial products currently subject to this Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered
products'') include general service fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps, the subject of today's
notice. 




Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation
standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required
to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. Test procedures
shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual
operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly
burdensome to conduct. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedure is not required if the Department of Energy determines
by rule that one cannot be developed. Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eighty days after a test procedure for a product
is adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumption or cost of energy consumed by the product except
as reflected in tests conducted according to the Department of Energy procedure. Section 323(c)(2). 
However, the 180-day period referred to in section 323(c)(2) may be extended for an additional 180 days if the Secretary
determines that the requirements of section 323(c)(2) would impose undue burden. Section 323(c)(3). Test procedures
appear at 10 CFR Part 430, subpart B. 
Labeling rules for household appliances and certain commercial products are administered by the Federal Trade Commission.

Section 323(b)(6) of the Act also specifies that the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures for fluorescent lamps
and incandescent reflector lamps taking into consideration the applicable standards of the Illuminating Engineering
Society or American National Standards Institute. These test procedures have all been reviewed by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology in consultation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. DOE has determined
that these test procedures will meet its needs. Therefore, today's Interim Final Rule incorporates by reference:
The test methods found in Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM-9-88 for testing and measuring
the performance of general service fluorescent lamps; Illuminating Engineering Society test procedures LM-58-1983,
and LM-16-1984 and the International Commission on Illumination publication number 13.2-1974
for measuring the color rendering index of general service fluorescent lamps which is incorporated by reference
in the Illuminating Engineering Society publication number LM-16-1984; and Illuminating Engineering
Society test procedure LM-20-1982 for testing and measuring the performance of incandescent reflector
lamps. Additionally, today's Interim Final Rule incorporates by reference the test methods found in Illuminating
Engineering Society test procedure LM-66-1991 for testing and measuring the performance of medium base
compact fluorescent lamps and Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM-45-91 for testing
and measuring the performance of general service incandescent lamps. 

The above test procedures do not provide for a measurement of annual energy consumption and annual operating cost
which are needed to comply with the Act. Therefore, the Department's test procedures include a method of calculating
the estimated annual energy consumption and the estimated annual operating cost. The Department is publishing elsewhere
in this issue a Proposed Rule amending part 430 to define colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps and to define
the exemption from energy conservation standards for a rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamp.




II. Discussion 



By this notice, the Department is adding a new section to establish test procedures for general service fluorescent
and incandescent lamps. These test procedures will apply to those products covered by sections 322(a)(14) and 325(i)(1)
of the Act. 



A. Covered Product 



The definitions of covered products are found in section 322 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act as amended.
For lamps, covered products in section 322(a)(14) include only specified fluorescent lamps, i.e., 4-foot medium
bi-pin, 2-foot U-shaped, 8-foot slimline and 8-foot high output, and incandescent reflector lamps. The Department
believes that covered lamps in section 322(a)(14) of the Act should also include general service fluorescent lamps,
medium base compact fluorescent lamps, and general service incandescent lamps as defined in  430.2 of this
notice, 

infra

. Adding these lamps to the covered products would be consistent with section 324(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, which requires
the Federal Trade Commission to label general service fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps,
and general service incandescent lamps. 



B. Test Procedure 



The Department is establishing test procedures in appendix R to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430 by reference to American
National Standards Institute standards C78.1-1991, C78.2-1978, C78.3-1991, C78.375-1991,
C82.3-1983, Illuminating Engineering Society standards LM-9-1988, LM-16-1984,
LM-20-1982, LM-45-1991, LM-58-1983, LM-66-1991 and International
Commission on Illumination publication 13.2-1974 which is incorporated by reference in the Illuminating
Engineering Society publication number LM-16-1984. Any subsequent amendment to this standard by the
standard-setting organizations, American National Standards Institute, the Illuminating Engineering Society,
or the International Commission on Illumination, will not affect the Department of Energy test procedures, which
can be amended only by the Department of Energy. This test procedure will provide, 

inter alia,

 results suitable for determining whether the covered lamps comply with the standard levels established by the Act.


Although the Department's authority to prescribe test procedures under section 323(b)(6) is limited to fluorescent
lamps and incandescent reflector lamps, the Department is incorporating by reference test procedures for general
service incandescent lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps by authority of section 323(b)(2) of the Act.
Data from these test procedures can also be used in the labeling program administered by the Federal Trade Commission.


The test procedure for general service fluorescent lamps is a method for measuring the lumen output of a seasoned lamp
(the lamp is initially burned for 100 hours) in an integrating sphere or alternatively, by intensity distribution
measurements (Illuminating Engineering Society LM-9-1988). Requirements for test conditions, equipment,
instrumentation, procedures, and test report are included. 

The test procedure for general service incandescent lamps (Illuminating Engineering Society LM-45-1991)
is a method for determining the luminous output of general service incandescent lamps based upon measurement. Three
methods are described in LM-45-1991, an integrating sphere, a goniometer, and substitution measurements,
but the Department is incorporating only the integrating sphere and goniometer test methods because they are more
accurate. Lamps shall be tested at 60 Hz and 120 volts regardless of their voltage rating.

The test procedure for incandescent reflector lamps (Illuminating Engineering Society LM-20-1982)
is a method for determining the luminous output of incandescent reflector lamps based upon measurement. Two methods
are described in LM-20-1982, one using an integrating sphere, and the other using intensity distribution
measurements. The Department of Energy test procedures incorporate only the intensity distribution measurement
procedure because it is more accurate and measurements on similar lamps are more consistent. Requirements for test
conditions, equipment, instrumentation, procedures and test report are included. 

The test procedure for medium base compact fluorescent lamps is a method for measurement of the lumen output of a seasoned
lamp (100 hours burn-in) in an integrating sphere or by intensity distribution measurements (Illuminating Engineering
Society LM-66-1991). The test procedure requires measurement of the lamp and ballast combination. Therefore,
only section 4, reference ballasts, section 5, circuits, and section 6, lamp connections, are incorporated from
Illuminating Engineering Society LM-66-1991. Because measurements without a reference ballast may
exhibit greater variance in the lumen output and watt input measurements, the Department of Energy invites comments
addressing the appropriate confidence bounds and sample size for these lamps. 



C. Basic Model 



The Department is including in today's rulemaking definitions of ``basic models'' of general service fluorescent
lamp, and general service incandescent lamp in  430.2. These definitions will separate the various types of
general service fluorescent lamps by electrical and photometric characteristics, e.g., lamp efficacy, wattage,
and color rendering index. General service incandescent lamps are distinguished by their wattage and lamp efficacy.
Each unit within a basic model must have the same electrical characteristics. Furthermore, each unit within a given
basic model cannot have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption. 



D. Measures of Energy Consumption 



The Department of Energy in today's notice is adopting three measures of energy consumption: (a) Estimated annual
operating cost, (b) lamp efficacy, and (c) estimated annual energy consumption. These measures are to be included
in  430.22(r). The estimated annual operating cost, lamp efficacy, and estimated annual energy consumption
will provide the consumer with three means of evaluating the energy efficiency of fluorescent and incandescent reflector
lamps. The Department has based the calculations of the measures of energy consumption for general service fluorescent
lamps on the use of Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM-9-1988, for general service incandescent
lamps on Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM-45-1991, for incandescent reflector lamps on
Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM-20-1982 and for medium base compact fluorescent lamps
on Illuminating Engineering Society Standard LM-66-1991. 

 The estimated annual operating cost is expressed in dollars per year. It is the product of the Department of
Energy representative unit energy cost for electricity, the input power, and the representative average use cycle.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940928-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940928-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The estimated annual energy consumption is expressed in kilowatt-hours per year. It is the product of the input
power and the representative average use cycle. 

 The lamp efficacy is a ratio of lamp lumen output to total input wattage as determined by the use of the measurement
procedures in Illuminating Engineering Society LM-9-1988, LM-20-1982, LM-45-1991
or LM-66-1991. 




E. Color Rendering Index (CRI) 


The Color Rendering Index is referenced in Illuminating Engineering Society LM-16-1984 which the Department
is incorporating by reference. This guide discusses several techniques for assessing light source color appearance.
The relationship between color appearance and light source spectral power distribution is discussed, along with
the systems for classifying color appearance. The basics of spectroradiometry and colorimetry are covered. 

The Color Rendering Index is determined by measuring the degree of color shift objects undergo when illuminated by
a light source as compared with the color of those same objects when illuminated by a reference source of comparable
color temperature. This index is determined pursuant to the International Commission on Illumination Publication
13.2-1974 which the Department is incorporating by reference. The method uses spectroradiometric measurements
and a detailed calculation procedure. It is applicable to most general purpose lamp types including general service
fluorescent and incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps and compact fluorescent lamps. 

Spectroradiometric measurements and equipment setup follow the guidance in Illuminating Engineering Society
LM-58-1983 which is being incorporated by reference. This guide describes the equipment used in making
spectroradiometric measurements, the procedures to be followed in using the equipment, and the precautions that
should be taken to obtain consistently valid results. The methods are applicable to all lamp types, and are based on
the measurement of the complete spectral power distribution of the source. Data presentation and error analysis
are discussed. 



F. Number of Units to be Tested 



The Act specifies that applicable fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps shall meet the standard. Furthermore,
the Act requires that the certification report include the lumen output and wattage consumption for each lamp type
as an average of measurements taken over the preceding 12 months. The Department believes that the sampling plan for
fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps provides a sound statistical basis for measurements. 

The Department is adopting at  430.23(r) a sampling plan based on a 99 percent confidence level for testing general
service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and medium base
compact fluorescent lamps. The sampling provisions the Department of Energy is adopting today require testing a
minimum sample of 20 lamps. The manufacturer must randomly select three lamps per month for any 7 of the 12 months required
to determine the average. If there are less than 7 months' production, the manufacturer may divide the minimum sample
of 20 as evenly as possible into each month of production. The provision for less than 7 month's production is to cover
production runs of special or limited lamps which are subject to regulation. 

The same sample of 20 lamps which were used for lamp efficacy testing shall be used for measurement of the Color Rendering
Index. The Department believes that this testing requirement will satisfy the standard which calls for lamp efficacy
and color rendering index measurements. 

The Department believes these provisions promote the objectives of the Act while minimizing the burden on manufacturers.
Manufacturers and other interested persons are encouraged to comment on this sampling approach, as well as the underlying
assumptions.

G. Laboratory Accreditation 



The Act at section 323(b)(6), directs DOE to prescribe test procedures which must be carried out by accredited test
laboratories. The Department herein defines an accredited laboratory as one which meets the standards and requirements
of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program, a division of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology of the United States Department of Commerce. Test laboratory accreditation by the National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program is based on conformance with criteria published in 15 CFR part 285 and in the National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program Handbook 150-01, ``Energy Efficient Lighting Products, Lamps
and Luminaires,'' August 1993. The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program Handbook 150-01
is available for inspection in the DOE reading room from 9 to 4, Monday through Friday or may be ordered from the National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program, Building 411, Room A162, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 

The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program has mutual recognition agreements with the following
countries: Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain. These agreements, with the aforesaid countries, allow
foreign test laboratories to be recognized by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program. The National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program will also directly accredit foreign test laboratories. Costs for laboratory
accreditation are borne by the test laboratory. 



H. Certification Data 



The Department is adding a new paragraph for lamp certification data at  430.62(a)(2). The lamp manufacturers'
certification report must include the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program identification number,
production date codes, lamp efficacy, Color Rendering Index, where applicable, lamp wattage, brand names and model
designation. Since lamps manufactured prior to the effective date of the standards may be in the distribution system
for some time, lamp manufacturers should advise DOE on how to interpret their production date coding system in the
certification report. All other requirements of  430.62 and Appendix A, Compliance Statement, also apply
to general service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps. 



I. Energy Conservation Standards 



The Act prescribes, and today's notice includes in  430.32, energy conservation standards for general service
fluorescent and incandescent reflector lamps. There are no standards for general service incandescent lamps or
medium base compact fluorescent lamps. 


J. Definitions 



By this notice, the Department of Energy is amending the definition of ``Act'' as it appears in  430.2. The amended
definition will include the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486). The legislated definitions for incandescent
lamp, general service incandescent lamp, fluorescent lamp, general service fluorescent lamp, and medium base compact
fluorescent lamp are included in  430.2. Note that there is an inconsistency in the Act between the definition
for ``fluorescent lamp'' and the definition for ``medium base compact fluorescent lamp.'' The definition for ``fluorescent
lamp'' 

only

 includes four lamp types and 

does not

 include a medium base compact fluorescent lamp. Faced with this conflict, the Department has included the definition
of ``medium base compact fluorescent lamp'' and has included test procedures as noted above. The Department has also
defined cold temperature lamp in  430.2 from an industry standard. 

The Act provides for an exemption from the standards for lamps specifically designed for cold temperature installations.
See  321(30)(B)(ii). The Department is defining ``cold temperature'' lamps as those lamps specifically designated
and marketed for outdoor or cold temperature use and that are designed to start at ^20
 F when used with a ballast conforming to the requirements of American National Standards Institute standard
C78.1. 

Lamps that meet these requirements would not be subject to standards. In order to qualify for the exemption, the lamps
must be ``specifically'' designed for cold temperature installations and must be specifically designated and marketed
as such in catalogs, sales literature and other promotional material. 



K. Prohibited Acts and Penalties 



Since the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), the enforcement
provisions may not be apparent. Therefore, the following statements reiterate the provisions from the Energy Policy
and Conservation Act in section 332 and the regulations at 10 CFR Section 430.61. The statute prohibits the following
actions: 

(1) For any manufacturer or private labeler to distribute in commerce any new covered product to which a rule under
section 324 applies, unless such covered product is labeled in accordance with such rule; 

(2) For any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler to remove from any new covered product or render
illegible any label required to be provided with such product under a rule under section 324; 

(3) For any manufacturer to fail to permit access to, or copying of, records required to be supplied under this part,
or fail to make reports or provide other information required to be supplied under this part; 

(4) For any person to fail to comply with an applicable requirement of section 326(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5); or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940928-0-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940928-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) for any manufacturer or private labeler to distribute in commerce any new covered product which is not in conformity
with an applicable energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this part. 
The maximum penalties are $100 for each violation. Each violation of (1), (2) and (5), above, shall constitute a separate
violation with respect to each covered product, and each day of violation of (3) and (4), above, shall constitute a
separate violation. 


III. Environmental Review 


Pursuant to section 7(c)(2) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-275), a copy of this
notice has been submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for comment concerning the
impact of this proposal on the quality of the environment. 
Since test procedures are used to standardize the measurement of energy usage, and will not affect the quality or distribution
of energy usage, prescribing test procedures will not result in any environmental impacts. The Department of Energy,
therefore, has determined that prescribing test procedures under the Program is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

This Rulemaking, which amends existing part 430 of title 10, will not change the environmental effect of such regulation,
and is an item which is ``categorically excluded (A6)'' by the Department of Energy's regulations on National Environmental
Policy Act Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021) (57 FR 15122, April 24, 1992) (Appendix A to subpart D, Categorical
Exclusion A6.). Consequently, neither an Environmental Impact Statement nor an Environmental Assessment is required
for this rule. 


IV. Regulatory Planning and Review 


Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 


V. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-345) (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires that an agency prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis and that it be published at the time the Interim Final Rule is published.
This requirement (which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency ``certifies that the rule will not, if
promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' This rule affects manufacturers
of general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps. As previously discussed, the test procedures would not have
significant economic impact, but rather, would provide common testing methods. Therefore, the Department of Energy
certifies that this rule, if promulgated, would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.'' 


VI. Federalism Review 


Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial
direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects,
then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in
promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule. 
The Department of Energy has identified a substantial direct effect that today's Interim Final Rule would have on
State governments. It would initially preempt inconsistent State regulations. However, the Department of Energy
has concluded that such effect is not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment for the following
reason: The Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption. Thus, a determination as to whether a State
law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set forth in the Act. When the Department of Energy
receives such a petition, it will then be appropriate to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with
the criteria in the Act.

VII. Review Under Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Authorization Act 


This notice of interim final rulemaking incorporates by reference Illuminating Engineering Society, American
National Standards Institute and International Commission on Illumination commercial test procedures to measure
the efficiency of general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps and the color rendering index of fluorescent
lamps. The commercial standards are Illuminating Engineering Society LM-9-1988, Illuminating Engineering
Society LM-16-1984, Illuminating Engineering Society LM-20-1983, Illuminating Engineering
Society LM-45-1991, Illuminating Engineering Society LM-58-1982, Illuminating Engineering
Society LM-1991, American National Standards Institute C78.1-1991, American National Standards Institute
C78.2-1978, American National Standards Institute C78.3-1991, American National Standards Institute
C78.375-1991, American National Standards Institute C82.3-1983, and International Commission on
Illumination Publication No. 13.2.-1974. 
Pursuant to section 301 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91), the Department of Energy
is required to comply with section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, as amended by section 9 of the
Federal Energy Administration Authorization Act of 1977. 15 U.S.C. 788. 
The findings required of the Department of Energy by section 32 serve to alert the public regarding the use and background
of commercial standards in a proposal and through the rulemaking process. They allow interested persons to make known
their views regarding the appropriateness of the use of any particular commercial standard in a notice of proposed
rulemaking. 
The Department of Energy has evaluated Illuminating Engineering Society LM-9, LM-16, LM-20, LM-45,
LM-58, LM-66, American National Standards Institute C78.1, C78.2, C78.3, C78.375, C82.3, and International
Commission on Illumination Publication No. 13.2 with regard to compliance with Section 32(b). The Department is
unable to conclude whether these standards fully complied with the requirements of section 32(b), i.e., that they
are developed in a manner which fully provided for public participation, comment, and review. 
As required by section 32(c), the Department of Energy will consult with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission concerning the impact of these standards on competition, prior to issuing a notice of Final
Rulemaking. 


VIII. Interim Final Effect 


The Interim Final Rule establishes the Department of Energy test procedures for general service fluorescent lamps,
general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and medium base compact fluorescent lamps incorporating
by reference industry standards. This Interim Final Rule allows the Department of Energy to promulgate test procedures
so that lamp manufacturers can meet the schedule imposed by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 123(f)(2). The normal
rulemaking process would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest because the process would not allow
for promulgation of a final rule in time for manufacturers to complete testing for certification. 
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires manufacturers to test lamps for a 12-month period preceding the date standards
are to take effect in order to certify that the lamps meet the standard. Section 123(f)(2). For two lamp types, the Energy
Policy Act specifies that the effective date for standards to take effect is April 30, 1994 and for others the effective
date is October 31, 1995. Section 123(f). Until a test procedure is prescribed, compliance with the standard cannot
be determined. This interim final rule will allow manufacturers to begin the 12-month testing period to determine
compliance with the standards. The Department could not practicably facilitate such a result if a proposed rule were
necessary. It is in the public interest to facilitate that result and therefore to issue this interim final regulation
without providing for public comment prior to giving them final effect. 5 U.S.C. 553. However, the Department of Energy
is providing for a post-publication public comment period and expects to respond to relevant comments in a notice
of Final Rulemaking.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final fair market rents. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs)
annually to be effective on October 1 of each year. FMRs are used for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part
882, subparts A and B), including space rentals by owners of manufactured homes under the Section 8 Rental Certificate
program (part 882, subpart F) and project-based Certificate assistance (part 882, subpart G); the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation program (part 882, subparts D and E); Section 8 housing assisted under part 886, subparts A and C (Section
8 Loan Management and Property Disposition programs); and to determine payment standard schedules in the Rental
Voucher program (part 887). 




HUD published the proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 FMRs in the 

Federal Register

 on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32492), and in another publication on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35739), announced that the public comment
period was extended to October 14, 1994. The public comment period was extended to give Public Housing Agencies (PHAs)
the opportunity to use the new rental housing survey guide that HUD had recently developed for smaller, nonmetropolitan
areas. 


Two separate sets of proposed FMRs were published on June 23_one based on the 45th percentile rent standard and the
other based on the 40th percentile rent standard. The authorization bill now moving through Congress establishes
FMRs at the 45th percentile rent standard. This notice, therefore, makes effective the final FY 1995 FMRs at the 45th
percentile level.

As announced in the 

Federal Register

 on July 13, there will be two final FY 1995 FMR publications. Today's notice makes effective final FMRs for all areas
on October 1, 1994. The FMRs in this notice are based on the proposed FMRs included in the June 23 notice for all areas
except eight with RDD and AHS surveys that will have proposed reductions in their FMRs postponed pending the outcome
of the review of comments submitted (see AHS and RDD surveys). A second publication later this year will announce revised
final FMRs for the areas for which HUD makes a determination that the rental housing surveys submitted as public comments
provided a sufficient basis for such revision. 





<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f) authorizes housing assistance to aid
lower income families in renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Assistance payments are limited by FMRs established
by HUD for different areas. In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to pay the gross rent (shelter
rent plus utilities) of privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature
with suitable amenities. 




Method Used to Develop FMRs 






FMR Standard: 

The FMRs are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent and the cost of utilities, except telephone. HUD sets
FMRs to assure that a sufficient supply of rental housing is available to program participants. To accomplish this
objective, FMRs must be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods and low enough to serve as
many families as possible. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution
of standard quality rental housing units. The current definition used is the 45th percentile rent, the dollar amount
below which 45 percent of the standard quality rental housing units rent. The 45th percentile rent is drawn from the
distribution of rents of units which are occupied by recent movers (renter households who moved into their unit within
the past 15 months). Public housing units and newly built units less than two years old are excluded. 




Data Sources: 

HUD used the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates. Three sources of survey data were
used for the base-year estimates. They are: (1) The 1990 Census; (2) RDD telephone surveys conducted of individual
FMR areas since the 1990 Census; and (3) the post-1990 Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) available at the time
the FMR estimates were prepared. The base-year FMRs were then updated using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents
and utilities or the HUD regional rent change factors developed from RDD surveys. Annual average CPI data are available
individually for 103 metropolitan FMR areas. RDD Regional rent change factors are developed annually for the metropolitan
and nonmetropolitan parts of each of the 10 HUD regions (a total of 20 separate factors). The RDD factors are used to
update the base year estimates for all FMR areas that do not have their own local CPI survey. 


The decennial Census provides statistically reliable rent data for use in establishing base-year FMRs. AHSs are
conducted by the Bureau of the Census for HUD and have accuracy comparable to the decennial Census. These surveys enable
HUD to develop between-census revisions for the largest metropolitan areas on a revolving schedule. The RDD telephone
survey technique is based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select random samples of rental housing,
dial and keep track of the telephone numbers and tabulate the responses. 




Manufactured Home Space FMRs: 

The final manufactured home space FMRs are established at 30 percent of the applicable Section 8 Rental Certificate
program two-bedroom FMR. HUD accepts public comments requesting modifications of manufactured home space FMRs.
To be accepted for approval, such comments must contain statistically valid survey data that show the 45th percentile
space rent (excluding the cost of utilities) for the FMR area. This program uses the same FMR area definitions as the
Section 8 Rental Certificate program. All manufactured home space FMR revisions approved will be published as final
FMRs in Schedule D. In addition HUD has retained all of the modifications approved since 1990 because they are based
on recent survey data that HUD had determined to be valid. 




New Metropolitan Area 




This publication makes final the FMRs for the newly designated Hattiesburg, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical
Area (MSA), which was defined by OMB on July 1, 1994 (OMB Bulletin 94-07) to include Forrest and Lamar Counties.
HUD has determined that the new metropolitan area definition is appropriate for use as an FMR area definition. 




AHS and RDD Surveys 




The eight areas identified in the proposed FMR notice with reduced FMRs resulting from RDD and AHS surveys will continue
to use the FY 1994 FMRs, which are republished in this notice. Final FY 1995 FMRs for these areas, including any revisions
resulting from public comments, will be included in the second publication later this year. The eight areas are: 









RDD AREAS



Gage County, NE

Holmes County, FL

Jamestown, NY, MSA

Las Cruces, NM, MSA

Reading, PA, MSA

Washington County, FL 





AHS AREAS




Memphis, TN-AR-MS, MSA

Oklahoma City, OK, MSA

HUD Rental Housing Survey Guides 



HUD continues to recommend use of professionally-conducted Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys to test
the accuracy of FMRs for areas where there is a sufficient number of Section 8 units to justify the survey cost of $10,000-$12,000.
Areas with 500 or more units usually meet this criterion, and areas with fewer units may meet it if the actual two-bedroom
FMR rent standard is significantly different than that proposed by HUD. In addition, HUD has developed a simplified
version of the RDD survey methodology for smaller, non-metropolitan PHAs. This methodology is designed to be simple
enough to be done by the PHA itself, rather than by professional survey organizations, at a cost of around $5,000. The
smallest PHAs may, in certain circumstances, do surveys of clusters of counties. All clustered surveys must be approved
in advance by HUD. PHAs are cautioned that the resultant FMRs will not be identical within the cluster_e.g., each individual
FMR area will have a separate FMR based on its relationship to the combined rent of the cluster of FMR areas. HUD does
not mandate the use of either the RDD telephone survey or the modified RDD telephone survey methodology. Other survey
methodologies are acceptable as long as they provide statistically reliable unbiased estimates of the 45th percentile
gross rent. All survey results must be fully documented. 

Because it takes two months to obtain survey estimates, interested organizations concerned about FMR accuracy may
wish to begin their FMR surveys in the next few months to assure that the results will be available in time to be incorporated
into the FY 1996 FMRs. The starting point is to carefully review one of the two following publications, both obtainable
from HUD USER at 1-800-245-2691. Larger PHAs should obtain ``Random Digit Dialing Surveys; A Guide
to Assist Larger Public Housing Agencies in Preparing Fair Market Rent Comments.'' Smaller PHAs should obtain ``Rental
Housing Surveys; A Guide to Assist Smaller Public Housing Agencies in Preparing Fair Market Rent Comments.'' 



FMRs for Flood Damaged Areas in the Southeast and Midwest



Under the authority granted in 24 CFR part 899, the Secretary finds good cause to waive the regulatory requirements
that govern requests for geographic area FMR exceptions for the flood-impacted areas in the midwest and southeast
that have been declared Federal disaster areas. The FMR areas eligible for exceptions are those declared Federal
disaster areas. Recognizing that the substantial losses resulting from the floods will have a direct effect on local
rent levels, HUD is prepared to grant FMR exceptions up to 10 percent above the final FY 1995 FMRs for single-county
FMR areas and for individual county parts of multi-county FMR areas. The flood-related FMR exceptions will be approved
by the HUD field office with jurisdiction for: (1) Counties that qualify as disaster areas under the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; if (2) the PHA certifies that damage to the rental housing stock is so
substantial that it has increased the prevailing rent levels. Such exceptions must be requested in writing by the
responsible PHAs. Once approved by HUD, they will remain in effect until superseded by final FY 1996 FMRs. 



Other Matters 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment as required by the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4374) is unnecessary, since the Section 8 Rental Certificate program is categorically
excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(d). 

The undersigned, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), hereby certifies that this
notice does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs do not change
the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not in the Section 8 program. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that
this notice will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The notice amends
Fair Market Rent schedules for various Section 8 assisted housing programs, and does not affect the amount of rent
a family receiving rental assistance pays, which is based on a percentage of the family's income. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism,

 has determined that this notice will not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does
not have Federalism implications. The Fair Market Rent schedules do not have any substantial direct impact on States,
on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibility
among the various levels of government. 

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.156, Lower-Income Housing Assistance Program (section
8). 

Accordingly, the Fair Market Rent Schedules, which will not be codified in 24 CFR Part 888, are amended as follows:

Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program; Fair Market Rent Schedules for Use in the Rental Certificate Program,
Loan Management and Property Disposition Programs, Moderate Rehabilitation Program and Rental Voucher Program




Schedules B and D_General Explanatory Notes 



1. Geographic Coverage 



a. The FMRs shown in Schedule B incorporate the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) most current definitions of
metropolitan areas (with the exceptions discussed in paragraph b). HUD uses the OMB Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA) and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA) definitions for FMR areas because they closely correspond
to housing market area definitions. FMRs are housing market-wide rent estimates that are intended to provide housing
opportunities throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in direct competition. 

b. The exceptions are counties which have been deleted from seven large metropolitan areas whose revised OMB definitions
were determined by HUD to be larger than the housing market areas. The FMRs for the following counties (shown by the
metropolitan area) are calculated separately and are shown in Schedule B within their respective States under the
``Metropolitan FMR Areas'' listing: 



Metropolitan Area and Counties Deleted 



Atlanta, GA_Carroll, Pickens, Spalding, and Walton Counties. 

Chicago, IL_DeKalb, Grundy and Kendall Counties. 

Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-IN_Brown County, Ohio; Gallatin, Grant and Pendleton Counties in Kentucky;
and Ohio County, Indiana. 

Dallas, TX_Henderson County. 

Lafayette, LA_St. Landry and Acadia Parishes. 

New Orleans, LA_St. James Parish. 

Washington, DC_Berkeley and Jefferson Counties in West Virginia; and Clarke, Culpeper, King George and Warren counties
in Virginia.

 


c. FMRs also are established for nonmetropolitan counties and for county equivalents in the United States, for nonmetropolitan
parts of counties in the New England states and for FMR areas in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Pacific Islands.


d. FMRs for the areas in Virginia shown in the table below were established by combining the Census data for the nonmetropolitan
counties with the data for the independent cities that are located within the county borders. Because of space limitations,
the FMR listing in Schedule B includes only the name of the nonmetropolitan county. The full definitions of these areas
including the independent cities are as follows: 




 

e. FMRs for Section 8 manufactured home spaces are established at 30 percent of the two-bedroom Section 8 Rental Certificate
program FMRs, with the exception of the areas listed in Schedule D whose FMRs have been modified on the basis of public
comments. The FMR area definitions used for manufactured home spaces are the same as for the Section 8 Certificate
program. 



2. Arrangement of FMR Areas and Identification of Constituent Parts 



a. The FMR areas in Schedule B are listed alphabetically by metropolitan FMR area and by nonmetropolitan county within
each State. The exception FMRs for manufactured home spaces in Schedule D are listed alphabetically by State. 

b. The constituent counties (and New England towns and cities) included in each metropolitan FMR area are listed immediately
following the listings of the FMR dollar amounts. All constituent parts of a metropolitan FMR area that are in more
than one State can be identified by consulting the listings for each applicable State. 

c. Two nonmetropolitan counties are listed alphabetically on each line of the nonmetropolitan county listings.


d. The New England towns and cities included in a nonmetropolitan part of a county are listed immediately following
the county name. 

e. The FMRs are listed by dollar amount on the first line beginning with the FMR area name.

SUMMARY:

 The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') adds pool heaters, 
instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters to the list of products covered by 
the Commission's Appliance Labeling Rule (``Rule''). This action is being taken because 
amendments to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``EPCA'') added pool heaters to the 
list of covered products for which the Commission must consider labeling requirements, and 
because the Department of Energy (``DOE'') promulgated final test procedures for the two 
types of water heaters at issue that triggered an obligation under EPCA for the Commission to 
consider labeling requirements for them.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



A. Statutory Authority for Labeling Pool Heaters, Instantaneous Water 
 Heaters, and Heat Pump Water Heaters 



The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (``NAECA 87'')
 amended EPCA
 
by, among other things, adding pool heaters (which include spa and hot tub heaters and 
heaters for similar applications_for convenience, the Commission will refer to these 
products as ``pool heaters'') to the list of appliances for which DOE must establish minimum 
efficiency standards and testing procedures. EPCA requires the Commission to consider 
labeling requirements for any covered products for which DOE has prescribed a final test 
procedure.
 







NAECA 87 also amended EPCA by adding definitions, in section 321,
 for some of 
the products enumerated as ``covered products'' in section 322,
 including a definition for 
water heaters that subdivided the category into three subcategories_storage-type units, 
instantaneous units, and heat pump units.
 In 1989, DOE amended its definition for water 
heaters to be consistent with the NAECA 87 amendments,
 and, in 1990, refined its test procedure for water heaters so it would apply to some (but not all) of the different kinds
of 
instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters that are currently being produced, as 
well as to storage-type units.
 Previously, DOE's definition (and test procedure) for water 
heaters applied only to conventional storage-type heaters. The Commission's current labeling 
Rule, like the previous version of the DOE rule, defines water heaters only as storage-type 
units.
 Thus, these other products did not come within the Rule's definition of water heater. 










EPCA provides that, after DOE prescribes a final test procedure applicable to a 
product category covered under EPCA,
 the Commission must initiate a proceeding to 
consider labeling requirements for that category. Because of DOE's publication of a final test 
procedure for pool heaters, the Commission commenced a proceeding to consider labeling 
rules for pool heaters. Further, because DOE amended its definition for water heaters in 
section 430.2 of Subpart A (General Provisions) of its rules,
 to include instantaneous water 
heaters and heat pump water heaters, and amended Appendix E to Subpart B of Part 430_
the test procedure for these products_so the energy usage of most of these new products can 
be determined, the Commission also initiated a proceeding to consider requiring labeling for these water heaters.







B. Regulatory History 



On February 9, 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the 

Federal Register

 soliciting comment on a proposal to require EnergyGuide labels on pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and
heat pump water heaters.
 As required by EPCA,
 this rulemaking was conducted pursuant to section 553 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'').
 Section 553(b)(3) of the APA provides the 
Commission with the option of publishing the substance of a proposed rule instead of specific 
proposed rule language. The Commission exercised this option and sought comment on the 
substance of the proposed amendments to the Rule, except for specific definitions for each of 
the proposed new product categories. 







In accordance with EPCA,
 the NPR afforded interested persons the opportunity to 
present their views in writing and orally at a public hearing. The Presiding Officer did not 
receive any requests for an oral presentation, so no hearing was held. During the comment 
period, which extended from February 9 through April 26, 1993, the Commission received 
eight comments.
 These comments are from two appliance manufacturers, one appliance 
industry trade association, two public utilities, one utility trade association, one state energy 
office, and one public interest group.
 Part II, below, discusses the issues on which 
comments were sought, the comments received, and the amendments the Commission is 
adopting today in response to them. The amended Rule sections appear in ``Text of 
Amendments.''

In the NPR, the Commission initially concluded that the provisions of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act relating to an initial Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis were not applicable to 
the proceeding and that a regulatory analysis was not necessary because the amendments, if 
promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The NPR sought comment, however, on the effects of the proposed amendments on 
small businesses to assist the Commission in determining whether a final Regulatory 
Flexibility Act analysis was necessary.
 The Commission also initially concluded that, 
although the proposed amendments would expand the Rule's existing recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements to include manufacturers of products not covered before, the effect 
would be 

de minimis

 because so few companies would be affected and the resulting increase 
in burden hours would be so small. The Commission decided, therefore, not to ask the Office 
of Management and Budget to adjust the clearance for the Rule under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. To substantiate the accuracy of its reporting burden estimate, however, the 
Commission requested comment on the extent of the reporting burden associated with these 
amendments.
 Parts III and IV, below, discuss the comments on these issues and the 
Commission's final determinations with respect to the requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, respectively. 







II. Discussion of Comments and Disposition of Issues 



As discussed in more detail in Parts II.A and B, below, the NPR proposed definitions 
for each of the three product categories that are based on EPCA and/or Part 430 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (``CFR''), which is the section of CFR in which DOE's test procedures 
are codified. In addition, the NPR solicited comment with respect to each category regarding: 
the feasibility of labeling the product; the appropriateness of the proposed definition; what 
energy usage descriptor to require on the labels; what sub-categories, if any, to establish for 
purposes of ranges of comparability; and, what format to require for the labels.

A. Pool Heaters 



1. Feasibility of Labeling 



The Commission is required to prescribe a labeling rule for the categories of products 
listed in EPCA,
 which now include pool heaters, unless it determines that labeling the 
product is ``not technologically or economically feasible.''
 The NPR asked for comment on 
this issue, emphasizing that the question was whether 

labeling

 pool heaters would be 
economically or technologically infeasible (as distinct from testing, which manufacturers and 
importers must do in order to comply with DOE's minimum efficiency standards program).
 








Three comments addressed this issue. CEC stated that labeling these products is both 
economically and technologically feasible and that the value to consumers of the label 
information greatly outweighs the labeling cost to industry. CEC pointed out that 
manufacturers currently provide energy efficiency information on pool heaters to DOE and 
CEC, but not to the purchaser.
 ACEEE and ALG also supported labeling requirements for 
pool heaters without elaboration.
 The record does not indicate that labeling of pool heaters 
would be technologically or economically infeasible. Accordingly, the Commission has 
determined to amend the Rule to include labeling requirements for the pool heater category. 









2. Definition for ``Pool Heater'' 



The NPR explained that the EPCA/DOE definition of pool heaters is not limited to 
products of any particular fuel type.
 The DOE test, however, covers only gas- and oil-fired products.
 Although the majority of pool heaters are currently gas-fired (with some 
oil-fired), electric resistance and heat pump pool heaters are also being manufactured. 
Because the DOE test covers only gas- and oil-fired pool heaters, the NPR proposed 
amending the Rule to cover only these two types of products. The Rule's coverage is 
necessarily limited by the definitions and test procedures in Subpart B of DOE's rules (

i.e.,

 in 
the absence of a DOE test procedure for determining energy usage, compliance with the Rule 
is impossible). The NPR proposed, therefore, adopting the EPCA/DOE definition of ``pool 
heater'' along with a proviso stating that the Rule's scope is limited to those products within 
the definition for which there is a DOE-prescribed test for measuring energy usage. 






Two comments addressed the proposed definition. ACEEE stated that the Commission's adoption of the definition in
section 430.2 of DOE's rule with the proposed proviso would be acceptable.
 CEC agreed that the Rule should be amended to include the language in section 430.2, but opposed the addition of the
proviso, stating that DOE has developed, but not yet published, an all-inclusive test method, and that the American
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (``ASHRAE'') has appointed a committee to develop
a test for gas, oil, electric, and heat pump pool heaters.







The Commission has determined to amend the Rule to include the definition of pool 
heaters as that term is defined in EPCA and by DOE (in section 430.2 of Subpart A). The 
definition is followed by a proviso stating that the Rule's application is limited to those 
products for which there is a DOE-prescribed test. See section 305.3(o) in ``Text of 
Amendments,'' below. The Commission recognizes, as CEC pointed out, that there may 
eventually be a test procedure for all types of these products. However, the Commission's 
authority here to require labels is limited to products for which DOE has published final test 
procedures. If DOE amends the test procedure to include electric resistance and/or heat pump 
pool heaters, the Commission will then initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether 
the Rule should be amended to cover those products.

3. Energy Usage Descriptor 



EPCA requires that labels on covered products disclose estimated annual operating 
cost, as determined by DOE test procedures, unless DOE determines that disclosure of 
estimated annual operating costs is not technologically feasible, or the Commission 
determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing 
decisions or is not economically feasible. In this event, the Commission shall require 
disclosure of a different useful measure of energy consumption, again determined in 
accordance with DOE test procedures.

30

 Labels also must disclose the range of estimated 
annual operating costs, or the alternate measure of energy consumption required for those 
covered products.

31

 






A disclosure of estimated annual operating cost is not appropriate, however, for all 
product categories. For example, three product categories (room air conditioners, furnaces, 
central air conditioners) have usage cycles that depend on disparate climate conditions across 
the United States. In past rulemaking proceedings, the Commission has determined for these 
products that ``average'' energy cost would not be likely to assist consumers in making 
purchasing decisions. Therefore, the required disclosure on labels for these products is an 
energy efficiency rating (``EER'').

32

 The corresponding cost information also must be 
disclosed on the label for room air conditioners, and on fact sheets or in an industry directory 
for furnaces and central air conditioners. 





The energy efficiency measurement in EPCA that applies to pool heaters is ``thermal 
efficiency.''

33

 This measurement is also the energy usage descriptor that is derived from the 
DOE test procedure.

34

 The current DOE test has no methodology for deriving estimated 
annual operating cost or any energy usage measurement other than thermal efficiency. To 
obtain information about what possible current or future disclosures may be appropriate for 
labels on pool heaters, the NPR solicited comment on whether the measure of energy 
consumption to be disclosed on pool heater labels should be thermal efficiency, without 
additional cost information, or whether it should be some other disclosure. Because DOE 
might amend its test procedure to include a way to measure annual energy consumption (and, 
therefore, cost), the NPR also asked whether it would be technically or economically feasible 
to disclose estimated annual operating cost, and whether operating cost information would be 
likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.

35

 







There was little agreement on these issues among the four comments that addressed 
them. Washington Gas stated that estimated annual operating cost is difficult to measure 
because the usage of pool heaters varies from region to region and depends on consumers' 
preferences. It recommended requiring a disclosure of hourly energy consumption along with 
thermal efficiency for comparison with other heaters.

36

 CEC recommended requiring a 
disclosure of both thermal efficiency and estimated annual operating cost. AGA and ALG 
favored the disclosure of estimated annual operating cost.
 Both expressed concern that 
thermal efficiency alone could mislead consumers because the different costs of operation 
between fuels would not appear on the label.

38

 







As noted above, the DOE test for pool heaters does not currently contain a final 
procedure for measuring estimated annual operating cost for these products, so the 
Commission cannot now require disclosure of operating cost. In the absence of such a 
procedure, the Commission determines that the most useful information available for 
consumers is thermal efficiency. Accordingly, the Commission amends the Rule to require 
that thermal efficiency be disclosed as the energy usage descriptor for these products. See 
sections 305.2(i) and 305.11(a)(5)(ii)(C)-(E) and (G) of ``Text of Amendments,'' below. If, 
and when, DOE amends its test procedure to contain provisions for the determination of 
estimated annual operating cost, the Commission might consider amending the Rule to require 
the disclosure of estimated annual operating cost.

4. Sub-Categories for Ranges of Comparability 



Under the Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show, in addition to 
the energy usage of the appliance itself, a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs 
or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. To 
accomplish this, the Rule contains appendices that list sub-categories for each product 
category divided by fuel type and capacity groupings.

39

 





NAECA 87 established a minimum efficiency standard for pool heaters, but it did not 
create any size or capacity sub-category beyond ``pool heaters.''

40

 The DOE standard also 
does not create sub-categories.

41

 The NPR solicited information on whether, for purposes of 
ranges of comparability under the Commission's Rule, there should be one category 
encompassing both fuel types, or two categories, one for each of the two fuel types_oil-fired and gas-fired models_for
which there is currently an applicable DOE test procedure. 






One comment addressed this question. CEC suggested that gas- and oil-fired pool 
heaters are sufficiently similar to be included in one group.

42

 The Commission agrees that 
gas- and oil-fired pool heaters are similar from a minimum efficiency standards perspective 
(the standard is the same for both_a thermal efficiency of no less than 78%). However, 
since 1980, the Commission has grouped products by different fuel types for purposes of the 
ranges of comparability. The Commission finds that this is the clearest and most informative 
way of presenting the ranges to consumers. Accordingly, the Commission amends the Rule 
to include separate ranges of comparability for gas-fired and oil-fired pool heaters. See 
revised Appendices J1 and J2 in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 





5. Label Format 



The Commission recognizes that pool heaters are sometimes not seen by consumers 
before purchase. They are often purchased as the result of a pool installation professional's 
recommendation and are ordered from industry brochures or specification sheets. The NPR, 
therefore, solicited comment on whether amendments requiring labels for pool heaters should 
require a ``conventional'' product-specific label approach for these products or another labeling 
format. ``Conventional'' product-specific labels contain all the required energy use information 
and are used for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, water heaters, dishwashers, 
clothes washers, and room air conditioners.

43

 The NPR also asked for comment on whether 
it would be more useful to require that pool heaters be labeled with a label like the one 
required for central air conditioners. For these products, the Commission requires a product-specific label, but
with only some of the required energy usage information. Other required 
information must be disclosed on separate fact sheets or in an industry-produced directory.

44








Two comments addressed the issue of label type and format. CEC favored a 
conventional label for pool heaters.

45

 ACEEE suggested a simplified label with a 
requirement for disclosure of comprehensive information on a fact sheet, in an industry 
directory, or in marketing materials.

46

 As discussed in Part II.A.3, above, the only measure 
of energy usage that can be derived through the current DOE test for these products is 
thermal efficiency. Therefore, requiring manufacturers to disclose ``other information'' 
through other formats would be inappropriate. Moreover, without a method for determining 
estimated annual operating cost, the Commission cannot require the ``Operating Cost 
Statement'' that is standard on ``conventional'' labels. Consequently, the Commission is 
amending the Rule to require that labels for pool heaters disclose the thermal efficiency of the 
product in the format of the ``conventional'' label for room air conditioners, but without the 
``Operating Cost Statement.'' See the Sample Label for pool heaters in ``Text of 
Amendments,'' below.

B. Instantaneous Water Heaters and Heat Pump Water Heaters 



Instantaneous water heaters heat water as it is needed, rather than heating it in a tank and keeping it hot while storing
it. An advantage to this approach to water heating is that there is no standby loss with the associated increased cost
and loss of efficiency.

47

 Instantaneous water heaters can heat water by means of oil, natural gas, or electric resistance, although there are
few, if any, oil-fired instantaneous water heaters in production. The DOE test procedure presently contains test
methodologies only for gas- and oil-fired models and not for electric.

48

 






Heat pump water heaters are similar to small room air conditioners. They extract heat from the air around them but,
instead of exhausting it to the outside, they use the heat to increase the temperature of the water in a conventional
storage tank. They exhaust the resulting cool air into the surrounding area. 



1. Feasibility of Labeling 



The NPR asked whether labeling (as distinct from testing) instantaneous and heat pump water heaters would be economically
or technologically infeasible.

49

 Five comments addressed this issue. Washington Gas recommended deferring consideration of labeling heat pump water
heaters until more information is available on the effects that the climate conditioning of the space around the heat
pump water heater have on the product's energy consumption.

50

 The other four comments favored requiring EnergyGuide labels on both types of water heaters.

51

 GAMA repeated its consistent position that labeling of all water heaters, including instantaneous water heaters
and heat pump water heaters, is not technologically infeasible, but is of little benefit to consumers because water
heaters are not usually purchased off a showroom floor. GAMA acknowledged, however, that if the requirement to label
storage water heaters is to continue, then instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters also should be
labeled.

52

 CEC, ACEEE, and ALG all favored a labeling requirement for both types of water heaters without qualification.

53

 









The record does not indicate that labeling for these products is technologically or economically infeasible. Most
comments instead favored treating these water heaters like the type already covered by the Rule. Accordingly, the
Commission amends the Rule to require EnergyGuide labels for instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters.
See section 
305.3(d) of ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 



2. Revised Definition of ``Water Heater,'' Including Definitions for 
Instantaneous Water Heaters and Heat Pump Water Heaters 



The NPR proposed amending the Rule to include the definitions for instantaneous water heater and heat pump water heater
that appear in section 430.2 of DOE's rule, but with a proviso, like the one proposed for pool heaters, stating that
the Rule's requirements are limited to those products for which there are DOE-prescribed test procedures.

54

 The definition in section 430.2 of DOE's rule is supplemented in the test procedure portions of DOE's rule (Appendix
E to Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 430). In the NPR, the Commission reasoned that the proposed approach would allow the Commission
to avoid repeating the definition limitations in DOE's Appendix E to Subpart B, as well as limitations inherent in
the way the test procedure itself is written (for example, by the fact that the DOE test procedure presently does not
contain a procedure for measuring the energy usage of electric instantaneous water heaters.)

55

 






Five comments addressed the proposed definition. ACEEE stated that the Commission's adoption of the definition
in section 430.2 of DOE's rule with the proposed proviso would be acceptable.

56

 GAMA also favored adopting the section 430.2 definition and proviso.

57

 CEC stated that the Rule should be amended to include the language in section 430.2, but opposed the addition of the
proviso, stating that DOE has developed, but not yet published, an all-inclusive test method.

58

 Paloma requested the Commission to adopt the definition for gas instantaneous water heaters from Appendix E rather
than from section 430.2, because the Appendix E definition limits the size of the products to be covered.

59

 Washington Gas stated that instantaneous water heaters are used with and without a storage tank, and that the minimum
flow rate of an instantaneous water heater should be defined if it is to be used without a storage tank.

As with pool heaters, the Commission finds that the EPCA/DOE definition for these products appropriately describes
the product to be covered by the labeling requirements. Therefore, the Commission amends the Rule to include the definition
of water heaters as they are defined in EPCA and by DOE (in  430.2 of Subpart A). The definition is followed by a
proviso stating that the Rule's application is limited to those products for which there is 
a DOE-prescribed test. See section 305.3(d) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 

As with pool heaters, the Commission believes that a proviso of this type is more efficient than repeating, in the Rule's
product definition, the further exceptions and limitations in the Appendix E definitions and/or the test procedure.

61

 Products not covered by the DOE test because of the limitations in the Appendix E definitions cannot be tested. To comply
with the Commission's Rule, a manufacturer must be able to measure a product's energy usage in accordance with the
appropriate DOE test procedure.

62

 Identifying specific limitations to the general definition in the Commission's Rule based on section 430.2 of DOE's
rule is not necessary because manufacturers are on notice that water heaters excluded from DOE test coverage do not
have to be labeled under the Commission's Rule. 






3. Energy Usage Descriptor 



The NPR asked whether the energy usage of instantaneous and heat pump water heaters should be expressed as an estimated
annual operating cost, as it was at that time for conventional water heaters, or whether their energy usage should
be expressed as an energy factor. The NPR also asked whether it would be technically or economically feasible to disclose
estimated annual operating cost, or whether operating cost would not be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing
decisions.

63







Six comments addressed the issue of which energy usage descriptor to require on labels for these two types of water
heaters. Paloma, commenting only on instantaneous water heaters, recommended that the Rule require the disclosure
of an energy factor for gas instantaneous water heaters.

64

 Washington Gas suggested the disclosure of estimated annual operating cost for both types of water heaters, but with
special considerations that are not contemplated by the DOE test procedure.

65

The four other comments addressed both categories. GAMA and ACEEE stated that 
the same descriptor should be required for instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water 
heaters that is required for storage water heaters.
 AGA commented that, if pool heaters, 
instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters are to be labeled, the required 
disclosure should be the estimated annual operating cost.
 CEC recommended that the 
Commission require energy factor, annual energy consumption, and annual cost of operation 
disclosures. CEC stated that the energy factor is needed because this is the measure upon 
which utility incentive programs are based, and that annual energy consumption and annual 
cost of operation are needed ``to fulfill FTC's Congressional mandate.''







The Commission agrees with GAMA and ACEEE that the energy usage of 
instantaneous and heat pump water heaters should be expressed with the same descriptor 
(estimated annual energy consumption) that is used to disclose the energy usage of the 
storage-type water heaters currently covered by the Rule. This permits consumers to compare 
the energy usage of the various types of water heaters that could fulfill their needs. 
Accordingly, today's amendments will incorporate instantaneous water heaters and heat pump 
water heaters into the existing requirements to disclose estimated annual energy consumption. 
See section 305.3(d) of ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 
 

4. Sub-categories for Ranges of Comparability 
 

The NPR solicited comment about whether to include instantaneous water heaters in 
the three existing water heater ranges (one range each for electric, gas [including propane] 
and oil water heaters), or to establish a separate range category. The current ranges of 
comparability for water heaters are categorized on the basis of first-hour rating.
 Under the 
DOE test, there is a method for calculating the equivalent of a first-hour rating for 
instantaneous water heaters. Therefore, these products could be included in the existing 
ranges and could be considered with conventional water heaters for range purposes. Because 
they have no storage tanks, however, and are different from conventional water heaters, the 
NPR sought public comment on whether a separate category would be more helpful to 
consumers than including these products in the existing water heater ranges. 




The DOE test also contains a provision by which a first-hour rating for heat pump 
water heaters can be calculated. Like instantaneous water heaters, therefore, heat pump water 
heaters could be included in the conventional water heater ranges. The NPR sought comment 
on whether it would be more helpful to consumers to include heat pump water heaters with 
conventional water heaters or to create a separate range category for them. 
 Four commenters addressed the issue of range subcategories for these products. Paloma 
contended that gas instantaneous water heaters are so different from storage-type water 
heaters that they should be in a separate range category.
 GAMA and ACEEE stated, 
without elaboration, that instantaneous water heaters should be in the same range category as 
conventional storage water heaters.
 ACEEE thought that heat pump water heaters should 
be in the same range category as storage-type water heaters, but GAMA and CEC disagreed, 
recommending that they be in a separate range category.







The Commission is creating separate sub-categories for each of these two types of 
water heaters, rather than including them in the existing ranges of comparability for water 
heaters. As noted in the comments, the technology of instantaneous and heat pump water 
heaters is different from that of storage-type water heaters. In addition, it is not likely that 
homeowners would substitute these new types of products ``one-to-one'' for conventional, 
storage-type units.
 The Commission has determined that it would be helpful for consumers 
looking for alternatives to conventional storage-type water heaters to have products using 
different technologies grouped separately. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to 
amend the Rule to create three new range sub-categories_one each for gas instantaneous 
water heaters (natural gas and propane), oil instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water 
heaters. See Appendices D4-D6 in ``Text of Amendments,'' below.

5. Label Size and Format for Instantaneous Water Heaters 


The NPR noted that, because the physical size of gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
 (they are often no larger than one to three cubic feet) is usually significantly smaller than 
 most storage-type water heaters, the currently required 5 and 5/16 inches by 7 and 3/8 inches 
 label could be too large to fit on some of the smaller models.
 There is also the possibility 
 that the surface temperature of the products could affect label adhesion. The NPR requested 
 comment on whether the EnergyGuide label currently required for water heaters is appropriate 
 for instantaneous water heaters and, if not, what would be better.






Four comments responded to this request. Paloma contended that labeling on the front 
jacket of instantaneous water heaters is impossible because of the room taken up by other 
required labels and is, therefore, technologically infeasible. Paloma also contended that, 
because of the product's surface temperature, a paper label would be inappropriate. Paloma 
concluded that, under the circumstances, an aluminum label with special adhesive would be 
necessary, which would be an economic burden. Paloma recommended, therefore, a tag-type 
label.
 GAMA and CEC stated that the conventional label that is currently required would 
be appropriate for most models. Both commented that the issue of surface temperature is 
irrelevant because EnergyGuides are required on products only until they are sold, which 
would be before the water heater was fired for the first time. GAMA recommended allowing 
a hang-tag type label, as did Washington Gas.
 





The Commission agrees with the comments that both conventional label types (

i.e., 

paper, rather than aluminum) and hang-tag type labels will be appropriate for instantaneous 
water heaters. Hang-tags may be preferable in some instances, such as when the 
instantaneous heater is too small to accommodate conventional labels. Section 305.11(a)(7) 
of the Rule currently allows for the use of hang-tags as long as they are affixed in such a way 
that they will be prominent to a consumer examining the product. Therefore, the Rule 
permits manufacturers of instantaneous and heat pump water heaters to exercise the hang-tag 
option. 


6. Disclosure of Tank Size on Label for Heat Pump Water Heaters 


Heat pump water heaters are marketed in two ways. They can be sold as an integral 
unit that includes the heat pump and the storage tank, or they can be sold without a tank and 
hooked up with an existing water heater with the conventional heating system shut off. For 
those instances in which the heat pump water heater is sold without a tank, the DOE test calls 
for measurement of energy use with the heat pump water heater connected to a 47-gallon 
capacity storage tank. Thus, even when no tank is to be sold with the heat pump water 
heater, manufacturers will be able to determine the energy use figure to put on the label for 
comparative shopping purposes. The product's efficiency, however, could be affected by the 
size of the tank with which it is coupled. The NPR solicited comment, therefore, on whether 
the label should include a statement that determination of the heat pump water heater's 
efficiency is based on use with a 47-gallon tank and that its efficiency in the home may vary 
according to the size of the storage tank to which it is connected. 
Two comments addressed this issue. CEC stated that the statement that the efficiency 
of heat pump water heaters could be affected by the size of the tank with which it is coupled 
is only necessary in the case where the manufacturer does not supply the tank. CEC 
recommended that, in this case, the label should identify the size of the tank assumed for 
purposes of determining the energy factor.
 GAMA stated that the 

standby loss 

of the tank, 
not its 

size

, is what is relevant. Thus, heat pump water heater labels should not state that the 
efficiency of the water heater could be affected by the size of the tank with which it is coupled. GAMA also contended
that, given the limited ranges of sizes and standby losses of 
tanks coupled with heat pump water heaters, such a statement on the EnergyGuide would not 
be worthwhile from a consumer benefit standpoint.






The Commission agrees with GAMA that the effect on energy consumption will not 
be significant enough to require a disclosure on the EnergyGuide label. Thus, the 
Commission has determined not to require the statement described above concerning tank 
size.

III. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In the NPR, the Commission concluded that the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initial
Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis are not applicable because the Commission has determined that the amendments
``will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
 In the NPR, the Commission initially concluded that not many companies produce pool and spa heaters. The Commission
stated that it had learned that most producers are not ``small entities'' as that term is defined in section 601 of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act and in the regulations of the Small Business Administration, found in 13 CFR 121.
 The Commission also stated that the market for heat pump water heaters is small, and that only a few companies, two of
which are large entities, produce these products at present.
 The Commission noted that most instantaneous water heaters are produced abroad, and are imported by a very small number
of small-sized importing firms.








Because it appeared to the Commission that the amendments were not likely to have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the rules implementing it, the Commission
concluded that a regulatory analysis was not necessary. The Commission, however, requested information in the NPR
about the impact of the amendments on small entities to determine whether a final regulatory analysis was necessary.
 




No comments provided information about the effect of the amendments on small entities. Two comments, however, provided
information on the numbers of entities involved in the manufacture or importation of pool heaters, instantaneous
water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.
 According to these comments, there are six companies that produce pool heaters, twelve that either manufacture (at
least three are foreign) or import instantaneous water heaters, and four that produce heat pump water heaters. Two
of these companies make products in more than one category, so there are 20 companies in all. The Commission has determined
that four of these 20 entities are ``small,'' as defined in the Small Business Administration's Size Standards.
 Of the other 16, the Commission has determined that seven are not ``small.'' The Commission has not been able to determine
the size of the remaining nine.
