</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announces
a forthcoming meeting of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 2119 (7 U.S.C. 6518) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (FACT Act), as amended 
(7 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.), requires establishment of a NOSB. The purpose of the NOSB is to assist in the development
of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on any other
aspects of the implementation of Title XXI of the FACT Act. The NOSB met for the first time in Washington, DC., in March
1992 and currently has five committees to work on various aspects of the program. The committees are: Crops Standards;
Processing, Labelling and Packaging; Livestock Standards; Accreditation; and International Issues. At its last
meeting, the NOSB approved a number of recommendations for submission to the Secretary regarding the implementation
of the national organic program. 



PURPOSE AND AGENDA:

 The main focus of this meeting is to discuss certain substances that should be considered for recommendation for inclusion
on the National List as allowed synthetic substances and certain substances that should be considered for recommendation
on the National List as prohibited natural substances in regard to the organic production and processing of organic
foods. The main emphasis will be on the review of botanical materials that the Act indicates should be reviewed. 



Additional topics to be covered in the full NOSB meeting include mushroom and greenhouse standards, good manufacturing
practices for organic processors and handlers, and livestock healthcare issues. 
A final agenda will be available on September 12, 1994. Persons requesting copies should contact Ms. Faith Ashton
at the above address or phone number. 



TYPE OF MEETING:

 All meetings will be open to the public. Individuals and organizations wishing to provide written comments on these
issues or to comment orally on any organic issues should send the request to Dr. Harold S. Ricker at the above address
or FAX it to (202) 690-0338 by September 30, 1994, in order to be scheduled. The NOSB has scheduled time for public
input on Tuesday, 
October 11, 1994, beginning at 1 p.m. and continuing until 5:30 p.m. While people may sign up to speak at the door, advance
scheduling assures an opportunity in the time allowed and helps the NOSB plan its activities. Each individual or organization
will be allocated 10 minutes for presenting orally the key issues of concern, and should provide copies of written
material elaborating on those issues for the committees.

<DOCTITLE>Announcement of the William C. Foster Fellows Visiting Scholars Program for the 1995-96 School Year</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) will conduct a competition for selection of visiting scholars
to participate in ACDA's activities during the 1995-96 academic year.

Section 28 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2568) provides that ``A program for visiting scholars
in the field of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament shall be established by the Director in order to obtain
the services of scholars from the faculties of recognized institutions of higher learning.'' The law states that
``The purpose of the program will be to give specialists in the physical sciences and other disciplines relevant to
the Agency's activities an opportunity for active participation in the arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament
activities of the Agency and to gain for the Agency the perspective and expertise such persons can offer * * * Fellows
shall be chosen by a board consisting of the Director, who shall be the chairperson, and all former Directors of the
Agency.'' Scholars are known as William C. Foster Fellows, in honor of the first Director of ACDA, William C. Foster,
who served from the inception of ACDA in 1961 until 1969.

ACDA began this program by competitively selecting six visiting scholars for the 1984-85 academic year. The
competition has continued each subsequent academic year until the present. One-year assignments will begin at a
mutually agreeable time after successful completion of all employment requirements.

Positions are available in the Bureau of Strategic and Eurasian Affairs (SEA), the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs
(MA), the Bureau of Intelligence, Verification and Information Support (IVI), and the Bureau of Nonproliferation
Policy and Regional Arms Control (NP). A brochure is available describing these positions in detail. Evaluation
of applicants for appointments to these positions will focus upon the scholar's potential for providing expertise
or performing services needed by ACDA, rather than on the scholar's previously displayed interest in arms control.
While pursuit of the scholar's own line of research may sometimes be possible, support of such activity is not the purpose
of the program.

Visiting scholars will be detailed to ACDA by their universities; the universities will be compensated for the scholar's
salary and benefits in accordance with the Intergovernmental Personnel Act and within Agency limitations. Visiting
scholars will also receive reimbursement for travel to and from the Washington, DC area for their one-year assignment
and either a per diem allowance during the one-year assignment or relocation costs.

Visiting scholars must be citizens of the United States, on the faculty of a recognized institution of higher learning,
and tenured or on a tenure track or equivalent; they also must have served as a permanent career employee of the institution
for at least ninety days before selection for the program. ACDA is an equal opportunity employer. Selections will
be made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or physical handicap that does not interfere
with performance of duties. Prior to appointment applicants will be subject to a full-field background security
investigation for a Top Secret security clearance, as required by Section 45 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
Visiting scholars will also be subject to applicable Federal conflict of interest laws and standards of conduct.

To apply, candidates are asked to submit a letter outlining their interests and qualifications, a curriculum vitae,
copies of two publications, and additional supporting material such as letters of reference. The application deadline
for assignments for the 1995-1996 academic year is January 31, 1995, subject to extension at ACDA's discretion.
ACDA expects to announce tentative selections in the spring of 1995.

To request an information brochure, please write to: Visiting Scholars Program, Office of Operations Analysis and
Information Management, Room 5726, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC
20451 or call on (703) 302-7714.

September 21, 1994

1. Alaska Power Administration 


[Docket No. EF94-1011-000] 



Take notice that on September 16, 1994, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy, by Rate Order No. APA-12,
confirmed and approved on an interim basis effective October 1, 1994, Rate Schedules A-F11, A-N12, and

schedules which are being adjusted were previously confirmed and approved by FERC on January 25, 1991, for a period
of four years, Docket No. EF91-1011-000. 
Current rates in effect are 17 mills per kilowatthour for firm energy; 10 mills per kilowatt-hour for non-firm energy;
and .3 mills per kilowatt-hour for wheeling. APA proposes to increase the rate for firm energy to 18.7 mills per kilowatthour,
an increase of 10 percent. Rates for non-firm energy and wheeling would remain the same. 
The Department requests the approval of the Commission of the adjusted rates for a period not to exceed five years with
the understanding that the rates can be adjusted at an earlier date if needed to comply with the cost recovery criteria.
The rate schedules are submitted for confirmation and approval of a final basis pursuant to authority vested in the

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Power & Light Company; Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


September 21, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380, the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a
subsequent license for the existing Janesville Central Hydroelectric Project, located on the Rock River in Rock
County, Wisconsin, in the city of Janesville, and has prepared a final environmental assessment (EA) for the project.
On April 25, 1994, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that comments on the draft EA
be filed with the Commission within 30 days. Comments were filed by the city of Janesville and are addressed in the final
EA.
In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the
project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.
Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices
at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.

issued in Docket No. CP82-406-000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set
forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Specifically, Southern proposes to construct and operate certain measurement and other appurtenant facilities

service to Atlanta Gas Light Company (Atlanta) so that Atlanta may provide natural gas service for peaking purposes

of the delivery point. Southern further advises that, because the gas will be delivered primarily in the summer, the
installation of the proposed facilities will have no adverse effect on Southern's ability to provide its peak day
or annual deliveries.

Acid Rain Program: Draft Acid Rain Permits; Public Comment Period 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Draft Permits and Public Comment Period. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment draft, five-year Acid Rain permits to 16 utility
plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72).

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA proposes to approve a permit for each affected utility plant that specifies sulfur dioxide emission allowances
and compliance plans as set forth in the notices of final permits cited below. An allowance is a limited authorization
by EPA to emit up to one ton of sulfur dioxide during or after a specified calendar year. As explained in the notice of
withdrawal of final permits (published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

), these final permits were issued as direct final actions and are withdrawn because of the submission of significant,
adverse comments objecting to the issuance of the final permits. 
 

 

The draft permits set forth in this notice are based on and consistent with the Partial Settlement Agreement in 

Environmental Defense Fund

 v. 

Carol M. Browner,

 No. 93-1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993), which the Administrator determined to be a reasonable resolution of certain litigation
issues concerning the Acid Rain regulations, and which was signed on behalf of the Administrator on May 4, 1994. Further,
the draft permit for Petersburg is consistent with other provisions of the Acid Rain regulations (e.g., 40 CFR 72.42)
issued on January 11, 1993, that were challenged in the permit proceeding and in a petition for review. The Administrator
finds, under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, that the draft permits are based on a determination of nationwide
scope and effect. In the absence of such a finding, appeals of the permits or appeals encompassing issues raised in
the instant proceeding would involve petitions for review before more than one Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals.

 

 The following permits (See 59 FR 39339-39341, August 2, 1994 or 59 FR 39767-39768, August 4, 1994) are issued
for public comment: 




Collins in Illinois. 
Crawford in Illinois. 
Fisk in Illinois. 
Joliet 9 in Illinois. 
Joliet 29 in Illinois. 
Powerton in Illinois. 
State Line in Illinois. 
Waukegan in Illinois. 
Will County in Illinois. 
Petersburg in Indiana. 
Allen S. King in Minnesota.

<DOCTITLE>Alfred Waldner Co.; Notice and Order of Revocation of Registrations and Final Determination Governing Sale and Use
of Existing Stocks</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 29, 1990, EPA issued registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate, EPA Reg. No. 66410-1, and Insecticidal
2000 Ready to Use, EPA Reg. No. 66410-2. The original registrant certified that acute toxicity data submitted in support
of these registration applications were obtained using a test substance identical to the Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate
and representative of both insecticides. EPA subsequently determined that the tests were conducted on a substance
which differed in concentration from the registered insecticides and that the tests were willfully misrepresented
to EPA. By this notice, EPA announces and orders the revocation of registrations No. 66410-1 and No. 66410-2. EPA also
announces that no sale or use of existing stocks of these insecticides will be permitted. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 29, 1990, EPA issued registrations to Microft Systems International for the insecticides Insecticidal
2000 Concentrate, EPA Reg. No. 62212-1, and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use, EPA Reg. No. 62212-2. On September 10,
1992, the registrations were transferred to Alfred Waldner Co. under new registration numbers 66410-1 and 66410-2,
respectively.


These registrations were originally issued after a review of acute effects toxicity data submitted with the Insecticidal
2000 Concentrate. Microft Systems certified that the tests were conducted with a test substance identical to Insecticidal
2000 Concentrate. Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use each contain two active ingredients:
Permethrin and Bioresmethrin. The Ready To Use product is a dilution of the concentrate.
The acute toxicity data submitted with the 2000 Concentrate were conducted by RCC-Research and Consulting Co. AG
of Basel, Switzerland. The following five studies were submitted:




EPA's review of these studies indicated that they were adequate to support registration of a concentrate identical
to the proposed concentrate and indicated a classification for acute effects in Toxicity Category 3: a caution label
and associated precautions (40 CFR 156.10(h)).
On October 24, 1991, the Agency issued a registration to Bio-Environmental Products Corp. for the insecticide BEP
Insecticide, EPA Reg. No. 64321-1. This insecticide is a dilution of a concentrate containing the single active ingredient
permethrin. The same five acute studies described above were submitted by Bio-Environmental Products Corp. to support
that application.
It has subsequently been established that the studies referred to above were sponsored by Jesmond, Ltd. BioEnvironmental
Products Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jesmond, Ltd. The test substance in these studies contained the single
active ingredient permethrin. It did not include bioresmethrin and is not identical to the Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate.
EPA has concluded that the registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use are
not supported by the acute toxicity data that were submitted with the registration applications and that the precautionary
labeling cannot be confirmed to be adequate for these insecticides.
This notice is organized into two parts. Part I describes the basis for the revocation of registrations for Waldner's
Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use. Part II describes the procedures which will be
followed in implementing the regulatory actions set forth in this notice, including the treatment of existing stocks.



I. Basis For Revocation


Section 558 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 558) spells out the procedural requirements agencies
must follow when terminating a license. Section 558 states:




Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, the withdrawal,
suspension, revocation, or annulment of a license is lawful only if, before the institution of agency proceedings
therefore, the licensee has been given_(1) notice by the agency in writing of the facts or conduct which may warrant
the action; and (2) opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements. 




Courts have interpreted willfulness to mean ``an intentional misdeed or such gross neglect of a known duty as to be
the equivalent thereof.'' 

Hutto Stockyard, Inc.

 v. 

USDA

 (903 F.2d 299, 304 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting 

Capitol Packing

 v. 

United States

, 350 F.2d 67, 78-79 (10th Cir. 1965); 

Capital Produce Co.

 v. 

United States

, 930 F.2d 1077, 1079 (4th Cir. 1991). To establish willfulness, one need only show that an act or failure to act was intentional,
as opposed to accidental, and proof of an evil motive is unnecessary. 

Emil Lawrence

 v. 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission

, 759 F.2d 767, 769 (9th Cir. 1985).
In this case, the original registrants submitted data which were developed using a product with one active ingredient
when, in fact, their product contained two active ingredients. Registrants certified that the information submitted
was accurate. That certification and submission of data which did not represent the registered product was an intentional
act, not an accidental one; therefore, it falls squarely within the definition of ``willful.'' Because the registrations
were obtained through misrepresentation and a willful violation of the provisions of FIFRA, the registrations were
not valid when granted and the procedural requirements for revocations in APA section 558 do not apply.
Although not required in this case, the Agency did provide registrants written notice as well as an opportunity to
respond to the allegations against them. Registrants did not respond to that notice. These procedures go beyond what
is required by the APA in cases of willful violations of law.


II. Order


This notice announces EPA's decision and order revoking Alfred Waldner's registrations for Insecticidal 2000 Concentrate
and Insecticidal 2000 Ready To Use. It is also notification that the Agency will not permit sale, distribution, or
use of any existing stocks of either insecticide in the United States.

<DOCTITLE>Emergency Exemptions </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has granted specific exemptions for the control of various pests to the 12 States as listed below. Three crisis
exemptions were initiated by various States. These exemptions, issued during the month of June 1994, except for the
one in May 1994, are subject to application and timing restrictions and reporting requirements designed to protect
the environment to the maximum extent possible. EPA has denied seven specific exemption requests from various States.
Information on these restrictions is available from the contact persons in EPA listed below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA has granted specific exemptions to 
the: 


1. Arizona Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on melons to control the sweet potato, or silverleaf
whitefly; June 6, 1994, to July 10, 1994. A request for this use was initially denied on April 15, 1994. The denial was
based on the fact that an exemption issued for this pest problem for another chemical, imidacloprid, was expected
to reduce whitefly populations to a level controllable with the registered alternatives. However, at the time of
issuance of the imidacloprid exemption, some melons were too far along in their development in order to use imidacloprid
once, at or near planting, according to use directions. Therefore, EPA issued this exemption for use of bifenthrin

EPA has denied a specific exemption request from the:

1. Alabama Department of Agriculture and industries for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control beet armyworms.
A notice of receipt published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27017). This specific exemption was denied because the proposed use poses an unreasonable risk
to nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including several endangered species. Although some growers may incur
significant economic losses, the expected statewide losses do not justify the use of this unregistered pesticide
on cotton. (Susan Stanton) 
2. California Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA), Department of Pesticide Regulations, for the use of acephate
on leaf lettuce to control green peach aphids. This specific exemption was denied because CEPA failed to demonstrate
that an emergency condition exists. They claimed that an emergency resulted due to the development of resistance
to registered alternatives; however, no data were submitted to document CEPA's claims. (Larry Fried) 
3. Colorado Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on wheat and barley to control cutworms. This specific
exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate
progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 
4. Georgia Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on southern peas to control cowpea curculio. This specific
exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate
progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 
5. Mississippi Department of Agriculture for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control beet armyworms. A
notice of receipt published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27018). This specific exemption was denied because the proposed use poses a risk of unreasonable
adverse effects on nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including several endangered species. An emergency condition
does not exist in Mississippi. (Susan Stanton) 
6. Montana Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on small grains to control cutworms. This specific
exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate
progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 
7. New Hampshire Department of Agriculture for the use of clomazone on winter squash to control weeds. This specific
exemption was denied because it has been 6 years that the use of clomazone on winter squash has been requested under
section 18 of FIFRA, and it was expected that clomazone would be registered for use in New Hampshire by this growing
season 1994; however, FMC Corporation has not yet submitted an application to add this use to its commercial label.

<DOCTITLE>Ciba-Geigy Corp.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corporation, to conditionally register
the pesticide products Dividend Fungicide and Technical CGA-169374, containing a new active ingredient not included
in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54351), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419-8300,
had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Dividend Fungicide and Technical CGA-169374 (EPA
File Symbols 100-TUN and 100-TGO) containing the active ingredient difenoconazole [(2S,4R) / (2R,4S)]
/ [2R,4R/2S,4S)] 1-(2-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-chlorophenyl]-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl-methyl)-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole at 32 and 92 percent respectively~, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered
products. 
~

These applications ~were approved on August 4, 1994, as Dividend Fungicide (EPA Registration Number 100-740)
as a seed treatment for control of diseases on wheat and Technical CGA-169374 (EPA Registration Number 100-739)
for formulation into end-use fungicide products. 

A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do
not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration
period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public
interest. 

The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of difenoconazole~~ and
information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency
has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent
of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations
which show that use of difenoconazole~~ during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 

Adequate chemistry, toxicological, ecological effects, and environmental fate data have been submitted and reviewed
to support the conditional registration of difenoconazole for use as a seed treatment fungicide of wheat. The terms
of the conditional registration will require Ciba-Geigy to submit Stability of the Technical Grade Active Ingredient
(TGAI) to Metal Ions Study [Guideline Number 63-13], Storage Stability of difenoconazole in other Raw Agricultural
Commodities [171-4(e)], and additional Wheat Field Residue Trials [171-4(k)]. 

Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on difenoconazole.

~~A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager listed above. The data and other
scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10
of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations
Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA
22202 (703-305-5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom
of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington,
DC 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information
desired.

<DOCTITLE>Inert Ingredients in Pesticide Products; List of Minimal Risk Inerts </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is issuing a list of inert ingredients considered to be of minimal risk in pesticide products (List 4A). In addition,
EPA is announcing that substances commonly consumed as food will also be considered minimal risk, List 4A, even if
they have previously not been used in pesticide products and are therefore not currently on the list. Substances commonly
consumed as foods will be considered acceptable for use in all pesticide products, both food and nonfood use, and will
not require a specific exemption from tolerance.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA announced its policy on toxic inert ingredients in pesticide products in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305). Through this policy, EPA encourages the use of the least toxic inert ingredients available
and requires the development of data necessary to determine the conditions of safe use of products that contain toxic
inert ingredients. In developing this policy, EPA categorized inert ingredients into the following four lists according
to toxicity:


List 1_Inerts of toxicological concern.
List 2_Potentially toxic inerts, with high priority for testing.
List 3_Inerts of unknown toxicity.
List 4_Inerts of minimal concern.
In the 

Federal Register

 of November 22, 1989 (58 FR 48314), EPA issued a notice announcing some modifications to the previously published
Lists 1 and 2. In that notice, EPA also noted that List 4 was being divided into two parts. The original List 4 became List
4A, representing minimal risk inert ingredients. List 4B was created to represent inert ingredients for which EPA
has sufficient information to conclude that their current use patterns in pesticide products will not adversely
affect public health and the environment. List 4B will be developed as EPA works through the inerts strategy and reviews
the current inerts on Lists 2 and 3.
EPA is issuing List 4A to provide guidance to formulators of active ingredients being proposed for deregulation under
section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. The substances included on List 4A can be
added to such active ingredients without jeopardizing their deregulated status. These minimum risk inert ingredients
are recognized as safe for use in pesticide products based upon their known properties.
In reviewing List 4 inert ingredients for the proposed section 25(b) rule, many inerts on the original List 4 were moved
from List 4A to List 4B. In particular, acutely toxic inerts were moved to 4B because, although the testing of products
for acute toxicity ensures low concern for these inerts in registered products, without such regulatory oversight
there may be unacceptable acute risks. In addition, many of the inerts on the original List 4 received little review
for environmental fate and ecological effects. Those inerts have been moved to List 4B while EPA further assess their
environmental risks. EPA also plans soon to move inert ingredients now on List 3 to Lists 4A and 4B. The Food and Drug
Administration has considered these inerts for use as direct food additives and in pharmaceuticals, and they are
undergoing additional review by the FDA and the Office of Water before final disposition.
Many of the inerts on List 4A are commonly consumed foods. There may be other foods useful as inert ingredients in pesticide
products that are not included in this list because they have not been used in pesticide products up to now. EPA is announcing
a policy that, as a general matter, it will consider all commonly consumed foods as List 4A, inerts of minimal concern.
Although some commonly consumed foods are currently exempted from the requirement of a tolerance by virtue of their
listing in the 40 CFR 180.1001, EPA generally will no longer list common foods in this way. EPA generally considers
substances that are commonly consumed as food to fall into the category of ``generally recognized as safe'' substances.
EPA will not require a specific listing for commonly consumed foods in this subpart unless specific information suggests
that categorization of ``generally recognized as safe'' is inappropriate.

<DOCTITLE>Supplemental Security Income Program; Notice of Title XVI Continuing Disability Reviews </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Title XVI Continuing Disability Reviews.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commissioner of Social Security announces that continuing disability reviews of persons receiving payments
under title XVI because of disability or blindness will begin October 1, 1994.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 221(i) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that the eligibility of all persons with nonpermanent
impairments receiving benefits because of disability must generally be reviewed at least once every three years.
Section 221(i) also requires that the eligibility of persons having 
permanent impairments be reviewed at such times as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. 


In the preamble to the final regulations on ``Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Determining
Disability and Blindness Frequency and Notice of Continuing Eligibility Reviews,'' published May 7, 1986 (51 FR
16818), we stated on page 16819 that, although section 221(i) of the Act does not mandate periodic eligibility review
of persons receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under title XVI because of disability or blindness,
the final regulations extended the periodic continuing disability review procedures to title XVI blind and disabled
recipients. This extension was within the Secretary's regulatory authority under title XVI of the Act, sections
1631(d)(1) and 1633, and was in accord with the legislative history of the 1980 Amendments to the Act which added section
221(i). Report No. 96-408 of the Senate Committee on Finance at page 61 states:

 

The committee believes that such [periodic review] 
procedures should be applied on the same basis to the DI and SSI programs.

 

We stated in the preamble to the final regulations published on May 7, 1986, that we would review the eligibility of
persons receiving payments solely under title XVI because of disability or blindness with the same frequency as we
review the eligibility of persons receiving disability benefits under title II. We also stated that this would establish
consistency in the operation of the SSI and Social Security disability programs. We announced that when we began the
periodic review of these cases would depend on such considerations as the backlog of pending reviews, the projected
number of new applications, and the availability of resources needed to ensure careful and accurate reviews. We further
stated on page 16820 of the preamble that before we began the periodic reviews of SSI cases, we would notify the public
of the beginning date of the review program by publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

. 
In accordance with this statement, this notice is to inform the public that the periodic continuing disability reviews
of persons receiving SSI payments under title XVI because of disability or blindness will begin October 1, 1994. These
reviews will be conducted under regulations codified at 
20 C.F.R. 416.989 

et seq.

 When we begin a review of a recipient's continuing eligibility to SSI payments, we will notify the recipient of the
review pursuant to these regulations.

Supporting Statement for Information Collection_GNMA Multiclass Securities Program



A. Justification



1. This information collection is required in connection with the implementation of the full participation stage
of GNMA's Multiclass Program. GNMA's authority to guarantee Multiclass instruments in contained in section 306(g)(1)
of the National Housing Act (``NHA'') (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(1)), which authorizes GNMA to guarantee ``securities * * *
based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages * * *.'' The Multiclass securities will be
based on or backed by mortgages since GNMA Mortgage-Backed Securities (``MBS'') will serve as the collateral. This
position is consistent with the FNMA and FHLMC REMIC programs which are authorized by substantially similar statutory
provisions. Further, GNMA's authority to operate a Multiclass program has recently been recognized in section 3004
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (``OBRA'') which amended section 306(g)(3) of the NHA (12 U.S.C.
1721(g)(3)) to provide GNMA with greater flexibility for the Multiclass program regarding fee structure, contracting,
industry consultation and program implementation. Congress annually sets GNMA's commitment authority to guarantee
MBS pursuant to section 306(g)(2) of the NHA (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(2)). Since the Multiclass securities will be backed
by GNMA MBS, GNMA has already guaranteed the collateral for the Multiclass instruments.

The Multiclass Program had an initial stage and GNMA is now implementing a full participation stage. During the initial
stage, GNMA guaranteed Multiclass instruments that were issued by a small number of participants, consisting of
sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel and accounting firms, selected by GNMA through the use of Competitive
Application Proposals (``CAPS''). At the conclusion of the initial stage, participation in the GNMA-guaranteed
Multiclass Program will be expanded. GNMA is requiring information from entities that wish to participate as sponsor,
co-sponsor, accountant, trust counsel and minority and women-owned law firms in the full participation stage.

Each participant is required to certify annually that neither the participant nor any employee, partner or officer
working on the GNMA Multiclass Securities Program has been convicted of or has been found liable in a civil action for
fraud, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements or any other indicating
a lack of business integrity that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of the officer, partner
or professional, and is not currently suspended or debarred by a state or the Federal government. Each sponsor is required
to certify that the sponsor has developed and implemented a plan for minority and women-owned law firm participation
and the extent to which the plan was achieved.

To secure trustee services, GNMA is requesting applications from qualified institutions under a CAP. Trustees approved
pursuant to the CAP will be authorized to serve with respect to securities issued during the period specified in the
CAP.

2. The information provided by the participants will be submitted to GNMA. GNMA requires the information requested
in order to assure the financial integrity of the program.

3. It is impractical and would be inefficient to design improved technology to collect this information.

4. There will be no duplication of information.

5. There is no similar information already available which could be used or modified for this purpose.

6. We have attempted to minimize the burden on the participants by requiring the minimum amount of information needed
to ensure the integrity of the Multiclass Program.

7. The information will be collected on an annual basis to demonstrate that the participant continues to meet the eligibility
requirements.

8. There are no specific circumstances that require the information collection to be conducted in a manner which is
inconsistent with guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.

9. There has been no outside consultation on this information collection. The Notice will call for public comments
after it is published.

10. No assurances of confidentiality are provided.

11. There is no sensitive information requirements in the application process.

12. GNMA does not estimate that there will be any additional cost to the Federal Government. The information will be
reviewed in accordance with GNMA's existing review and monitoring procedures. Annual cost to the participants is
established to be minimal.

Excerpts From GNMA Supplemental Notice for Multiclass Securities Program That Contain the Paperwork Provisions:



B. Sponsors



* * * * *



GNMA requires entities wishing to participate in this program as Sponsors to provide GNMA with certain information
and meet certain requirements. Currently, a Sponsor must have minimum capital assets of $250 million in shareholders'
equity, evidenced by the Sponsor's most recent audited financial statements. GNMA also requires that Sponsors have
had at least one REMIC transaction with the Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') or the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC''). If an entity that wishes to sponsor GNMA guaranteed transactions has not
had this experience, GNMA requires an alternative demonstration of experience, as GNMA determines appropriate.
A computer bulletin board, gREX, will be used to announce revisions to this policy.

Entities that would like to obtain application forms or obtain further information should contact Chemical New York,
Inc., 1325 G St., N.W., Suite 640, Washington, D.C. 20005.



C. Selection of Trustee



* * * * *



To secure trustee services, GNMA has requested applications from qualified institutional trustees under a CAP.
In the meantime, the trustees approved for the initial stage will continue to serve as trustees for multiclass securities
transactions. Trustee services must include tax administration as well as customary securities administrative
and payment functions. Trustees approved pursuant to the CAP will be authorized to serve with respect to securities
issued during the period (not more than five years) specified in the request for applications. Once a trustee is assigned
to a specific transaction, it will continue to act as trustee for the life of the security, unless removed in accordance
with the Trust Agreement. Sponsors will use trustees approved pursuant to the CAP. Trustees will be paid from funds
related to the transaction.



D. Trust Counsel and Accounting Firms



Trust counsel selected by the Sponsor will provide customary securities and tax opinions on the transactions, in
accordance with GNMA's requirements.

Accounting firms selected by the Sponsor will perform customary procedures with respect to financial information
included in the offering documents and as part of the closing process, in accordance with GNMA's requirements. GNMA
currently requires entities wishing to participate in GNMA guaranteed transactions to submit certain information
to GNMA. Interested parties may obtain the appropriate forms from Chemical New York, Inc. (``Chemical Bank'') at
the address set out in section II.B. above.

Example of Procedure Involving Information Collection


Request for Competitive Application Proposals To Act as Trustee to the Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA) During the Full Participation Stage of the New GNMA Multiclass Securities Program


To Interested Parties:
Enclosed is Request for Competitive Application Proposals (CAP) GNMA-94-R-01. The purpose of
this CAP is to solicit from qualified parties (applicants) detailed and comprehensive applications to serve as trustee
for transactions during the full participation stage of the GNMA Multiclass Securities program.
For over two decades, GNMA has operated a single class mortgage-backed securities (MBS) program, under which GNMA
guarantees, with the full faith and credit of the United States, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities
issued by private firms approved as GNMA issuers. GNMA has recently initiated a Multiclass Securities program, which
began with an initial stage that includes a limited number of participants who assisted in developing the program
and in closing transactions to date. GNMA is now moving toward implementation of the full participation stage of the
Multiclass Securities program. Henry Cisneros, Security of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has
approved a GNMA Multiclass Securities program, which will be operated to meet the requirements of the Real Estate
Mortgage Investment Conduit (GNMA REMIC securities) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition,
GNMA is considering implementing a Grantor Trust (STRIPs) and possibly other multiclass programs. GNMA's existing
single class MBS program also will continue in operation.



  Sincerely yours,

I. Background


The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) was created in 1968 through amendment of Title III of the National
Housing Act (12 U.S.C. Sections 1716 

et seq

). GNMA is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development and supports
Federal housing initiatives by providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and attracting funds from national
and international capital markets into the U.S. residential mortgage market. The operations of GNMA are overseen
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and by the President of GNMA, both of whom are appointed by the President
of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.
Through its MBS program, GNMA guarantees the timely payment principal and interest on securities issued by private
institutions and backed by pools of Federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee is backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States. Each year, GNMA guaranteed securities provide the financing for
approximately 95% of all loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) (Government mortgages).
As of July 1994, more than one trillion dollars in securities have been issued assisting an estimated 15 million families
to obtain financing. In excess of $440 billion of GNMA guaranteed securities are outstanding, of which more than $429
billion are based on single family (1-4 unit) residential mortgage loans. The GNMA guarantee lowers the cost
of home ownership by attracting the substantial amounts of investor funds necessary to allow low- and moderate-income
borrowers to acquire housing with Government mortgages.


GNMA's Current Single Class Program


Prior to the development of single class MBS, investments in residential mortgages were largely illiquid. Beginning
in 1970, GNMA pioneered the creation and orderly maintenance of a secondary mortgage market by guaranteeing, with
the full faith and credit of the United States, privately issued certificates backed by pools of mortgages provided
for the purchase of single family, multifamily, and manufactured housing.
Holders of GNMA MBS receive monthly payments of principal and interest made on the underlying mortgage loans. The
amount of interest ``passed through'' to security holders is reduced by payment of a fee to cover servicing of the mortgages
(in the case of single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 44 basis points on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage)
and a fee to GNMA for its guarantee (for single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 6 basis points).
Under the ``modified pass-through'' approach used by GNMA, the issuer of the MBS is initially responsible for advancing
scheduled but delinquent principal and interest payments to security holders. That is, if mortgagors fail to make
timely payments of principal and interest, the issuer of the GNMA MBS promises to advance the necessary funds so that
scheduled payments can be made to the security holders. If the issuer fails to advance or pass through payments, GNMA
pays pursuant to its guarantee.
The MBS guaranteed by GNMA have a single class of ownership interests. Each security bears the same coupon rate of interest,
has the same scheduled maturity, and has the same expected weighted average life.
Evidence of ownership of GNMA securities takes two forms: physical securities or book entry securities. Beginning
in July of 1990, all GNMA MBS, except for serial notes and construction loan securities, were issued in book entry depository
form. More than 90 percent of GNMA securities are currently held in book entry form. The Participants Trust Company
(PTC) is the depository that holds GNMA securities in book entry form. The PTC collects and disburses principal and
interest (P&I) payments to its participants for all deposited MBS.


II. Operating a GNMA Multiclass Securities Program


The GNMA Multiclass Securities program will be operated in a manner consistent with the traditional GNMA approach
of relying upon the private sector to the greatest extent possible, maintaining GNMA in the position of a guarantor
rather than an issuer.


The GNMA REMIC program


The MBS making up the corpus of the trust will be assembled by a knowledgeable and financially sound firm (the Sponsor)
that also takes the initiative in forming the trust, in developing the structure for the REMIC Securities (i.e., how
many tranches with what characteristics), in preparing the description and disclosure for the offering documents
and in marketing the securities. The principal responsibility for initiating and carrying out GNMA REMIC Securities
transactions will rest not with GNMA but with the sponsor and with the Trustee of the issuing trust, assisted by trust
counsel.

<PARENT> FR940928-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A separate trust will be used for each series of securities. A Trustee of proven reliability and competence must ensure
that amounts owed to the trust are collected by it, that the correct amounts are distributed in a timely manner to the
right persons, and that accurate records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, the
Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), GNMA and its agents. Rules and procedures governing the trust and its operation,
including detailed rules about the timing and amounts to be distributed to security holders will be spelled out in
trust documents drafted by experienced trust counsel based on documents prepared by GNMA and its legal advisor (the
``LA''), and incorporated in the GNMA Multiclass Securities program Guide.
The sponsor will guarantee to GNMA that payments on the MBS held by a trust will be sufficient to support all amounts
due on the securities under all circumstances (assuming no default on the MBS themselves). The sponsor's guarantee
of ``structural integrity'' will be confirmed by an approved accounting firm and GNMA's financial advisor (the ``FA'').


The GNMA Strips Program


GNMA anticipates a Grantor Trust (Strip) securities program. For each Strip securities transaction, a grantor trust
would be formed to issue the Strip securities. The sponsor would provide the MBS collateral which was combined into
a larger GNMA Platinum security (a mega MBS), which in turn is the collateral for the Strip securities. Interest Only
(IO), Principal Only (PO) classes (completely stripped) and partially stripped classes (synthetics) would be issued
by the grantor trust. The Strip securities would be sold directly to investors or may be used as collateral for REMICs.
An investor would combine an IO and PO and swap the recombined IO/OP for an interest in the Platinum security that has
the same aggregate principal balance and same interest payment. Various other recombinations may also be allowed
as the program progresses.
The GNMA Strip program in general will work the same way as a GNMA REMIC trust. The transfer agent, Chemical Bank and
PTC will perform the same functions except that provisions will have to be made for the recombinations and exchanges.
An accounting firm must provide a comfort letter and trust counsel must opine on the validity of the securities and
that the transaction will not be subject to double taxation because it qualifies as a grantor trust under the Tax Code.


Other GNMA Multiclass Securities Programs


From time to time, GNMA may introduce additional multiclass products for which the Trustee would provide similar
services.


Fees and Expenses


GNMA will have no liability for payment of any fees or expenses, such as those of the FA, trust counsel and accounting
firms. These will be payable by the sponsor. Trustee's fees will be payable as provided in Section IV, below.


III. Scope of Services To Be Provided By Trustee


Trustee functions are critical to the successful operation of the GNMA Multiclass Securities program. Therefore,
the selected trust firms will provide general Trustee services in accordance with the GNMA Multiclass Securities
guide and other operative documents. This guide may be obtained by calling (800) 2341-REX. These guidelines
and documents are subject to amendment and modification. The equivalent documents for the Grantor Trust (Strips)
program are not available at this time. The general Trustee functions include, but are not limited to:
A. For each Multiclass Securities transaction to which a Trustee is retained by a Sponsor, that Trustee shall provide
all services and documents customarily provided by Trustees in similar transactions and necessary or helpful to
establish the trust and issue the Multiclass Securities, including:
1. Execute the documents under which the trust shall receive GNMA MBS from the sponsor in exchange for Multiclass Securities
and under which the trust shall operate for its term, and fulfill all appropriate responsibilities thereunder. Enclosed
as exhibits are the Operational Guidelines (Exhibit I), the current form of Trust Agreement (Exhibit II), the Trust
Provisions (Exhibit III), and the Tax Administration Guidelines (Exhibit IV). These exhibits are for information
purposes and are subject to change.
2. Verify ownership of the MBS backing the multiclass securities and ensure that all of the MBS meet the requirements
of the relevant Multiclass Securities program.

3. Administer physical securities as necessary.
B. For each multiclass securities transaction the Trustee shall provide all necessary ongoing Trustee services
to the trust for the life of the trust, including:
1. Calculate distributions of principal and interest to multiclass security holders; ensure that amounts owed to
the trust are collected by it, that the correct amounts are paid out timely by the trust to the proper security holders,
and that accurate records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, and IRS, GNMA and
its agents.
2. Properly maintain, report on and, if necessary, access the variance account, which is a separate holding account
used to maintain overages/shortages of funds in the Multiclass Securities program. Variance issues arise when cash
received from MBS issuers differs from cash payable to Multiclass Security holders, usually because of missing or
incorrect information on the factor tape used to calculate multiclass payment factors (the R-7 tape). To the
extent that cash actually received from the issuers is greater than the multiclass distribution amount, that amount
will be held in the variance account for payment in the following month and a ``prepayment interest shortfall'' (the
Multiclass Security rate less the reinvestment rate) difference will likely be created. The variance account must
be established by the Trustee. Losses caused by the prepayment interest shortfall will be paid by GNMA as part of its
guarantee obligation.
To illustrate the variance process, assume the Trustee receives MBS payments of $100 more than is required to be distributed
on the Multiclass Securities for that month. This $100 must be deposited in the variance account by the Trustee until
the next month before it is distributed to the investor. Meanwhile, the $100 is earning interest at the reinvestment
rate while the Trust owes the investors the multiclass coupon rate, creating negative arbitrage. The Trustee must
calculate the prepayment interest shortfall and notify GNMA, which will make the funds available to the Trustee,
and/or PTC, prior to payment to the investors.
Subsequent to the monthly distributions to the investors, PTC will reconcile the MBS payments received from issuers
with distributions made to the trust. This may result in PTC distributing additional cash to the trust or the trust
being required to refund overpayments to PTC. Should insufficient funds be available to pay such ``refunds'' from
the trust's accounts, then the Trustee will be required to advance such refund until the next distribution date when
the Trustee will be reimbursed from funds available in the accounts or from GNMA.
The Trustee will establish all accounts needed for each Trust. These currently include the Depository Account at
PTC, the Certificated Securities Account for payment of non-book entry distributions, if applicable, and the Variance
Account. The variance process will consider all three accounts and therefore, all three accounts will be included
in the monthly reconciliation and reporting process. Reporting for the variance process will involve determining
any shortfalls prior to the distribution date and notifying GNMA and its agent thereof, as well as subsequent detail
reconciliations of payment differences in accordance with procedures and forms prescribed by GNMA.
Differences between MBS payments received and amounts distributable to multiclass security holders (MBS factor
errors) may also arise because of errors in the computation of tranche factors by the Trustee. In that case, the Trustee
is responsible for funding the difference.
3. Indemnify and hold harmless GNMA (including each official, officer and agent of GNMA) from and against any and all
losses, claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses (including, without limitation, all attorneys' fees and related
charges and expenses) resulting, directly or indirectly, from any Trustee default or other failure to perform under
their agreements with or for the benefit of GNMA. Without limiting the foregoing, GNMA's right to indemnification
shall include the right to reimbursement of any and all amounts paid by GNMA to any holder of any certificate, security,
or pass-through interest as a result of any failure of the Trustee to properly calculate the amount of any required
distribution to any such holder or to cause the proper distributions to be made to any such holder, together with interest
thereon at a rate equal to the yield on three month treasury securities.
4. All initial and ongoing tax administration with respect to the trusts and, in the case of REMIC transactions, the
REMICs. The Trustee may subcontract its tax administration duties, but, if it does so, (i) it must retain the subcontractor
for the duration of the Trustee's engagement (unless the subcontractor fails to perform its duties in a satisfactory
manner), (ii) the Trustee will retain liability for the proper performance of all tax administration duties and (iii)
GNMA must approve the successor tax administrator.
Various of the documents in the GNMA multiclass securities program Guide set forth duties of a ``Tax Administrator''
with respect to each Series of securities. The Trustee will be responsible for all of the duties assigned to the Tax
Administrator in the GNMA Multiclass Program Guide, as that Guide may be in effect from time to time. Those duties include,
but are not limited to the following:
a. 

Startup. 

Computing the yields, amounts of original issue discount (``OID'') and other information required to be set forth
in the OID legends on the securities. The Tax Administrator shall confirm that information with the results of the
sponsor, which independently is responsible for producing the same information. The Tax Administrator shall be
responsible for supplying such information to trust counsel, which will be responsible for the preparation of the
text of the legends.
b. 

Ongoing Accounting. 

Preparing the federal, state, and local tax returns of the trust and any related REMICs (including the computation
of all necessary underlying information), computing the information concerning OID, market discount, premium,
interest, and other reportable items on the securities, and forwarding that information to (or otherwise making
that information available to) security holders and the IRS. Income tax accounting and reporting shall be done in
accordance with the law, tax administration guidelines for accounting set forth in the GNMA Multiclass program Guide
or other instructions distributed by GNMA (as those may be in effect from time to time), and accepted industry practice,
in that order of priority. The Tax Administrator shall consult with GNMA on any significant tax accounting issues
that arise.
c. 

Controversy. 

The Tax Administrator shall represent the trust and any related REMIC in any inquiry or assessment of liability by
the IRS or state or local tax authorities. The Tax Administrator shall keep GNMA and the LA informed of the initiation
of any inquiry or assessment of liability and of any significant related development.
5. Rebate_Transfer in a timely manner to GNMA any amounts from PTC as a result of investment earnings on funds received
by PTC on the MBS from the date these funds are received to the date the funds are distributed on the Multiclass Securities.
These amounts are commonly called the PTC rebate and are distributed quarterly by PTC at this time.

6. If another approved Trustee is no longer permitted by GNMA to act as a Trustee or fails to perform in the Multiclass
Securities Program, all other Trustees must be willing to assume the ongoing administration of any Trust formerly
held by a Trustee which is no longer approved to participate in the program. 

7. 

Cross Default Provision

_GNMA shall have the right to terminate a Trustee's approved status for cause. If a Trustee fails to properly administer
a trust, which results in a finding of cause by GNMA, all trusts administered by the Trustee may be transferred to another
GNMA approved Trustee.

C. For the strip securities, the Trustee will perform all of the services outlined in paragraphs A and B above, as necessary.
The Trustee must also provide all services necessary for recombining the IO/PO securities into Platinum securities
and must accurately track all securities through the recombination process.



IV. Trustee Fee




During the initial stage of the Multiclass Securities program, the Trustee fee was paid as a ``strip'' out of monthly
interest collections, based on the aggregate remaining principal balance of the Multiclass Securities outstanding
at the beginning of the month. However, this method created a general awkwardness of having security classes bearing
interest at, for instance, 7.99%, which is not favorably received in the market place.


In the full participation stage, the Trustee's fee will be paid initially through the creation of an interest bearing
REMIC Class which would only be transferrable to a successor Trustee.

This so-called ``T Class'' would be structured to receive a pro rata share of principal of the underlying MBS and interest
at the certificate rate of the underlying MBS. The Class would be designated as a class of securities in the offering
circular and the underlying documents; however it would not be tradeable and would not carry any voting rights or other
substantive rights associated with the other regular interests in the REMIC trusts. The principal amount of the T
Class would be negotiated between sponsors and Trustees with no involvement by GNMA.

To pay a Trustee in the GNMA Strip program it is expected that IO and PO classes will be delivered and immobilized at the
Trustee to replicate the REMIC fee structure.

These fee arrangements may be changed at any time only at the option of GNMA. Such a change would only occur with extensive
consultation with GNMA Trustees and Sponsors.



V. Period of Performance



The selections to be made under this CAP will be for an initial period of two years and will provide for three one-year
extension periods at GNMA's option. Trustees will have an ongoing obligation to administer for the life of all trusts
received during that time period.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the Mobile River Basin aquatic ecosystem, an area in Alabama with portions extending into east Mississippi and
northwest Georgia. This plan specifically addresses the recovery objectives, criteria, and tasks for 1 fish (goldline
darter, 

Percina aurolineata

), 11 mussels (Alabama moccasinshell, 

Medionidus acuitissiumus; 

orange-nacre mucket, 

Lampsilis perovalis; 

fine-line pocketbook, 

Lampsilis altilis; 

southern acornshell, 

Epioblasma othcaloogensis; 

uplan combshell, 

Epioblasma metastriata; 

Coosa moccasinshell, 

Medionidus parvulus; 

ovate clubshell, 

Pleurobema perovatum; 

southern clubshell, 

Pleurobema decisum

; dark pigtoe, 

Pleurobema furvum;

 southern pigtoe, 

Pleurobema georgianum; 

triangular kidneyshell, 

Ptychobrachus greenii

), and 1 aquatic snail 

(Tulotoma magnifica).

 Additionally, it complements recovery plans previously developed for another 17 listed aquatic species within
the Mobile River Basin. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program.
To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native
to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish
criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the
recovery measures needed.




The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.



The species considered in this draft recovery plan are the goldline darter 

(Percina aurolineata), 

Alabama moccasinshell 

(Medionidus acutissimus),

 orange-nacre mucket 

(Lampsilis perovalis),

 fine-lined pocketbook 

(Lampsilis altilis),

 southern acornshell 

(Epioblasma othcaloogensis),

 upland combshell 

(Epioblasma metastriata),

 Coosa moccasinshell 

(Medionidus parvulus),

 ovate clubshell 

(Pleurobema perovatum),

 southern clubshell 

(Pleurobema decisum),

 dark pigtoe 

(Pleurobema furvum),

 southern pigtoe 

(Pleurobema georgianum),

 triangular kidneyshell 

(Ptychobranchus greeni),

 and the tulotoma snail 

(Tulotoma magnifica).

 The goldline darter was listed as threatened in 1992 due to a suspected decline in historic range, population fragmentation
and isolation, and existing threats to extant populations due to water quality degradation. In 1993, eight of the
11 mussels were listed as endangered, and three as threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from
impoundment and their vulnerability to existing sources of habitat and water quality degradation. The tulotoma
snail was listed as endangered in 1991 due to the loss of more than 90 percent of its historic habitat, and the isolation
and vulnerability of surviving populations.




The recovery objective of the draft plan is to protect the Basin's native aquatic fauna and flora by achieving ecosystem
stabilization. Specific recovery objectives include reclassification and eventual delisting of the tulotoma
snail; delisting of the goldline darter; and preventing the extinction of the eight endangered mussels and the continued
decline of the three threatened mussels. Actions needed for ecosystem stabilization will require protection of
habitat integrity and water quality by full and appropriate implementation of Federal and State regulatory authorities;
development and implementation of Best Management Practices and Water Quality Plans for construction, agriculture,
urban, and suburban activities that affect aquatic ecosystems; development and implementation of Drainage Management
Plans that address problems specific to drainages occupied by listed species; development, funding, and implementation
of programs that educate and directly involve the general public in ecosystem recovery; and basic research on life
history, ecology, anatomy, taxonomy, contaminant sensitivities, and propagation technology of listed and candidate
species.



This Plan is being submitted for technical/agency review. After consideration of comments received during the review
period, it will be submitted for final approval.






Public Comments Solicited





The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.







Authority







The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public workshop.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to inform the public of a workshop to exchange information and review lessons learned in the characterization
of radioactively contaminated decommissioning sites. The workshop will discuss the NRC draft guidance on site characterization
for decommissioning and address generic issues related to NRC's decommissioning sites, such as characterization
of sites and associated environmental media, types and extent of contamination, and environmental impacts.

 To support evaluation of alternative decommissioning actions and detailed planning of a preferred approach
for decommissioning, decontamination, and waste management.
The NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) has coordinated two public workshops to exchange
information and discuss issues identified in the Action Plan. The first workshop was convened on November 19, 1992,
and dealt with the overall SDMP and the SDMP Action Plan implementation. The second SDMP workshop was held on June 1,
1994, on the issue of final radiological surveys at SDMP sites. A large number of attendees of the June 1 workshop requested
NRC to conduct a similar workshop on site characterization. NRC is now planning to conduct a workshop to exchange information
and discuss issues associated with site characterization for decommissioning.



CONDUCT OF THE WORKSHOP:

 The workshop will be held for two days on November 29-30, 1994. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss site characterization
of the SDMP sites, to promote direct interaction among NRC staff, licensees and contractors, federal agencies, states,
other interested parties, and members of the public, and to exchange information on site characterization for decommissioning.


The first day of the workshop will comprise plenary sessions that include presentations by speakers from NRC management
responsible for establishing decommissioning policy and those responsible for implementation of the SDMP. NRC
speakers will also include technical staff responsible for developing the NRC draft guidance on ``Site Characterization
for Decommissioning'' and those frequently conducting the technical reviews of SDMP site characterization. The
workshop will also include key speakers from other federal agencies (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Department of the Army), NRC licensees, and the Agreement States. The first
day's session will address the following topics:



1. NRC's policy on site characterization for decommissioning,
2. The coordinated Federal Manual on Radiological Surveys,
3. EPA, DOE, the U.S. Army and Agreement States views on site characterization,
4. NRC licensees views and experience with site characterization, and
5. NRC guidance and staff experience with SDMP site characterization.



Copies of the NRC's draft guidance ``Branch Technical Position On Site Characterization For Decommissioning''
will be available at the workshop or may be requested in advance by contacting Boby Eid at (301) 415-5811.
The second day of the workshop will consist of breakout discussion groups. Each attendee should select, in advance,
two discussion groups to attend (one from category A and another from category B of the groups listed below). There
will be four concurrent discussion groups in two series (A & B) to discuss the following issues:



Group A1 The role of historical site data collection, review, and analysis in optimizing site characterization
efforts,
Group A2 Background characterization, sampling, and sample averaging of contaminated media,
Group A3 Groundwater/surface water and associated media characterization,
Group A4 The use of models and codes in site characterization and demonstration of compliance with regulatory
guidelines,
Group B1 Prioritization of site characterization activities,
Group B2 Approaches to selection of radiological techniques and methods in site characterization,
Group B3 Significance of direct interaction between licensees, contractors, and the regulators, and 
Group B4 The Coordinated Federal Manual on Environmental Radiological Surveys.



After the breakout discussion sessions, all attendees will meet in a final general session where discussion group
leaders will summarize any conclusions or observations reached by the discussion groups. All attendees are encouraged
to participate in the discussions after each presentation and in the breakout discussion sessions.



REGISTRATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION:

 Persons interested in attending the workshop should register in advance. For registration and further information,
contact Boby Eid at (301) 415-5811 or Mary Hood at (301) 415-6644, from the Low-level Waste and Decommissioning
Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards
Considerations</DOCTITLE>




I. Background



Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 2, 1994, through
September 16, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47163).



Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By October 28, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why internvetion should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The Nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake
and Chatham Counties, North Carolina 





Date of amendment request: 

August 25, 1994. 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Table 2.2-1, Reactor Trip System Instrumentation
Trip Setpoints, and Table 3.3-4, Engineered Safety Actuation System Instrumentation Trip Setpoints, to reflect
a revised steam generator [water] level process measurement accuracy. The steam generator level trip setpoints
are not affected by the proposed amendment. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

 


1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 

The Technical Specification Tables 2.2-1 and 3.3-4 which document Total Allowable, Z, and S values are
being revised to reflect additional Process Measurement Error uncertainties based upon enhanced knowledge of steam
generator performance provided by the Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) vendor. There will be no physical changes
to plant equipment, logic, or control as a result of the proposed amendment. The safety-related trip setpoints are
not being changed. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The propose amendment does not introduce any new equipment, logic, or control functions. The steam generator water
level protective setpoints are not being changed. No new common mode failure mechanism is being introduced. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification Tables 2.2-1 and 3.3-4 to more accurately reflect
PMA uncertainties based upon enhanced knowledge of the steam generator performance provided by the NSSS vendor.
The margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specifications is not reduced by the proposed changes to the Tables.
Calculations demonstrate that this requirement is still satisfied with the new values based upon the enhanced understanding
of PMA terms. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Duke Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-369 and 50-370, McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, Mecklenburg
County, North Carolina 




Date of amendment request:

 August 25, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendments allow the testing interval for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system pumps to be increased from
monthly to quarterly on a staggered test basis. The proposed amendments are consistent with NRC staff recommendations
and guidance contained in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements''
and Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation.'' 
In addition, the requested amendments incorporate a note from Surveillance Requirement 3.7.5.2 of NUREG-1431,
``Revised Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants'' into the existing McGuire Technical Specifications
governing AFW system pump testing. This note clarifies that the turbine-driven AFW pump cannot be tested until the
required pressure exists in the secondary side of the steam generator. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91, this analysis is provided concerning whether the requested amendments involve significant
hazards considerations, as defined by 10 CFR 50.92. Standards for determination that an amendment request involves
no significant hazards considerations are if operation of the facility in accordance with the requested amendment
would not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;
or 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 3) Involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The requested amendments decrease from monthly to quarterly the frequency at which the motor-driven and turbine-driven
AFW pumps must be demonstrated operable as specified in TS... 4.7.1.2 (McGuire). They also incorporate a note of clarification
from the new Westinghouse STS [Standard Technical Specifications] into the existing... McGuire specification
concerning when the pump head or discharge pressure versus flow verification for the turbine-driven pump is required
to be performed. 
In 48 FR 14870, the Commission has set forth examples of amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant
hazards considerations. Example vii describes a change to make a license conform to changes in regulations, where
the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.
The requested amendments are similar to example vii in that they result in minor changes to plant surveillance requirements
and are consistent with the existing NRC position and guidance contained in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05,
as well as NUREG-1431. While the issuance of NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 93-05, as well as NUREG-1341
does not constitute a change in existing regulations, it nevertheless establishes the NRC staff's position concerning
the acceptability of decreasing the surveillance frequency of AFW pumps from monthly to quarterly and concerning
the acceptability of adopting all or part of the new STS. The requested amendments are consistent with the position
of NUREG-1366 and with the guidance of Generic Letter 93-05, as well as with NUREG-1431. 


Criterion 1 


The requested amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will
have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. 
Also, since... McGuire's AFW pump performance histories support making the proposed change, system response following
an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident
consequences. ***Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required
to be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. The pump will
still be tested as before and its acceptance criteria will be unaffected. 


Criterion 2 


The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created
from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in different manner. ***Incorporating the clarifying
note from the new STS will not result in any new accident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected. 


Criterion 3 


The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will
be unaffected by the proposed changes. The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function,
since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased
as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently.
Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366
and Generic Letter 93-05. ***Incorporating the note from the new STS will not impact any safety margins.

Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that the requested amendments do not involve a significant
hazards consideration.

The proposed technical specification amendment has been reviewed against the criteria of 10 CFR 51.22 for environmental
considerations. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration, nor increase the
types and amounts of effluents that may be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational
radiation exposures. Therefore, the proposed amendment meets the criteria given in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9) for a categorical
exclusion from the requirement for an Environmental Impact Statement.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Illinois Power Company and Soyland Power Cooperative, Inc., Docket No. 50-461, Clinton Power Station, Unit
No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois 





Date of amendment request: 

June 13, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Clinton Power Station Technical Specification 3/4.6.1.8, ``Containment Building
Ventilation and Purge Systems,'' which includes a requirement to perform a leak rate measurement at least once per
92 days on each 36-inch supply and exhaust containment ventilation isolation valve with a resilient seal. The proposed
modification would require a leak test at least once per 18 months provided the valves remain closed during that period.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:




(1) The proposed change does not involve a change in plant design. Failure of or leakage through a containment barrier
cannot itself create an accident; therefore, this change would not increase the probability of any accident previously
evaluated. Failure of or leakage through a containment barrier can, however, increase the consequences of those
accidents previously evaluated. The proposed change merely revises the frequency at which the local leak rate test
is performed on the containment building HVAC 36-inch supply and exhaust penetrations. The containment isolation
valves for these penetrations are normally only opened during refueling outages. The stroke testing for the isolation
valves has been changed to a cold shutdown frequency and, as a result, there is no mechanism present to degrade the seals
and cause increased leakage through the penetration. Based on past penetration leak rate measurements, it has been
determined that leak rate testing on an 18-month frequency is sufficient to identify seal degradation if the valves
are not opened. However, should the valves be opened during the 18-month interval, the proposed change would require
that a leak rate test be performed within 92 days. This will ensure that the leak rate for the given penetration has not
exceeded the specified limit as a result of stroking the valve. Penetration leakage will continue to be measured at
sufficient intervals to identify seal degradation in the 36-inch containment isolation valves. In addition, the
same leakage limits will be imposed. Therefore, the proposed change will not result in a significant increase in the
probability or the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 

(2) This request does not result in any change to the plant design nor does it involve a change in current plant operation.
The proposed change will not change the design basis for the valves being leak tested. The valves will continue to be
verified to meet the required leak rate and the safety function of the subject valves remains unchanged. Furthermore,
any potential leakage through the containment building HVAC 36-inch supply exhaust and supply penetrations cannot
create an accident. As a result, the proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) The only margin of safety that could potentially be impacted by the proposed change to the surveillance requirement
frequency is the margin concerning the offsite dose consequences of postulated accidents (which is directly related
to the containment leak rate). As discussed above, this request does not result in a significant increase in the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated. It has been demonstrated that the penetration leakage does not change appreciably
when the valves are not stroked. Therefore, since the valves are normally only opened during refueling outages, leakage
through the penetrations is not expected to change during the proposed 18-month interval between leak rate tests.
Should the valves be opened during the 18-month interval, a local leak rate test will be performed within 92 days. The
proposed leak rate test frequency will provide sufficient indication of seal degradation to allow the opportunity
for repair before gross leakage failures develop. In addition, the proposed change involves no change to the currently
established leak rate test acceptance criteria. As a result, the proposed changes do not result in a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois 





Date of amendment request: 

August 12, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Clinton Power Station Technical Specification 3/4.6.2.2, ``Drywell Bypass
Leakage,'' to allow drywell by pass leakage rate tests (DBLRTs) to be performed at intervals as long as ten years based
on the demonstrated performance of the drywell structure. DBLRTs are currently required to be performed once every
18 months.



Basis of proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:




(1) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design or operation. As a result, the proposed change
does not affect any of the parameters or conditions that contribute to initiation of any accidents previously evaluated.
Thus, the proposed change cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change potentially affects the leak tight integrity of the drywell, a structure used to mitigate the
consequences of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The function of the drywell is to channel the steam released from
the LOCA through the suppression pool, limiting the amount of steam released to the primary containment atmosphere.
This limits the containment pressurization due to the LOCA. The leakage of the drywell is limited to ensure that the
primary containment does not exceed its design limits of 185 
 F and 15 psig. Because the proposed change does not alter the plant design, only the frequency of measuring the
drywell leakage, the proposed change does not directly result in an increase in the drywell leakage. However, decreasing
the test frequency can increase the probability that a large increase in drywell bypass leakage could go undetected
for an extended period of time. There are several potential sources of steam bypass leakage paths. These include potential
cracks in drywell concrete structure, the drywell vacuum breakers, and various penetrations through the drywell
structure. Based on the results of the structural integrity test conducted as part of the preoperational test program,
additional cracking of the drywell is not expected during the remaining life of the plant. Ventilation and piping
penetrations (including the drywell vacuum breaker penetrations) are designed to ASME Code Class 2 and Seismic Category
1 requirements. These penetrations are designed with two isolation valves in series with one valve in the drywell
and another either outside primary containment or in the wetwell. High energy lines that extend into the wetwell,
such as the main steam lines and feedwater lines, are encapsulated by guard pipes to direct energy to the drywell in
case of a piping rupture. Electrical penetrations are sealed with a high strength/density material that will prevent
leakage as well as provide radiation shielding. Operational experience has shown that the leak tightness of the drywell
has maintained well below the allowable leakage limits. In fact, the calculated drywell bypass leakage area is of
such a small magnitude that containment design pressure could not be exceeded even if containment spray and heat sinks
were not available. The technical specification limit of 10% of the maximum allowable leakage path area provides
margin for degradation. Drywell performance data to date suggest that drywell degradation, even during a ten-year
interval between tests, will not exceed this margin.

Further, an analysis was conducted to determine the potential risk to the public from unacceptable drywell bypass
leakage going undetected as a result of the proposed change. Based on this analysis, under several different accident
scenarios, the risk of radioactivity release from containment was found to be negligible, about 10

^9

 per year.

Based on the above, Illinois Power has concluded that the proposed change will not result in a significant increase
in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

(2) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design or operation. As a result, the proposed change
does not affect any of the parameters or conditions that could contribute to initiation of any accidents. Thus, the
proposed change cannot create the possibility of an accident not previously evaluated.

(3) The proposed change only affects the frequency of measuring the drywell leakage and does not change the bypass
leakage limit for the drywell. However, the proposed change can increase the probability that a large increase in
drywell bypass leakage could go undetected for an extended period of time. Operational experience has shown that
the leak tightness of the drywell has been maintained well below the allowable leakage limits. In fact, the calculated
drywell bypass leakage area is of such a small magnitude that containment design pressure could not be exceeded even
if containment spray and heat sinks were not available. Further, an analysis was conducted to determine the potential
risk to the public from the proposed change. Based on this analysis, under several different accident scenarios,
the risk of radioactivity release from containment was found to be negligible, about 10

^9

 per year. As a result, Illinois Power has concluded that the proposed change will not result in a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois 





Date of amendment request: 

August 12, 1994.



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would modify Clinton Power Station Technical Specifications 3/4.3.1, ``Reactor Protection
System Instrumentation,'' 3/4.3.2, ``Containment and Reactor Vessel Isolation Control System,'' 3/4.3.3, ``Emergency
Core Cooling System Actuation Instrumentation,'' 3/4.3.4.2, ``End-of-Cycle Recirculation Pump Trip System Instrumentation,''
3/4.3.5, ``Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System Actuation Instrumentation,'' 3/4.4.2.1, ``Safety/Relief Valves,''
and 3/4.4.2.2, ``Safety/Relief Valves Low-Low Set Function.'' These technical specifications contain requirements
to perform manual testing of the associated solid-state logic at least once every four fuel cycles. This testing is
in addition to the automatic testing performed by the self-test system. Due to the negative impact on plant safety
caused by the need to remove systems from service to prevent unwanted actuations and the increased potential for unintended
equipment actuation during manual testing, Illinois Power is proposing that the requirement to perform manual testing
of the solid-state logic independently from the self-test system be eliminated.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:




(1) The proposed change does not involve a change to the plant design. The proposed change involves only testing of
the solid-state Nuclear Systems Protection System (NSPS) utilizing the self-test system (STS). As identified in
Supplement No. 2 to the Clinton Power Station (CPS) Safety Evaluation Report (SSER 2), use of the STS to perform certain
surveillance testing required by the plant Technical Specifications is acceptable. However, as noted in SSER 6,
portions of the NSPS logic must also be manually tested during each refueling outage independently from the STS such
that all NSPS trip/actuation functions are tested independently of the STS at least once every four fuel cycles. The
change proposed in this request consists of the elimination of this manual testing of the NSPS logic independently
from the STS.

As identified in SSER 6, the purpose of the currently required manual tests is to provide a means to verify operability
of the NSPS functional circuits independent of the STS, and thereby (1) detect any failures undetected by the STS and
take corrective action to restore proper operation of the NSPS and STS and (2) assuming that no additional failures
beyond those identified by the STS are detected during independent logic testing, confirm the validity of the STS
test results. The ability of the STS to detect functional failures of the NSPS logic as designed was verified as part
of General Electric's independent design verification. In addition, this capability was also verified by testing
as part of the preoperational test program as described in Section 14.2.12.1.62 of the CPS Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) and during testing performed during the first four refueling outages in accordance with the current
Technical Specification testing requirements. Thus, Illinois Power (IP) has concluded that all functional failures
undetectable by the STS have been identified and the aforementioned objectives have been satisfied.

Since the proposed change does not alter the plant design or operation, it cannot increase the probability of any accident
previously evaluated. This proposed change does involve the NSPS logic which is utilized to actuate systems needed
to mitigate the consequences of accidents previously evaluated, however, the proposed change merely eliminates
the currently required manual testing independently from the STS once every four fuel cycles. Since the proposed
change does not alter the NSPS logic, does not impact operation of the STS, and continues to require adequate testing
of the NSPS logic on a frequency sufficient to maintain the operability of the associated NSPS logic, the proposed
change cannot impact the reliability of the associated actuation instrumentation and therefore cannot increase
the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

(2) Adequate testing of the NSPS logic will continue to be required. The proposed change continues to allow us of the
STS in performing surveillance tests as documented by the NRC in SSER 2. However, additional manual tests independently
from the STS will no longer be required. Since the proposed change does not add additional testing configurations
or operating modes nor does it alter the plant design, it will not introduce any new failure modes. Thus, this proposed
change cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Performance of the currently required manual testing of the NSPS logic independently from the STS system involves
actuation logic for the reactor protection system, emergency core cooling systems (ECCS), reactor core isolation
cooling system, automatic depressurization system, nuclear steam supply shutoff system, and the residual heat
removal (RHR) system, including the shutdown cooling mode of operation. Performance of these tests requires these
systems to be disabled to prevent unwanted system actuations.Thus, these systems are rendered inoperable during
this testing. This also results in extensive temporary reconfiguration of systems and actuation instrumentation,
including logic card removal, installation of signal simulators, disconnecting load drivers, etc. The removal
of these safety systems from service to perform this testing results in reduced availability of RPS, ECCS, and RHR
shutdown cooling systems during the plant outage. In addition to the intentional disabling of equipment to perform
this testing, this testing has in the past led to safety system unavailability due to equipment damage caused by bending
pin connectors and burning circuit cards out due to electrical shorting. Further, CPS has experienced unintentional
equipment actuations resulting in unnecessary challenges to safety systems and the need to file licensee event reports
with the NRC. IP has concluded that elimination of this currently required manual testing of the NSPS will have a positive
impact on overall plant safety.

The only margin of safety that could be negatively impacted by this proposed change is the potential for a functional
failure in the NSPS logic going undetected. The manual tests proposed for deletion are only required to be performed
at least once every four fuel cycles. In addition, the ability of the STS to detect functional failures of the NSPS logic
as designed was verified as part of General Electric's independent design verification. Further, this capability
was also verified as part of the preoperational test program as described in Section 14.2.12.1.62 of the CPS Updated
Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and subsequently during testing performing during the first four refueling outages.
These manual tests did not identify any functional failures of the NSPS logic which would be expected to be detected
by the STS per its design. All other functional failures undetectable by the STS have been identified as Untested Islands
(UTIs). Thus, the original objectives of this testing have been satisfied.

The proposed change will continue to require testing at refueling outage intervals. As identified in USAR Section
7.2.1.1.4.8 and SSER 6, circuits which are not capable of being tested by the STS are identified as UTIs. General Electric
and IP have identified, via analysis and manual testing, all UTIs in the functional NSPS logic and have established
procedures for testing these UTIs. Periodic verification of the operability of these UTIs will continue to be performed
at the frequencies recommended by the manufacturer as accepted by the NRC in SSER 6. These frequencies were established
by the manufacturer based on mean time between failure analyses for the components in the associated circuits and
may be as long as six years. Based on the above, the functional operability of the NSPS logic is adequately assured.

From the above, IP has concluded that the proposed change will result in a net increase in the overall margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

of ``backup'' fire suppression water. 


Criterion 3 


This update of the fire protection modifications contained in Table 1 of the July 31, 1979, fire protection SER does
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as follows: 
Item 7C_The use of an air compressor rather than the cascade recharging stations does not adversely impact the ability
to supply breathing air for the fire brigade and is acceptable under BTP APCSB 9.5-1. Filled spare breathing
air bottles are on-site and the local municipal department will provide assistance as needed.

Date of amendment request:

 July 19, 1994 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by removing the specific scheduling requirements
for Types A, B, and C tests and replacing these requirements with a requirement to perform Types A, B, and C testing in
accordance with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


Criterion 1 


This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the proposed changes to the T/Ss do not affect the assumptions, parameters, or results
of any UFSAR accident analysis. The proposed changes do not modify the response of the containment during a design
basis accident. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing equipment. The proposed Types A, B, and
C testing schedules will be consistent with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Based on these considerations, it is concluded
that the changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 


Criterion 2 


The proposed changes do not involve physical changes to the plant or changes in plant operating configuration. The
proposed changes only remove the restrictive schedular requirements for conducting Type A testing from the T/Ss
and substitute the schedule specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. For Types B and C testing, the schedular requirements
are removed from T/Ss because they are already specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed
changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



Criterion 3 


The margin for safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed change in the schedular requirements for Type
A tests. Types B and C schedular requirements are not changed by removing them from T/Ss. Although the changes allow
more flexibility in scheduling Type A tests, the proposed amendment continues to ensure reactor containment system
reliability by periodic testing in full compliance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix J. Based on these considerations, it is
concluded that the changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Date of amendment request:

 July 26, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would modify the technical specifications such that the requirement to measure the moderator
temperature coefficient near the end of the cycle will become conditional. The test will not be performed if specified
core performance benchmark criteria are met for the operating cycle, and the revised predicted moderator temperature
coefficient is less negative than the moderator temperature coefficient surveillance limit presented in the Core
Operation Limits Report. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


Criterion 1 


Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated? 
No. The conditional exemption of the most negative MTC measurement does not change the most negative MTC surveillance
and LCO limits in the T/Ss. Since these MTC values are unchanged, and since the basis for the derivation of these values
from the safety analysis MDC is unchanged, the constant MDC assumed for the FSAR safety analyses will also remain unchanged.
Therefore, no change in the modeling (i.e., probabilities) of the accident analysis conditions or response is necessary
in order to implement the change to the conditional exemption methodology. In addition, since the constant MDC assumed
in the safety analyses is not changed by the conditional exemption of the most negative MTC surveillance measurement,
the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR are not increased. The dose predictions presented
in the FSAR for a SGTR remain valid such that more severe consequences will not occur. Additionally, since mass and
energy releases for LOCA and steamline break are not increased as a result of the unchanged MDC, the dose predications
for these events presented in the FSAR also remain bounding. 


Criterion 2 


Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated? 
No. Since the EOL MTC is not changed by the conditional exemption methodology of Reference 1, the possibility of an
accident which is different than any already evaluated in the FSAR has not been created. No new or different failure
modes have been defined for any system or component nor has any new limiting single failure been identified. Conservative
assumptions for MDC have already been modeled in the FSAR analyses. These assumptions will remain valid since the
conditional exemption methodology documented in Reference 1 does not change the safety analysis MDC nor the T/S values
of the MTC. 


Criterion 3 


Does the EOL MTC measurement conditional exemption involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
No. The evaluation of the conditional exemption methodology documented in Reference 1 has taken into account the
applicable Cook Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 T/Ss and has bounded the conditions under which the specifications permit
operation. The applicable T/Ss are surveillance 4.1.1.4, and reference ``e'' is added to the list of references in
Specification 6.9.1.11.2. An additional specification 6.9.1.12 is added to define the requirements for the ``Most
Negative Moderator Temperature Coefficient Limit Report,'' which is described in Appendices A, C, and D of Reference
1. The COLR has also been modified as described in Appendix B of Reference 1. The analyses which support these T/Ss have
been evaluated. The results, as presented in the FSAR, remain bounding since the MDC assumed in the safety analyses
and the LCO and surveillance requirement MTCs in the T/Ss remain unchanged. Therefore, the margin of safety, as defined
in the bases to these T/Ss, is not reduced. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-220, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1, Oswego County,
New York 




Date of amendment request: 

August 26, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment to Technical Specification 4.3.3.c(1) would allow a one-time extension of the 10 year service
period for the Primary Containment Integrated Leakage Rate (Type A) Test. Specifically, the proposed one-time only
change would extend the 
10-year service interval requirement for performance of the Type A test to correspond with the end of the current inservice
inspection interval (ISI). The interval extension would avoid the necessity of performing an additional Type A test
only 22 months after the previous test. This would result in an extension of the second interval from 10 years to approximately
14 years and 46 months between the second and third test. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 





The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed extension of the Type A test 10-year service interval does not increase the chances for a previously analyzed
accident to occur. Containment integrity is required for the mitigation of accident consequences. Furthermore,
containment leakage is not the precursor to any analyzed event. Extension of the Type A test surveillance interval
will not affect the containment's ability to maintain leakage below that assumed in the safety analysis. The previous
Type A test was completed successfully and no plant modifications have been made or are planned (other than those that
require Type B or C testing) since the last test which could directly affect the test results. Type B and C testing of
individual penetrations has been satisfactory and will continue to be performed in accordance with the Technical
Specifications. There have been no pressure or temperature excursions in the containment which could have adversely
affected containment integrity. Hence, the ability of containment to maintain leakage within the Type A test limits
be maintained. 
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed one-time extension of the Type A test 10-year service interval will not affect the test methodology or
acceptance criteria nor does it alter the physical containment structure or boundary in any way. There will be no addition
or removal of plant hardware. No new plant operating modes are being introduced. Results of the previous Type A tests
are well below allowable limits, and there have been no plant modifications (other than those that require Type B or
C testing) since the last test nor are any planned, that could directly impact the previous Type A test results. 
Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different accident from any previously
evaluated. 
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. 
Safety margins are established through the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 safety analyses as reflected in the Technical Specification
Limiting Conditions for Operation. Containment leak rates assumed in the safety analyses are not increased by the
proposed change to the Type A test 10-year service interval. The acceptance criteria which must be met to verify that
leak rates remain within assumed values will not be changed. 
Although the test frequency will be relaxed for the one-time extension, no plant modifications have been made or are
planned which would invalidate the last Type A leak test results which confirm acceptable containment integrity.
Furthermore, Type B and C testing of individual penetrations has been satisfactory and will continue to be performed
in accordance with the Technical Specifications to assure that containment integrity is maintained. 
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of a safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 26, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise Technical Specification (TS) Section 3/4.6.1.3, ``Primary Containment Air Locks.''
Specifically, TS 3/4.6.1.3 would be revised to allow continued plant operation if an interlock becomes inoperable
as long as an operable door is locked shut and periodically checked as being locked shut. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 





The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The primary containment and containment air locks are not initiators or precursors to an accident. Primary containment
integrity ensures that the release of radioactive materials from the containment will be restricted to those leakage
paths and associated leak rates assumed in the accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes to the air lock
ACTION statements cannot affect the probability of a previously evaluated accident. 
The purpose of a primary containment air lock interlock is to allow only one door to be opened at a time in each penetration.
This provision ensures that a gross breach of primary containment does not exist when primary containment is required
to be operable. Closure of a single door in each air lock is sufficient to provide a leak tight barrier following postulated
events. If an air lock interlock is inoperable, the proposed ACTION requires that an operable door be locked shut and
periodically verified locked and shut. This assures that at least one air lock door is closed, which provides the function
of the interlock, thereby assuring containment integrity is maintained. Therefore, the proposed change will not
significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes to the primary containment air lock specification will allow contained plant operation with
an inoperable interlock as long as an operable door is locked closed and periodically verified to be locked closed.
The changes do not introduce any new accident precursors and do not involve any alterations to plant configurations
which could initiate a new or different kind of accident. The change provides an alternate means of ensuring that only
one primary containment air lock door is opened at a time in each penetration. Therefore, the proposed changes will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant

The proposed changes to the primary containment air lock ACTION statements will not affect the ability of the containment
to respond to an accident and limit releases to within 10 CFR Part 100 and GDC [General Design Criterion] 19 guidelines.
The changes do not affect the design or performance characteristics of the containment or containment air locks but
simply provide an alternative means of ensuring that only one air lock door is opened at a time. Therefore, the proposed

Nos. 1 and 2, Oswego County, New York 







Date of amendments request:

 June 9, 1994. 





Description of amendments request:

 The proposed change would revise Section 3.4, ``Response Force Capabilities,'' of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station
Physical Security Plan with regard to the number of armed Security Force Members comprising the Response Force for
each shift. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 








The operation of Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.



The proposed amendment to the Physical Security Plan involves a change in the armed response force size for Units 1
and 2. Nuclear Security's ability to meet the response requirements of 10 CFR [subsection] 73.55(h) will not be significantly
affected as was determined utilizing NUREG-0907 while taking into consideration several Security Program
enhancements implemented since 1986 when response force size was last reviewed. 



The change does not affect the design, function, operation, maintenance or testing of structures, systems and components
at Unit 1 or Unit 2. It does not affect safety analysis or any Technical Specification that preserves a safety analysis
assumption. Therefore, the proposed amendment will neither increase the probability nor the consequences of an
accident previously evaluated. 



The operation of Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



The proposed amendment to the Physical Security Plan involves a change in the size of the response force for Units 1
and 2. Design, function, operation, maintenance and testing of structures, systems and components at Units 1 and
2 are not affected. Also, as demonstrated using NUREG-0907, Nuclear Security will continue to meet the requirements
of 10 CFR [subsection] 73.55(h). Therefore, the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



The operation of Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2 in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. 



The proposed amendment to the Physical Security Plan involves a change in the size of the armed response force for Units
1 and 2. The proposed change has no impact on the physical design of the plants nor on the function or operation of their
structures, systems and components. The proposed amendment does not impact and therefore does not reduce the margin
of safety as defined in the basis for any Unit 1 or Unit 2 Technical Specification.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 September 1, 1994.
 





Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications concerning the Reactor Coolant System Volume (RCS).





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
(SHC), which is presented below: 






* * * The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not: 



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



The proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications revises the total RCS water
and steam volume to reflect the installation of new steam generators. Section 5.0 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications delineates design features for Millstone Unit No. 2. The proposed change does not modify a limiting
condition for operation, action statement, or surveillance requirement. Additionally, the proposed change does
not revise the manner in which the plant is operated. It simply revises the value delineated for the total RCS water
and steam volume. 



The steam generator replacement modifications were addressed in a plant design change request performed in accordance
with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59. NNECO concluded that the replacement of the steam generators did not involve
an unreviewed safety question. This proposed change is a result of those modifications. 


Based on the above, the proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications does
not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 



The proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications simply revises the total
RCS water and steam volume to reflect the installation of new steam generators. It does not modify the manner in which
any plant equipment or systems are operated. Thus, the proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2
Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 



3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 



The proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications revises the total RCS water
and steam volume to reflect the installation of new steam generators. This proposal simply reflects the slight change
in volume due to the replacement of the steam generators. The steam generator replacement modifications were addressed
in a plant design change request performed in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59. NNECO concluded that
the replacement of the steam generators did not involve an unreviewed safety question. 






Based on the above, the proposed change to Section 5.4.2 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications does
not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-387 and 50-388 Susquehanna Steam Electric Station,
Unit 1, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania 







Date of amendment request:

 August 22, 1994. 





Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would change Technical Specifications 3/4.1.3: to extend the scram discharge volume (SDV)
vent or drain valve restoration time from the current time period of 24 hours to 7 days; to permit the SDV vent and drain
valves operability check to be performed at shutdown conditions instead of at least once per 18 months; and to delete
the SDV float switch response surveillance. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 




I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 



The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable
vent and/or drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated. A 7 day restoration time, as identified in NUREG 1433, is reasonable given the level
of redundancy in the lines and the low probability of a scram occurring while the valve is inoperable and the line is
not isolated. If the inoperable valve fails open, the redundant valve in the line allows for leakage from the CRD [control
rod driveline] to be drained out and also allows for the line to be isolated if necessary. If the valve fails closed,
the line becomes isolated. However, float switches and pressure sensors will notify operators of water buildup in
the instrument volume. A review of the surveillance data indicates the vent and drain valves rarely fail the initial
operability test and require rework. The low failure rate combined with the redundancy of the valves makes for a highly
reliable system. Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 



Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability
during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions
does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose
of the 50% rod density requirement is to provide a test environment having typical reactor coolant pressure and temperature
conditions. However, the closure time of the vent and/or drain valves is not affected by pressure and any variations
due to temperature are relatively insignificant. Therefore, testing from shutdown conditions ensures the safety
functions of the vent and drain valves are met. Also, the proposed change does not affect system design or operation.
Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 



The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float
switch actuation after a scram, does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. Design changes eliminated the high differential pressure experienced by the float switches after a scram
and provide redundant level measuring instrumentation. Differential pressure gauges were added in addition to
the float switches to provide the RPS [reactor system protection] logic with a diverse and redundant means of measuring
SDIV [SDV] level. The changes have resulted in no crushed ball floats at SSES after a scram. The proposed change will
have a negligible effect [on] the reliability of the system and therefore, does not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 



The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable
vent and/or one inoperable drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Extending the restoration time to 7 days does not change
the design purpose or operation of the SDV valves. Therefore, the change is bounded by the existing accident analysis.




Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability
during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Performing
the surveillance from shutdown conditions, as recommended in NUREG 1366, ensures that the operability of the SDV
is maintained. No new failure modes are introduced by the change and the change is bounded by the existing accident
analysis. 



The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float
switch actuation after a scram, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The role of the ball floats to sense increases in SDV water level is not affected by the change.
In the unlikely event that crushing of the ball float were to occur, redundant level measuring devices would maintain
system function and the existing 92 day surveillance activity would identify a ball float failure. 



III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable
vent and/or one inoperable drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. A 7 day completion time, as identified in NUREG 1433, is reasonable given the level of redundancy in the lines
and the low probability of a scram occurring while the valve is inoperable and the line is not isolated. Also, a separate
Technical Specification (3.1.3.1.e) addresses the potential for two inoperable vent or drain valves in the same
line. 



Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability
during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change maintains the intent of S.R. 4.1.3.1.4.a
by performing equivalent testing at the same frequency. The change increases the margin of safety by eliminating
potential future scrams taken to meet S.R. 4.1.3.1.4.a., thus reducing the potential for safety challenges.

The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float
switch actuation after a scram does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Design changes have
enhanced the SDV design and provide a redundant and diverse means of monitoring SDV level. Also, a 92-day surveillance
(S.R. 4.3.1.1) ensures the operability of the float switch. 








The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, San Diego County, California 







Date of amendment requests: 

December 30, 1993, June 3, 1994, and August 25, 1994.





Description of amendment requests: 

The licensee proposes to replace the current Technical Specifications (TS) with a set of TS based on the CE Owners Group
Improved Standard Technical Specifications issued by the NRC staff as NUREG-1432 in September 1992. The adoption
of Owners Group-approved TS is part of an industry-wide initiative to standardize and improve TS. San Onofre, Units
2 and 3, is the lead plant for adoption of the CE Owners Group standardized TS. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:







1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?




The proposed change relocates requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components or variables
which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in Technical Specifications. The affected structures, systems, components
or variables are not assumed to be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient
events. The requirements and surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will
be relocated from the Technical Specifications to the Licensee Controlled Specifications or the UFSAR [updated
final safety analysis report]. These operability requirements and surveillances will continue to be maintained
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in
existing surveillance procedures which are controlled by 10 CFR 50.59. The reformatting and rewording process involves
no technical changes to plant design or operations. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?




The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment
will be installed) or changes in parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will not impose
any different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. Thus, this change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 



The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analyses assumptions.
In addition, the affected structure, system, component or variable requirements and surveillances are the same
as the existing Technical Specifications. Since any future changes to these requirements in the Licensee Controlled
Specifications or UFSAR in the surveillance procedures will be evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, no
significant reduction in a margin of safety will be allowed. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendments request: 

August 17, 1994.





Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Surveillance Requirement 4.3.1.2, Reactor Trip System Instrumentation, and
Surveillance Requirement 4.3.2.1, Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System Instrumentation, to eliminate
the periodic pressure sensor response time testing requirements. The Surveillance Requirements would indicate
that the total channel response time will be periodically ``verified'' instead of ``tested''. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:







1. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated. 



This change to the Technical Specifications does not result in a condition where the design, material, and construction
standards that were applicable prior to the change are altered. The same RTS and ESFAS instrumentation is being used;
the time response allocations/modeling assumptions in the FSAR Chapter 
15 analyses are still the same; only the method of verifying time response is changed. Periodic calibration of these
pressure and differential pressure instruments will detect significant degradation in the sensor response characteristic
and assure equipment operability. Flushing of selected sensing lines during each refueling outage as recommended
by NUREG/CR5851, ``Long Term Performance and Aging Characteristics of Nuclear Plant Pressure Transmitters,''
will mitigate sensing line response time degradation due to blockage that noise analysis testing techniques would
have previously detected. The proposed change will not modify any system interface and could not increase the likelihood
of an accident since these events are independent of this change. The proposed activity will not change, degrade or
prevent actions or alter any assumptions previously made in evaluating the radiological consequences of an accident
described in the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 



2. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 



This change does not alter the performance of the pressure and differential pressure transmitters and switches used
in the plant protection systems. All sensors will still have response time verified by test before placing the sensors
in operational service and after any maintenance that could affect response time. Changing the method of periodically
verifying instrument response for certain sensors from time response testing to calibration will not create any
new accident initiators or scenarios. Implementation of the proposed amendment does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. 



This change does not affect the total system response time assumed in the safety analysis. The periodic system response
time verification method for selected pressure and differential pressure sensors is modified to allow use of actual
test data or engineering data. The method of verification combined with sensing line preventative maintenance provides
assurance that the total system response is within the time limit defined in the safety analysis, since calibration
tests will detect any degradation which might significantly affect pressure sensor response time and periodic sensing
line flushing will minimize the potential for long-term buildup of contaminants which may impact sensing line response.
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a reduction in margin
with respect to plant safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 30, 1994 (TS 318). 





Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment consists of six parts, which the licensee has designated ``A'' through ``F'' in the analysis
of no significant hazards considerations presented below. The six parts are: 



A. Mechanical pressure and differential pressure indicating switches in the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and
Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) are being replaced with an Analog Transmitter/Trip System (ATTS) for the Browns
Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Unit 3. 



B. The BFN Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit is being revised to reflect the analytical limit provided
by General Electric and the Level 1 Low Reactor Vessel Water Level setpoint is being revised to provide a more conservative
limit. 



C. For BFN Unit 2, RPS and ECCS instrument identifiers are being added or corrected to enhance useability of the Technical
Specifications. These changes do not reflect a change in equipment, operation of the associated system, or the safety
function of that system.

D. For BFN Unit 2, Reactor High Water Level, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) and High Pressure Coolant Injection
(HPCI) Turbine Steam Line High Flow, and Drywell Pressure instrumentation calibration frequencies and functional
test descriptions are being revised to reflect current calculations and test methods. These changes do not reflect
a change in equipment, operation of the associated system, or the safety function of that system. 


E. For BFN Units 1, 2, and 3, the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates the pressure suppression
chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, calibration frequency is being revised. In addition, tables that specify
the minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required, remarks,
functional test, and instrument check are being added. 


F. Corrects the capitalization of terms used on the affected BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS pages in order to conform with the
current TS Definitions section. This part also corrects spelling and capitalization of other words on the same pages.





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 





1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 




Part A: 

The Unit 3 modification, which involves the installation of an Analog Transmitter/Trip System (ATTS), replaces
older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function. 


The initiation of control rod insertion to mitigate a design basis accident is contained in Chapter 14 of the BFN Final
Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). There is no change in design bases, protective function (initiation of control rod
insertion), redundancy, setpoints, or logic associated with the installation of the ATTS. The consequences of a
failure of this equipment are no different than that of the original equipment. Since there is no change in any protective
functions, nor the creation of any new operational conditions, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 




Part B: 

The revision to the Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit and the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level
setpoint do not reflect any change in plant equipment. The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical
safety limit calculated by General Electric. 


The Level 1 low reactor vessel water level trip initiates the Core Spray and Low Pressure Coolant Injection Systems
and isolates the Main Steam lines. These actions are taken to mitigate the consequences of a Loss of Coolant Accident.
The change in the setpoint affects the timing of the operation of equipment necessary to mitigate the consequences
of an accident. A setpoint calculation has been generated which ensures these safety functions are initiated in accordance
with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously
evaluated. 




Part C: 

The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification
to plant equipment. These administrative changes do not reflect any change to any precursor for the design basis events
or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. There is also no change to any protective function or
mitigating action for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore,
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. 




Part D: 

The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) instrumentation functional
test descriptions reflects the equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed.



The changes in calibration frequencies are being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. There are no modifications
to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. The calibration frequencies
specified by the current setpoint calculations ensure that the associated safety functions are initiated in accordance
with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).
Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.





Part E: 

The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates
the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations.
The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required,
remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. There are no modifications
to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. The calibration frequencies
specified by the current setpoint calculations ensure that the associated safety functions are initiated in accordance
with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).
Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.





Part F: 

The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section
is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling
and capitalization of other words on the same pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification
to plant equipment. These administrative changes do not reflect any change to any precursor for the design basis events
or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. There is also no change to any protective function or
mitigating action for the design basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore,
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 


Part A:

 The installation of the ATTS replaces older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function.
No new control functions are added. No credible equipment failure modes or single failure are introduced which could
result in the inability of redundant safety components or systems to perform their safety functions in accordance
with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



Part B: 

The revision to the Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit and the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level
setpoint do not reflect any change in plant equipment. The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical
safety limit calculated by General Electric. 

The change in the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint affects the timing of the operation of equipment necessary
to mitigate the consequences of an accident. No new failure modes or system interactions are introduced. The same
protection functions will still occur at the Level 1 low reactor water level setpoint. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



Part C: 

The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification
to plant equipment. The correction of instrument identifiers does not require new system alignments, modifications,
or changes in operating procedures. Therefore, no new external threats, system interactions, release pathways,
equipment failure modes, or types of operator errors are created. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



Part D: 

The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and RCIC instrumentation functional test descriptions reflects the
equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed. The changes in calibration frequencies
are being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes
in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. No new failure modes or system interactions are introduced.
The same protection functions will still occur at the same setpoints. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



Part E: 

The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates
the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations.
The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required,
remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. There are no modifications
to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. No new failure modes or system
interactions are introduced. The same protection functions will still occur at the same setpoints. Therefore, the
proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 



Part F: 

The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section
is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling
and capitalization of other words on the same pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification
to plant equipment. The correction of spelling and capitalization does not require new system alignments, modifications,
or changes in operating procedures. Therefore, no new external threats, system interactions, release pathways,
equipment failure modes, or types of operator errors are created. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



Part A: 

The installation of the ATTS replaces older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function.
The replacement equipment will improve reliability, accuracy and response times. There are no changes in the systems'
design basis, protective function, or logic arrangement. Instrument setpoints and calibration frequencies are
supported by Unit 3 specific calculations. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.

Part B: 

The revision to the Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit and the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level
setpoint do not reflect any change in plant equipment. The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical
safety limit calculated by General Electric. 

The change in the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint is supported by a Unit 3 specific setpoint calculation
that has been performed in accordance with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105, Instrument Setpoints
for Safety Related Systems. 
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 


Part C: 

The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification
to plant equipment. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.


Part D: 

The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and RCIC instrumentation functional test descriptions reflects the
equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed. The changes in calibration frequencies
are being made to reflect Unit 2 specific setpoint calculations. These calculations have been performed in accordance
with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes
in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety. 


Part E: 

The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates
the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations.
The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required,
remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. The setpoint calculations
have been performed in accordance with the methodology endorsed by Regulatory Guide 1.105. There are no modifications
to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 


Part F: 

The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section
is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling
and capitalization of other words on the same 
pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. Therefore, the proposed
amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 31, 1994 (TS 339).


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment consists of five parts, which the licensee has designated ``A'' through ``E'' in the discussion
of no significant hazards considerations, below. These five parts are: 
A. For the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3, improve operating flexibility by expanding the allowable
operating domain. This expansion is accomplished by revising the equations for the flow-biased Average Power Range
Monitor (APRM) flux scram trip setting and the APRM rod block trip setting. 
B. Revises the Rod Block Monitor (RBM) limiting conditions for operation (LCOs) to require two RBM channels to be operable
if the plant is operating with low thermal margins. 
C. Miscellaneous editorial changes to the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 technical specifications (TS). 
D. Revises the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS to delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate. 
E. Revises the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 TS to relocate the specific equations for the APRM rod block and RBM upscale setpoint
equations from the TS to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR).

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 


Part A: 

The proposed change will permit expansion of the current allowable power/flow operating region to allow operation
in the extended load line limit (ELLL) region. Operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 in the ELLL region will not increase the
probability of any accident previously evaluated since the Average Power Range Monitor (APRM) system and flow-biased
scram setpoint are not identified as initiators of any design basis accidents or transients. Additionally, no credit
is taken for the APRM flow biased scram in any accident or transient analyses. Therefore, the proposed change can not
significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
TVA's analysis of operation in the ELLL region verified that the consequences of previously evaluated accidents
are within the acceptance criteria of the licensing basis. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase
in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


Part B: 

The proposed change does not increase challenges or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment,
or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. The proposed change does not change the function of the rod
block monitor (RBM) subsystem. The RBM subsystem will continue to block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel
safety limits are protected. The revised RBM limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements provide
increased assurance that the RBM will function to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed
change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
The revised RBM operability and surveillance requirements provide increased assurance that the RBM will block control
rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Accordingly, operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 with the
revised RBM upscale setpoint does not involve an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.



Part C: 

The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect any plant operations, equipment, or any safety-related activity.
These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying
information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these editorial changes do not involve an increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


Part D: 

The proposed change will delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate found in the limiting
safety system settings. This flow rate is in the TS to provide additional information, and is not a TS requirement.
The proposed change does not change the limiting safety system settings or alter the method for calculating the settings.
The proposed change does not affect or change operation of the plant, plant equipment, or any safety-related equipment.
The proposed change does not change the APRM rod block or trip settings, the method or frequency of calibration of the
APRM flow biased network, or any other operational features of the APRM system. The proposed change will only delete
an incorrect flow rate from the TS. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


Part E: 

The proposed change will remove specific equations for the APRM rod block and RBM upscale trip setpoints from the TS
and relocate them to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). Removing these equations from the TS does not affect
or change the APRM and RBM subsystems or the functions of these systems. The proposed change does not affect or change
operation of the plant, plant equipment, or any safety-related equipment. Accordingly, the proposed change does
not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
Removing the specific rod block equations from the TS does not change the requirements to comply with the limits of
these equations during plant operations, since the TS will reference the COLR as the source of the equations. The actions
to be taken in the event of noncompliance with the COLR-specified equations will also remain unchanged. Both the APRM
rod block and RBM subsystems will continue to block control rod withdrawal to prevent reactor power from increasing
to excess levels and to ensure that applicable limits of the plant safety analysis are met. Additionally, in accordance
with the requirements of TS 6.9.1.7, these equations will continue to be developed using NRC-approved methodologies
and will continue to ensure that applicable safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

Part A: 

Operation of BFN Unit 1 and 3 in the ELLL region does not create any new failure mode or sequence of events that can lead
to an accident of a different type than any previously evaluated. Operation in the ELLL region does not increase challenges
or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose failure could cause
an accident. Changing the equation for the flow-biased APRM scram trip setpoint does not change the function of the
APRM subsystem. The APRM scram trip setpoint will continue to initiate a scram to ensure that the fuel safety limit
is not exceeded. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated. 


Part B: 

The proposed change to the RBM operability and surveillance requirements does not create any new failure mode or sequence
of events that can lead to an accident of a different type than any previously evaluated. The proposed change does not
increase challenges or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose
failure could cause an accident. The proposed change does not change the function of the RBM subsystem. The RBM subsystem
will continue to block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed
change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



Part C: 

The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect any plant operations, equipment, or any safety-related activity.
These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying
information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these editorial changes do not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 


Part D: 

The proposed change will delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate found in a factor used
to calculate limiting safety system settings for the APRM rod block and trip settings. The proposed change does not
change the limiting safety system settings or alter the method for calculating the settings. The proposed change
does not affect or change operation of the plant. The proposed change does not change the APRM rod block or trip settings,
the method or frequency of calibration of the APRM flow biased network, or any other operational features of the APRM
system. The proposed change will only delete an incorrect flow rate that is required to be calculated and maintained
outside of the TS. 
Since there will be no change in plant operations, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 


Part E: 

Removal of the APRM rod block and RBM upscale setpoint equations does not change or affect any safety-related plant
equipment or its functions; or any equipment, systems, or setpoints designed to prevent or mitigate accidents. Removing
these rod block equations does not create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment
whose failure could cause an accident; and does not change the function and manner of operation of the APRM or RBM subsystems.
The APRM and RBM subsystems will continue to block control rod withdrawal to prevent reactor power from increasing
to excess levels and to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


Part A: 

Operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 in the ELLL region does not affect the ability of the plant safety-related trips or equipment
to perform their intended functions. Operation in the ELLL region will not cause any significant increase in offsite
radiation doses resulting from any analyzed event. Although this change increases the APRM flow-biased scram equation,
no credit is taken for this equation in the accident analyses. These analyses assume that transient events initiated
from less than rated conditions are terminated by the fixed 120% flux scram or other safety-grade scram signals. These
signals are not affected by the proposed change. Additionally, as noted above, TVA's analysis of operation in the
ELLL region determined that the consequences of previously evaluated accidents remain within the acceptance criteria
of the licensing basis. Therefore, this change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 


Part B: 

The proposed change does not change the function of the RBM system. The RBM system will continue to block control rod
withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. The proposed change does not affect plant operation,
design, or any safety-related activity or equipment. The proposed change does not affect or change any margin of safety.
The proposed change will actually increase the margin of safety by providing more conservative operability and surveillance
requirements for the RBM subsystem. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



Part C: 

The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect plant operation, design, or any safety-related activity or equipment.
These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying
information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Part D: 

The proposed change will delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate found in the limiting
safety system settings. The proposed change does not change the limiting safety system settings or alter the method
for calculating the settings. The proposed change does not affect or change any margin of safety. The proposed change
does not alter the APRM rod block or trip settings, nor does it change the combinations of power and flow conditions
which could produce the APRM flow biased rod block and scram trips. Furthermore, the value for rated loop recirculation
flow rate will continue to be contained in plant procedures which are controlled by the 10 CFR 50.59 process. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 


Part E: 

The proposed change to remove the APRM rod block and RBM upscale setpoint equations does not change the equations or
alter the method for calculating the equations. The proposed change does not change or affect any safety-related
plant equipment or its functions; or any equipment, systems, or setpoints designed to prevent or mitigate accidents.
Removing these rod block equations does not create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or
other equipment whose failure could cause an accident; and does not change the function and manner of operation of
the APRM or RBM subsystems. The requirements of TS 6.9.1.7 will continue to ensure that these equations are developed
using NRC-approved methodology, and are consistent with applicable limits of the plant safety analysis. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

August 9, 1994. 


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by eliminating the high negative neutron flux
rate trip function. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The deletion of the High Negative Neutron Flux Rate trip does not adversely affect the probability of any accident.
In fact, the deletion of this reactor trip is expected to reduce the probability of inadvertent reactor trips during
surveillance testing. 
The only previously evaluated accidents whose consequences could be potentially affected by this change are the
dropped rod events. Presently the High Negative Neutron Flux Rate trip function responds to these events by initiating
a reactor trip. Analyses of these events, using currently licensed analysis methodologies have demonstrated that
this trip function is not necessary. Although the scenarios for the various rod drop events without this trip function
differ from the existing event scenarios, the unit will either be safely shutdown or return to an acceptable reactor
power level, and as before, DNB does not occur. Therefore, the proposed changes would not have a significant effect
on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed changes remove a feature from the Reactor Trip System that is a potential source of inadvertent or unnecessary
reactor trips. While the changes delete an accident mitigation feature, they do not add new hardware to the units and
do not change plant operations; consequently, no new failure modes are introduced. Therefore, the removal of this
trip function cannot create the possibility of an [sic] new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



Because the changes only delete an unnecessary reactor trip and do not actually alter the plant, the proposed changes
do not affect the failure values for any system or component. Accident analyses have shown that all relevant, existing
event acceptance criteria have been satisfied without taking credit for the deleted reactor trip; therefore, the
event acceptance criteria are not being revised. Because neither the failure values nor the acceptance criteria
are affected, the proposed changes have no affect on the margin of safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Date of amendment request: 

August 12, 1994. 





Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Administrative Controls section of the technical specifications to reflect
changes to the licensee's organization, change the submittal due date for the Monthly Operating Report, and delete
provisions that will be relocated to other controlled documents. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:






1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 



The proposed changes are administrative in nature and reflect new organizational position titles, reassigned managerial
responsibilities, a change in the required submittal due date of the Monthly Operating Report, and the relocation
of selected Technical Specification Administrative Controls to licensee controlled documents. The proposed organizational
changes include manager position title updates as follows: ``Group Vice President, Nuclear Engineering and Operations''
changed to ``Group Vice President, Nuclear Production''; ``Vice President, Nuclear Operation'' changed to ``Vice
President of Nuclear Operations''; and ``Shift Supervisor'' changed to ``Shift Manager''. Manager responsibilities
remain unchanged except the annual management directive concerning the Shift Supervisor's control room command
function which is reassigned to the Group Vice President, Nuclear Production. Additionally, responsibilities
of the Vice President, Nuclear Operations and Plant Manager are proposed for reassignment to either the Vice President
of Nuclear Operations or the Plant Manager. In all cases, responsibilities will continue to be assigned to appropriately
qualified individuals. 



The proposed change in the submittal due date of the Monthly Operating Report is to provide additional time to facilitate
data compilation and report preparation, review and approval for two operating units. This change does not alter
any data or information already reported. 



The proposed administrative control relocations include details of minimum shift operations crew staffing, method
of onsite and offsite review and audit, selected reportable event actions, review of security and emergency plans
and associated implementing procedures, requirements for record retention, and program elements for radiation
protection, process control and radiological environmental monitoring. These administrative controls are addressed
by other regulatory requirements and are relocated to other licensee documents (i.e., Final Safety Analysis Report,
Emergency Plan, Security Plan, Offsite Dose Calculation Manual) which have adequate change control to ensure that
intended plant design/safety functions will be maintained. No design basis accidents are affected by these proposed
administrative changes as they do not impact nor affect accident analysis assumptions. Therefore, accident analyses
assumptions are preserved and there is no change in the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident.




2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 



The proposed changes to update organizational position titles and reassign responsibilities will not delete any
responsibility/function already designated in the Technical Specifications. All given management activities
will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. The proposed change in the submittal due date of the Monthly
Operating Report does not alter any data or information already reported. The administrative control relocations
retain adequate regulatory basis to ensure that intended plant design/safety functions will be maintained. These
changes are administrative in nature and do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component
in the plant. Accordingly, no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety,
nor have any new initiating events been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 



3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The proposed changes involve the Administrative Controls Section of the CPSES Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications
and provide for updating organizational position titles, reassigning managerial responsibilities/functions,
changing the required submittal due date for the Monthly Operating Report, and relocating administrative controls
to other controlled licensee documents. These changes are administrative in nature and do not directly affect any
protective boundaries nor impact the safety limits for the protective boundaries. The relocated requirements retain
adequate regulatory basis for continued proper administrative review and plant configuration control to ensure
that actions prescribed in plant operating procedures are maintained so as not to impact the plant's margin of safety.
Therefore, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri 







Date of amendment request: 

August 4, 1994. 





Description of amendment request: 

This proposed amendment would reflect changes in the boron dilution accident analysis to address Boron Dilution
Mitigation System (BDMS) time delays, the BDMS actuation setpoint uncertainty, and concerns regarding the applicability
of the assumed inverse count rate ratio (ICRR) curve. The Technical Specifications include: 



a. Changing Bases page 2-8, note** of Table 3.3-1, and note 12 of Table 4.3-1 to reflect ``flux multiplication''
rather than ``flux doubling;'' 



b. Revising note 9 of Table 4.3-1 to reflect the revised setpoint; 



c. Revising Bases page 3/4 4-1 to reflect new analysis assumptions. 





Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:






(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



The actuation setpoint decrease and administrative controls to isolate dilution sources if no reactor coolant loop
is in operation during Modes 3-5 reflect the new analysis assumptions. The initiating events are presented
in FSAR Section 15.4.6. The proposed changes affect only the time required for BDMS to mitigate the event and do not
affect the probability of any event initiators. 



Overall protection system performance will remain within the bounds of the accident analyses documented in FSAR
Chapter 15, WCAP-10961-P, and WCAP-11883 since no hardware changes are proposed. 



The BDMS will continue to function in a manner consistent with the above analysis assumptions and the plant design
basis. As such, there will be no degradation in the performance of nor an increase in the number of challenges to equipment
assumed to function during an accident situation. 



These Technical Specification revisions do not involve any hardware changes nor do they affect the probability of
any event initiators. There will be no change to normal plant operating parameters or accident mitigation capabilities.
Therefore, there will be no increase in the probability of any accident occurring due to the revised analysis. 



The results of this new analysis indicate that there is sufficient time for BDMS action to prevent a loss of plant shutdown
margin. Since plant shutdown margin is not lost, the minimum DNBR remains well above the safety analysis limit values,
no overpressurization occurs and, therefore, there are no fuel failures. The Technical Specification limits on
shutdown margin in Modes 3-5 will be met. The conclusions of NRC Generic Letter 85-05 and NSAC-183
remain valid (i.e., that gradual boron dilution events are self-limiting due to inherent reactivity feedback mechanisms).
Given the above, there will be no increase in the consequences of any accident. 



(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously evaluated. 



As discussed above, there are no hardware changes associated with these Technical Specification revisions nor are
there any changes in the method by which any safety-related plant system performs its safety function. The normal
manner of plant operation is unaffected. 



No new accident scenarios, transient precursors, failure mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced
as a result of these changes. There will be no adverse effect or challenges imposed on any safety-related system as
a result of these changes. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different type of accident is not created. 



(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The results of the new analysis show that there is sufficient time for BDMS action to prevent a loss of plant shutdown
margin. Since plant shutdown margin is not lost, the minimum DNBR remains well above the safety analysis limit values.
The Technical Specification limits on shutdown margin in Modes 3-5 will be met. There will be no effect on the
manner in which safety limits or limiting safety system settings are determined nor will there be any effect on those
plant systems necessary to assure the accomplishment of protection functions. There will be no impact on DNBR limits,
F

Q

, F-delta-H, LOCA PCT, peak local power density, or any other margin of safety. 



Based upon the preceding information, it has been determined that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications
do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes meet the requirements of 10CFR50.92(c)
and does not involve a significant hazards consideration.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Union Electric Company, Docket No. 50-483, Callaway Plant, Unit 1, Callaway County, Missouri 





Date of amendment request

: August 4, 1994.
 


Description of amendment request

: The proposed amendment would replace Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.6.2.2, Spray Additive System, with a new
TS 3/4.6.2.2 entitled Recirculation Fluid pH control (RFPC) System. The associated TS Surveillance Requirements
and the Bases would be revised. In addition, the Bases for the Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) System will be revised.




Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination

: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Overall protection system performance will remain within the bounds of the accident analyses documented in FSAR
Chapter 15, WCAP-10961-P, and WCAP-11883. 

The accidents evaluated in the FSAR that could be affected by this proposed change are those involving the pressurization
of the containment and associated flooding of the containment and recirculation of this fluid within the ECCS or the
Containment Spray System (i.e., large break LOCA, main steam line break inside containment, and feedwater line break
inside containment). The TSP-C will dissolve in the containment sump fluid resulting from these accidents
raising the pH of the fluid, which would initially be greater than or equal to 4.0 but less than 7.0 during the injection
phase of containment spray operation. The equilibrium spray pH during the recirculation phase resulting from this
change will be greater than or equal to 7.1. The pH range for the spray will be bounded by the range of 4.0 to 11.0 in the
current FSAR Section 3.11(B) for the postulated spray solution environment. Since the resulting pH level will be
closer to neutral using the TSP-C instead of NaOH, post-LOCA corrosion of containment components will
not be increased. The results of the current, post-LOCA hydrogen generation calculation will remain bounding.
There will not be an adverse radiation dose effect on any safety-related equipment. Thus, the potential for failures
of the ECCS or safety-related equipment following a LOCA will not be increased as a result of the proposed change. The
radiological consequences of changing from NaOH to TSP-C were reanalyzed using the current NRC methodology
presented in Revision 2 of the Standard Review Plan (NUREG-0800) Section 6.5.2. This reanalysis indicates
that the proposed change would result in reduced control room doses. Offsite doses would remain less than those currently
reported in FSAR Table 15.6-8. The offsite and control room doses will continue to meet the requirements of 10
CFR 100, 10 CFR 50 Appendix A GDC 19, SRP 15.6.5.II, and SRP 6.4.II. The dose reanalysis, combined with knowledge gained
from recent studies on the behavior of iodine in the post-LOCA environment, demonstrates that the deletion
of the Spray Additive System and replacement with a sump pH control system using TSP-C will not increase the reported
radiological consequences of a postulated LOCA. The proposed new pH control system will provide satisfactory retention
of iodine in the sump water, as well as provide adequate pH control to minimize the potential of chloride-induced stress
corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless steel components. 

The Containment Spray System will continue to function in a manner consistent with the plant design basis. There will
be no degradation in the performance of nor an increase in the number of challenges to equipment assumed to function
during an accident situation. 

These Technical Specification revisions do not affect the probability of any event initiators. There will be no change
to normal plant operating parameters, ESF actuation setpoints, or accident mitigation capabilities. Therefore,
these changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

The new Recirculation Fluid pH Control System is a passive system, i.e., no operator or automatic action is required
to actuate the system. There are no active components being added whose failure could prevent the new system from functioning.
The only new components being added are the TSP-C storage baskets. Seismic requirements have been included
in the design to ensure the structural integrity of the baskets will be maintained during a seismic event. 

No new accident scenarios, transient precursors, failure mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced
as a result of these changes. There will be no adverse effect or challenges imposed on any safety-related system as
a result of these changes. The use of dry sodium phosphates is allowed for adjustment of the post-LOCA sump solution
pH as discussed in SRP 6.1.1. Trisodium phosphate has a dissolution rate of 0.7 lbm/ft

2

-min in water at 160
 F (given in WCAP-12477, based on trisodium phosphate in the form of a solid block with no agitation of the
solution). The quantity of trisodium phosphate chosen will provide a minimum equilibrium sump pH of 7.1 following
dissolution and mixing. No new equipment performance burdens are imposed' however, there is the potential for an
unlikely, but possible, event in which an initially concentrated solution of TSP-C occupies the stagnant volume
of an inoperable sump. This situation would not last for long since, as the recirculated sump fluid is cooled in the
RHR heat exchangers, sufficient buoyancy-driven circulation within containment will result to displace the stagnant
solution and eventually yield a uniform, equilibrium solution. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different
type of accident is not created.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The radiological analysis performed for this proposed change, as discussed above, shows that there would be no impact
on the doses reported in FSAR Table 15.6-8. 

There will be no change to the DNBR Correlation Limit, the design DNBR limits, or the safety analysis DNBR limits discussed
in Bases Section 2.1.1. 
There will be no effect on the manner in which safety limits or limiting safety system settings are determined nor will
there be any effect on those plant systems necessary to assure the accomplishment of protection functions. There
will be no impact on DNBR limits, F

, F-delta-H, LOCA PCT, peak local power density, or any other margin of safety. 

Based upon the preceding information, it has been determined that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications
do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes meet the requirements of 10 CFR

Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, Nuclear Project No. 2, Benton County, Washington






Date of amendment request

: January 6, 1994.



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to (1) modify a table notation which would
allow reactor protection channels to be placed in an inoperable status for a defined period of time to allow conduct
of surveillance testing without requiring entry into the associated limiting condition for operation (LCO) action
requirements, and (2) delete the channel check requirements for the ``Reactor Steam Dome_High'' TS surveillance.




Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below: 

Regarding the proposed modifications to the Instrumentation Section table notations: 

1. 

Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated? 

The proposed revised notations to the TS Instrumentation Section tables clarify the current intent of the table notations
by allowing the conduct of surveillance testing without declaring the affected channels inoperable for a limited
period of time. In addition, the proposed changes make the wording of the table notations consistent with the Improved
Technical Specifications (ITS). The proposed changes do not affect the time that the current notations allow a channel
to be placed in an inoperable status, and thus do not affect the probability of an accident previously evaluated. In
addition, the proposed changes do not affect the current requirement that redundant instrumentation be operable
to accomplish the required function for the channel placed in an inoperable status. Thus, the proposed changes do
not affect the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


The proposed changes do not affect the operation or availability of equipment from the current TS, and therefore do
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 

The margin of safety affected by the proposed changes is the time that instrumentation required for plant protection
is unavailable to perform its required function(s). The proposed changes do not affect the time that the instrumentation
is allowed to be in an inoperable status during surveillance testing, and thus does not affect the availability of
required instrumentation. In addition, the proposed changes do not affect the current requirement that redundant
instrumentation remains operable, ensuring the required safety function remains operable during surveillance
testing. Thus, the margin of safety is not affected by the proposed changes. 

Regarding the proposed removal of the channel check requirement for the ``Reactor Vessel Steam Dome Pressure_High''
instrumentation: 

1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

<DOCNO> FR940928-2-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940928-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed removal of this channel check requirement would not affect the availability of the trip function associated
with the ``Reactor Vessel Steam Dome Pressure_High'' instrument, since the status of the channels is monitored by
existing annunciators. This ensures the instruments remain capable of performing their intended function. 
2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

 
The proposed change does not involve a physical modification to the facility or its equipment, nor does it result in
a change in the reliability of the equipment. The proposed change does not, therefore, create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. 

Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

 
The margin of safety associated with not performing channel checks on the ``Reactor Vessel Steam Dome Pressure_High''
instrument is defined by the plant response to accidents that depend on this instrument, which in turn is dependent
on the likelihood of availability of the trip function associated with this instrument. The proposed change does
not affect the availability of this instrument, since the operators have continuous indication of the instrument's
availability. Thus, the amendment does not affect the margin of safety. 
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear 
Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request:

 April 11, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.f, ``Minimum
Conditions for Criticality,'' in preparation for the licensee's extension of the fuel cycle from 12 to 18 months.
The proposed amendment would revise TS 3.1.f to specify that the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) shall be
no greater than 
5.0 
pcm/
 F when at or below 60% rated thermal power and shall be zero or negative when above 60% rated thermal power. The
proposed amendment also incorporates required actions to be implemented if the MTC specification is not met. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 


Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Changes to TS 3.1.f 


This change is being proposed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show that no significant hazards
exist. The proposed change will not: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
Moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) is a physical characteristic of the reactor core which affects the reactor's
response to transients. The MTC is not an accident initiator, therefore changing the allowed MTC to 5.0 pcm/
 F at or below 60% power, does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
To verify that an increased MTC would not increase the consequences of a previously evaluated accident, Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation (WPSC) reanalyzed the bounding 
MTC-related events found in Kewaunee's Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR). Those events are: 
1. Uncontrolled Rod Withdrawal at Intermediate Power 
(USAR Section 14.1.2) 
2. Rod Ejection at Hot Zero Power, Beginning of Cycle 
(USAR Section 14.2.6) 
3. Loss of External Electrical Load, Beginning of Cycle (USAR Section 14.1.9) 
4. Uncontrolled Boron Dilution (USAR Section 14.1.4) 
5. Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow, Locked Rotor (USAR Section 14.1.8) 
6. Loss of Reactor Coolant Flow, Both Pumps Trip (USAR Section 14.1.8) 
Events numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 above were reanalyzed to verify that the departure from nuclear boiling ratio (DNBR)
would not fall below the acceptance criterion of 1.300. In all five cases, an assumed MTC value of 5.0 pcm/
 F at or below 60% power increased the calculated DNBR value from the current USAR analyses. Therefore the existing
analyses associated with DNBR remain bounding. 
Event number 2 above was reanalyzed to ensure Kewaunee's peak clad temperature (PCT) would not exceed the required
acceptance criterion of 2700
 F. When this accident was reanalyzed using the positive MTC value of 5.0 pcm/
 F, the calculated PCT exceeded 2700
 F. Therefore it was necessary to decrease the allowable hot channel factor (FQ) from 9.0 to 8.2. This change in
allowable FQ reduces a bounding value for future Kewaunee core designs and does not have an adverse effect on plant
safety limits or settings. This FQ limit reduction for the accident of Rod Ejection at Hot Zero Power, Beginning of
Cycle, will be incorporated into the WPSC Reload Safety Methodology and Kewaunee's USAR. The results of the analysis
using a FQ of 8.2 and a MTC value of 5.0 pcm/
 F indicate a lower PCT than the previously bounding case. 
In addition, WPSC reviewed the effects of this change on Kewaunee's anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) analysis.
This review demonstrated that the ATWS analysis was found to include assumptions bounding Kewaunee's proposed MTC
limits.

The reanalyses of the six most limiting MTC-related transients and review of the ATWS event demonstrate that this
proposed change does not involve an increase in the potential consequences of any accidents previously evaluated.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The MTC is a physical characteristic of the reactor core and is not an accident initiator. A changed MTC changes the
reactor's response to the postulated transients in chapter 14 of Kewaunee's USAR. Therefore an MTC of 5.0 pcm/
 F at or below 60% rated thermal power does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from
any accident previously evaluated. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The six most limiting MTC-related transients in chapter 14 of the KNPP USAR were reanalyzed. Five of the six were reanalyzed
to verify the DNBR would not go below the DNBR acceptance criterion of 1.300. The results of these five DNBR-related
analyses demonstrate that the reanalyzed DNBR value is greater than the DNBR from the currently bounding safety analyses.
The sixth transient was reanalyzed to verify the PCT limit of 2700
 F would not be exceeded. Reanalysis of this sixth accident, Rod Ejection at Hot Zero Power and Beginning of Cycle,
indicated a need to lower the allowable hot channel factor (FQ). Reanalysis incorporating this more restrictive
FQ value resulted in a calculated PCT value of 2504
 F, which is less than the previous PCT value of 2585
 F. The new FQ limit will be incorporated into the next USAR revision, which will be submitted in accordance with
10 CFR 50.71. 
In addition, WPSC reviewed the effects of this change on Kewaunee's anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) analysis.
This review demonstrated that the ATWS analysis was found to include assumptions bounding Kewaunee's proposed MTC
limits. 
The reanalyses of the six most bounding transients and review of the ATWS event demonstrate that restricting the MTC
value to 5.0 pcm/
 F at or below 60% power does not reduce the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear 
Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin 




Date of amendment request:

 May 20, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.4, ``Steam
and Power Conversion System,'' by modifying and clarifying the operability requirements for the main steam safety
valves (MSSVs), auxiliary feedwater system (AFW), and the condensate storage tank system. The proposed amendment
would eliminate inconsistencies within Technical Specification Section 3.4 and would provide the basis for operation
of the AFW system below 15% reactor power. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 


Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Changes to Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.a ``Main Steam Safety
Valves'' 


The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
Currently, TS 3.4.a.1.A.2 requires five MSSV's to be operable prior to heating the reactor 

>

 350
 F. The proposed change requires a minimum of two MSSVs per steam generator to be operable prior to heating the
reactor coolant system 

>

 350 
 F, and five MSSVs per steam generator to be operable prior to reactor criticality. If these conditions cannot
be met within 48 hours, within 1 hour action shall be initiated to achieve hot standby within 6 hours, achieve hot shutdown
within the following 6 hours, and achieve and maintain the reactor coolant system temperature < 350
 F within an additional 12 hours. 
The MSSVs are relied upon to function in each of the following USAR analyzed accidents: Reactor Coolant Pump Locked
Rotor, Loss of External Electrical Load, Loss of Normal Feedwater, Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal
at Power, Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal From a Subcritical Condition, Steam Generator Tube
Rupture, and Anticipated Transients without Scram. 
The initial conditions in the analysis of a Loss of External Electrical Load Accident, Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident,
Uncontrolled Rod Withdrawal at Power Accident, Uncontrolled Rod Cluster Control Assembly Withdrawal from a Subcritical
Condition Accident and an Anticipated Transients without Scram Accident assume critical conditions. Because this
proposed TS requires all MSSVs to be operable prior to reactor criticality, there will be no adverse effect on the health
and safety of the public. 
Two operable MSSVs are capable of relieving the maximum steam generated during a Reactor Coolant Pump Locked Rotor
Accident or a Steam Generator Tube Rupture from a subcritical condition. The maximum required steam relief rate resulting
from a Steam Generator Tube Rupture is 270,000 lbm/hr, well below the relief capacity of 1,532,076 lbm/hr of two MSSVs
on a single steam generator. Also, this condition results in no increase in the radiological dose to the public. Two
MSSVs on one steam generator are capable of relieving the steam generated corresponding to approximately 20% reactor
power. This relief capacity is well above the maximum steam generation rate resulting from a Reactor Coolant Pump
Locked Rotor Accident from a subcritical condition. 
In all cases, the relieving capacity of the MSSVs exceeds the maximum steam generation rate, and reactor criticality
is not permitted unless all MSSVs are operable. Therefore, there is 
no adverse effect on the health and safety of the public and no significant increase [in the probability or] consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 


The USAR safety analysis assumes five MSSVs per steam generator are operable. However, as shown above, this change
results in no steam generator overpressure event or increase in the radiological dose. Therefore, this change will
not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. 




Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Changes to Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.b ``Auxiliary Feedwater
System'' 




The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not: 


(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


Current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and TS 3.4.b governing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators are being combined
and titled, ``Auxiliary Feedwater System.'' This change is consistent with the format of ``Westinghouse Standard
Technical Specifications,'' NUREG-1431. In addition to the formatting changes, a number of technical changes
are being proposed. These are: 




_The correction of an inconsistency between current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and current TS 3.4.6.2.A. 


_The addition of a seven (7) day Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for one steam supply to the turbine driven auxiliary
feedwater pump. 


_An addition to allow the AFW control switches located in the control room to be placed in the ``pull out'' position
and valves AFW-2A and AFW-2B to be in a throttled position when below 15% reactor power without declaring
the corresponding AFW train inoperable. 





An inconsistency currently exists between current TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 and current TS 3.4.b.2.A. TS 3.4.a.1.A.1 requires
the system piping and valves directly associated with providing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators
to be operable, with a corresponding 48 hour limiting condition for operation (LCO) action statement if this requirement
is not met. TS 3.4.b.2.A allows one auxiliary feedwater pump to be inoperable for 72 hours. This arrangement can cause
a conflict regarding which TS is applicable depending on which component in the auxiliary feedwater flowpath to the
steam generators is inoperable. By moving all TS action statements to TS 3.4.b, the inconsistency between TS 3.4.a.1.A.1
and TS 3.4.b.2.A will be eliminated. The requirement to maintain the operability of the system piping and valves directly
associated with providing auxiliary feedwater flow to the steam generators remains, but is being modified to prevent
removing both AFW supply headers from service for 48 hours. 


Proposed TS 3.4.b.2.A is being added to allow one steam supply to the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump to be
inoperable for seven days. This addition is consistent with ``Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications,''
NUREG-1431. The seven day completion time is reasonable based on the redundant steam supplies to the pump, the
availability of the redundant motor-driven AFW pumps, and the low probability of an event occurring that requires
the inoperable steam supply to the turbine driven AFW pump. For these reasons, this change will have no adverse affect
on the health and safety of the public. 


Proposed TS 3.4.b.5 permits the AFW Pump control switches located in the control room to be placed in the ``pull out''
position and valves AFW-2A and AFW-2B to be in a throttled position when below 15% reactor power without
declaring the corresponding AFW train inoperable. This change is proposed to resolve concerns regarding the cycling
of the AFW pumps and the throttling of valves AFW-2A and AFW-2B during plant startups and shutdowns. Analysis
shows that control room operators have a minimum of ten minutes to initiate auxiliary feedwater flow after a design
basis accident with no steam generator dryout or core damage. 


All accidents which rely on AFW flow for mitigation were reanalyzed to support this change. These analyses were completed
assuming an initial power of 100%. However, a 15% reactor power restriction has been implemented on placing the AFW
pump control switches located in the control room in the ``pull out'' position and throttling valves AFW-2A
and AFW-2B. This restriction in effect limits use of TS 3.4.b.5 to plant start-ups, shutdowns and other low power
operating conditions. 


This change alters the assumptions of the safety analysis for the Small-Break Loss of Coolant Accident, the Steam
Generator Tube Rupture and the Loss of Normal Feedwater due to their dependence on the AFW system to start and supply
AFW for heat removal. To support this change, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation performed an analysis of the
Small-Break 
Loss-of-Coolant Accident using the NOTRUMP code assuming ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary
feedwater. This analysis resulted in a Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) of 1053
 F from an initial power level of 100%. All other acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 were [also] met. This large
margin to the 2200
 F PCT limit supports ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. 


Furthermore, WPSC has analyzed the Loss of Normal Feedwater and the Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident assuming
delays in the initiation of auxiliary feedwater. The Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident with a ten minute delay in the
initiation of Auxiliary Feedwater does not result in any adverse condition in the core. It does not result in water
relief from the pressurizer safety valves, nor does it result in uncovering the tube sheets of the steam generators.
Also, at all times the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) remained greater than 1.30. The Steam Generator
Tube Rupture Accident with no auxiliary feedwater flow was also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that
neither steam generator empties of liquid and at least 20
 F of reactor coolant system subcooling is maintained throughout the transient. Also, there is no increase in
the radiological dose to the public. 


Ten minutes is an acceptable time for operator action because four independent alarms in the control room would initiate
operator action to place the AFW pump control switches to the ``auto'' position and initiate AFW flow to the steam generators
when necessary. These include two steam generator lo level alarms (one per steam generator), and two steam generator
lo-lo level alarms (one per steam generator). Provisions also exist to add additional low level alarms on the plant
process computer. In addition to these alarms, control room operators have twelve other indications of insufficient,
or no, AFW flow to the steam generators. These indications include three auxiliary feedwater pump low discharge pressure
alarms (one per AFW pump), two auxiliary feedwater flow meters (one per steam generator), two AFW pump motor amp meters
(one per motor-driven AFW pump), two ``ESF in Pullout'' alarms (one per Engineered Safety Features train) and three
pump running lights (one per AFW pump). The ten minutes for operator action was discussed in a telephone conversation
between WPSC and Mr. R. Laufer (NRR). Ten minutes for operator action is further supported by Branch Technical Position
EISCB 18. Scenarios have been completed on the KNPP simulator to support ten minutes for 
operator initiation of AFW flow. In all cases, operators manually initiated AFW flow within the allowed ten minutes.



For these reasons, this change will have no adverse affect on the health and safety of the public or significantly increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the USAR. 


(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 


The proposed change does not alter the plant configuration, operating setpoints, or overall plant performance.
Therefore, it does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 


(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

This change alters the assumptions of the safety analysis for the Small-Break Loss of Coolant Accident, the Steam
Generator Tube Rupture and the Loss of Normal Feedwater due to their dependence on the AFW system to start and supply
AFW flow for heat removal. To support this change the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has performed an analysis
of the Small-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident using the NOTRUMP code assuming ten minutes for operator action to initiate
auxiliary feedwater. This analysis resulted in a Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) of 1053
 F from an initial power level of 100%. All other acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 were [also] met. This large
margin to the 2200
 F PCT limit supports ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. 


Furthermore, WPSC has analyzed the Loss of Normal Feedwater and the Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident assuming
delays in the initiation of auxiliary feedwater. The Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident with a ten minute delay in the
initiation of Auxiliary Feedwater does not result in any adverse condition in the core. It does not result in water
relief from the pressurizer safety valves, nor does it result in uncovering the tube sheets of the steam generators.
Also, at all times the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) remained greater than 1.30. The Steam Generator
Tube Rupture Accident with no Auxiliary Feedwater flow was also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that
neither steam generator empties of liquid and at least 20
 F of reactor coolant system subcooling is maintained throughout the transient. Also, there is no increase in
the radiological dose to the public. 


For these reasons, these changes will not adversely effect the health and safety of the public or involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety. 




Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Administrative Changes to Section TS 3.4 ``Steam and Power Conversion
System'' 




The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist.
The proposed changes will not: 


(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or 


(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or 


(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 


The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore,
no significant hazards exist. 

Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(i) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e.(i) states that changes
which are purely administrative in nature; i.e., to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications,
correct an error, or a change in nomenclature, are not likely to involve a significant hazard. 





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards Consideration 
and Opportunity for a Hearing 
(Exigent Public Announcement or Emergency Circumstances) 




During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 


Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 


For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register

 notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments. 


In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.

Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 

The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated. 

For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 

The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By October
28, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to (

Project Director

): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License
and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Haddam Neck Plant located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise various technical specification sections and the associated Bases sections
to reflect the changes to the shutdown margin requirement for Modes 4 and 5 and the boron dilution setpoint to assure
that the required margin for operator action in a boron dilution accident is met.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By Oct. 27, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, CT 06457.
If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel,
will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will
issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ms. L.M. Cuoco, Senior Nuclear Counsel, Northeast Utilities Service Company, Post Office
Box 270, Hartford, CT 06141-0270, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards consideration in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 7, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street,
Middletown, CT 06457.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of Omaha Public Power District (Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1); Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I



The Omaha Public Power District (OPPD/the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-40,
which authorizes operation of the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1 (the facility), at steady state reactor core power
levels not in excess of 1500 megawatts thermal. This facility is a pressurized water reactor located in Washington
County, Nebraska. The license provides, among other things, that Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1 is subject to all rules,
regulations, and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.



II



The proposed action would exempt the licensee from the filing time requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) regarding
the submission of the report of annual radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents released to unrestricted areas during
the previous calendar year. By letter dated May 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2)
to allow the licensee to change the date specified in the technical specifications for submitting this report from
March 1 to before May 1, starting in 1995. These reports are required by 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) to be submitted at intervals
no greater than 12 months. Because of the change, the interval between the 1994 and the 1995 reports will be greater
than 12 months.



III



The Commission has reviewed the licensee's rationale for a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) in order to
allow for the submittal date in the technical specifications (TS) to be changed to May 1.

Based on its review, the Commission finds the licensee has shown good cause for the requested exemption from 10 CFR
50.36a(a)(2). The proposed exemption is needed to allow the licensee to take advantage of the new date that the report
would be due, under the guidance of a draft generic letter regarding the new 10 CFR part 20. The previous TS 5.9.4.a was
based on the old requirement that the report be submitted within 60 days after January 1 of each year (March 1). Approval
of the new TS will require this one time exemption to change the date of submission from March 1 to any date prior to May
1. This exemption will not affect the information required to be submitted for the time period the report covers (the
previous calendar year's data); only the date the report is to be submitted would be changed. The special circumstances
required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present since the application of the submittal time requirement of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2)
to the Annual Radioactive Effluent Release Report is not required to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Therefore,
the request to extend the time requirement for submission of the annual report is acceptable.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the exemption is authorized by law, will
not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security; and
that special circumstances are present as set forth above. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption
from the time requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2).

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of the Exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 39579).

This Exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States</DOCTITLE>


September 22, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'' or the ``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').




APPLICANT: 

The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (``Equitable'').



RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Section 9(a).


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant seeks an order exempting itself and its affiliates, in their respective capacities as investment advisers,
principal underwriters and depositors, from the disqualification provisions of Section 9(a) with respect to Equitable's
separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts (``UITs'') that derive assets from the sale of variable annuity
contracts. The exemptions, subject to certain conditions, would apply to Equitable's (and its affiliates') officers,
directors and employees who do not participate directly in the management or administration of the separate accounts
or their underlying management investment companies, or in the sale of their variable annuity contracts.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Equitable is a New York Stock life insurance company that is authorized to sell life insurance and annuities in all
fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Equitable is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Equitable Companies Incorporated, (``Holding Company''), a publicly-traded holding company. AXA, a French
insurance holding company, is the largest stockholder of the Holding Company. Equitable is registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``1934 Act'') as a broker-dealer and under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
as an investment adviser. Equitable is the depositor of two separate accounts that fund variable annuity contracts
(the ``Separate Accounts'').
2. The Separate Accounts are organized as UITs and are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the 1940 Act.
The Separate Accounts fund benefits under certain group and individual variable annuity contracts. The assets of
the Separate Accounts are invested exclusively in shares of the Hudson River Trust, a registered open-end investment
company.
3. Equico Securities, Inc. (``Equico''), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Equitable, is the principal underwriter
of the Separate Accounts. Equico is also registered as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser.

<TEXT>
 

4. Alliance Capital Management L.P., an indirectly majority-owned subsidiary of Equitable, provides administrative
and advisory services to the Hudson River Trust.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 9(a) automatically disqualifies a company from serving as an adviser, depositor or principal underwriter
to a registered investment company if the company or an affiliate has an employee, officer or director who has been
convicted of a securities-related offense or enjoined by a court from serving in a securities-related position.
The purpose of Section 9(a) is to prevent persons of questionable character from occupying positions of influence
over registered investment companies.

2. Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) provide certain exemptions from the automatic disqualification provisions
of Section 9(a). Paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(15) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) restrict the applicability of
Section 9(a) to persons who participate directly in the management or administration of the separate account and
the underlying fund, or in the sale of the variable life contracts funded by the separate account.

3. There is no rule affording similar relief with respect to insurance company separate accounts funding variable
annuity contracts, such as the Separate Accounts.

4. Equitable has approximately 5,200 non-officer employees and 8,000 insurance agents who are registered representatives,
in addition to its officers and directors. Section 9(a) applies to Equitable, as depositor and principal underwriter
of the Separate Accounts, and to its affiliates, as investment advisers and principal underwriters of registered
investment companies.

5. Section 9(a) would automatically disqualify Equitable and its affiliates from serving as depositor, principal
underwriter or investment adviser if any one of their employees became disqualified under Section 9(a), even if the
employee worked in one of Equitable's businesses not regulated under the 1940 Act and did not participate in the management
or administration of the Separate Accounts or the Hudson River Trust, or in the sale of variable annuity contracts.

6. Equitable seeks an order limiting the automatic disqualification provisions of Section 9(a) with respect to the
Separate Accounts to the same basis available to separate accounts funding variable life insurance contracts by
Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T). Equitable asserts that the intended focus of Section 9(a) is on the operation of
investment companies and not on ancillary businesses unrelated to investment company operations and management.
Equitable states that its requested relief is consistent with the purpose of Section 9(a).

7. Equitable contends that the Commission already has recognized the appropriateness of limiting the disqualification
provisions of Section 9(a) with respect to variable annuity operations by granting applications permitting ``mixed
funding.''
 As a result, underlying management investment companies that will be used to fund both variable annuity contracts
and variable life insurance contracts have been required to file applications under Section 6(c). The Commission
has granted numerous such exemptive orders under delegated authority.

<DOCNO> FR940928-2-00142 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940928-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

8. Presently, whenever an officer, director or employee of Equitable is subject to the automatic disqualification
provisions of Section 9(a), Equitable must apply for a Commission order pursuant to Section 9(c) of the 1940 Act to
exempt the person and Equitable from the disqualification provisions of Section 9(a).



The circumstances under which the Commission has limited the disqualification provisions of Section 9(a) pursuant
to Section 9(c) have become standardized.
 These conditions include a requirement that, in cases where the disqualification arises solely because an applicant
employs a person who is disqualified under Section 9(a) (1) or (2), the disqualified employee will not be involved
in investment company or investment advisory activities. The requirement to submit such applications places an
undue burden on both Equitable and the Commission without any public benefit if the individual does not participate
in the operations or management of a registered investment company or in the sale of variable insurance contracts.










9. Equitable currently maintains monitoring procedures to identify any insurance agent subject to a statutory disqualification.
Similar monitoring procedures will remain in effect for officers, directors, and employees of Equitable who do not
function as insurance agents or registered representatives. These procedures include:



a. Insurance agents of Equitable are required to complete the disciplinary questions on Form U-4 (Uniform Application
for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer) before entering into a contract with Equitable; and




b. If the response to any question on page 3 of Form U-4 is affirmative, a copy of the response is sent to Equitable's
compliance department. Equitable then determines whether the insurance agent is subject to statutory disqualification
under Section 15(b) of the 1934 Act or Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act and whether to proceed with the hiring process.




Conditions for Relief





Equitable agrees that if the requested exemptions are granted, Equitable will maintain its current monitoring procedures
to identify officers, directors and employees subject to disqualification. Equitable will maintain a list of its
officers, directors and employees who participate directly in the management or administration of any variable
annuity separate account of Equitable and any registered investment company underlying Equitable's variable annuity
separate accounts. Equitable also will maintain a list of its agents who, as registered representatives of Equico,
offer and sell variable annuity contracts. These lists will be available to the staff of the Commission. The individuals
named on the lists will remain subject to the automatic disqualification provisions of Section 9(a).





Conclusion





Applicant submits that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from Section 9(a) of the 1940
Act meet the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicant asserts that the exemptions requested are
necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the policies
and provisions of the 1940 Act.





By the Commission.

basic fee rate, and (b) an income-based component. The basic fee rate is the sum of two parts: (a) a group fee rate based
on the monthly average net assets of all funds advised by Fidelity Management, and (b) an individual fund fee rate of
.03%. The group fee rate ranges from a maximum of .37% to a marginal rate of .1325% if total assets in all of the funds advised
by Fidelity Management rise. One-twelfth of the combined annual fee rate is applied to the VIP Money Market Portfolio's
net assets averaged over the most recent month, giving a dollar amount which is the fee for that month. If the VIP Money
Market Portfolio's gross yield is 5% or less, the basic fee is the total management fee. The income-based component
is added to the basic fee only when the VIP Money Market Portfolio's yield is greater than 5%. The income-based fee is
6% of that portion of the VIP Money Market Portfolio's yield that represents a gross yield of more than 5% per year. The
maximum income-based component is .24%.
9. Applicants propose to substitute shares of the VIP Money Market Portfolio for all outstanding shares of the J-P
Money Market Fund attributable to the Contracts (``Substitution'') as soon as practicable following the issuance
of the Commission's order. Applicants state that Jefferson-Pilot will supplement the prospectus for the Separate
Account to reflect the proposed Substitution.
10. At the close of business on the date of the Substitution, Jefferson-Pilot will redeem for cash all shares of the

J-P Money Market Fund it currently holds on behalf of the Separate Account. On the business day following the
Substitution, Jefferson-Pilot will redeem for cash all shares of the J-P Money Market Fund that it currently
owns, representing its ``seed money'' investment held directly in its General Account. The J-P Money Market
Fund will process a redemption request and, simultaneously, the VIP Money Market Portfolio will process a purchase
order for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds. The redemption request and the purchase order will be at prices
based on the current net assets values per share next computed after receipt thereof and, therefore, in a manner consistent
with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. Monies attributable to Contract owners currently invested in the J-P Money
Market Fund will be fully invested at all times. The full net asset value of and number of redeemed J-P Money Market
Fund shares held by the Separate Account will be reflected in the Contract owner's accumulation unit values following
the Substitution.
11. All expenses and transaction costs of the Substitution, including applicable brokerage commissions, will be
assumed by Jefferson-Pilot and reflected in the redemption proceeds.
12. Within five days after the Substitution, Contract owners will be sent a written notice of the Substitution (``Notice''),
the prospectus for the VIP Fund, and the supplement to the prospectus for the Separate Account describing the Substitution.
The Notice will advise Contract owners that for a period of thirty days from the mailing of the Notice (``Free Transfer
Period''), Contract owners may transfer all assets, as substituted, to any other available Subaccount, without
limitation and without charge. Following the Substitution, Contract owners will be afforded the same contract rights,
including surrender and other transfer rights, with regard to amounts they have currently invested under the Contracts.
There are no currently applicable surrender fees or redemption charges under the Contracts. Applicable deferred
sales charges, however, will be imposed.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary
to permit the substitution of shares of the VIP Money Market Portfolio for the shares of the 
J-P Money Market Fund held by Separate Account.
 Thereafter, the VIP Money Market Portfolio will serve as one of the eligible funding vehicles for the Contracts.

2. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust
holding the security of a single issuer ``* * * to substitute another security for such security unless
the Commission shall have approved such substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution
if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of this title.''
3. Applicants state that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution are consistent with the principals
and purposes of Section 26(b), do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(b) is designed to prevent, including
costly forced redemptions, and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the 1940 Act. Applicants further state that the Substitution has been determined by Jefferson-Pilot to be in the
best interests of Contract owners for the following reasons.
4. Applicants state that the objectives, policies and restrictions of the J-P Money Market Fund and the VIP Money
Market Portfolio are substantially similar_both are money market funds that seek to comply with Rule 2a-7 under
the 1940 Act. Further, given Rule 2a-7 requirements, the credit quality, maturity and diversification requirements
applicable to each Fund are identical.
5. Applicants state that, due to the J-P Money Market Fund's relatively insignificant total net assets ($21,116,119
at March 31, 1994), J-P Management has had greater difficulty making appropriate investments than it would
have had if that Fund had greater assets. Applicants submit that, due to the VIP Money Market Portfolio's larger asset
size, it is not expected to experience the type of difficulties experienced by the J-P Money Market Fund with
its smaller asset base in adhering to diversification requirements applicable to money market funds under Rule 2a-7.
Additionally, Fidelity Management, the VIP Money Market Portfolio's investment adviser, has specialized in the
management of mutual funds since 1946 and is a widely recognized expert in money management.
6. Applicants state that the expense ratio of the VIP Money Market Portfolio (.27%) is lower than that of the J-P
Money Market Fund (.65%), which has remained relatively high for this type of fund. Further, because a large portion
of the J-P Money Market Fund expenses is fixed and the size of the Fund is relatively small and unlikely to grow
significantly, these fixed expenses currently represent, and may continue to represent, a relatively large percentage
of the Fund's average daily net assets. In contrast, the expense ratio of the VIP Money Market Portfolio has remained
at or near the .27% level for many years and is likely to continue to be lower because of the Portfolio's larger asset
base. Consequently, Applicants assert that, following the Substitution, Contract owners will not be exposed to
higher expenses and should benefit from the VIP Money Market Portfolio's lower expense ratio. Additionally, lower
expense ratios generally indicate higher possible investment returns for Contract owners. For the seven days ended
May 31, 1994, the yield and effective yield were 3.338% and 3.43%, respectively, for the J-P Money Market Fund,
and 4.09% and 4.18%, respectively, for the VIP Money Market Portfolio.
7. Applicants states that the assets of the J-P Money Market Fund on March 31, 1994 were $21,116,119, and that
the Fund has not exceeded a $25 million asset level during the past ten years ended March 31, 1994, a level that the Fund
is not expected to exceed in the future. In comparison, the VIP Money Market Portfolio's assets at March 31, 1994 were
$572 million and are expected to increase. Further, while shares of the VIP Money Market Portfolio are offered to separate
accounts of insurance companies, whether or not affiliated with Fidelity Management, shares of the J-P Money
Market Fund are actively marketed only to Jefferson-Pilot. Applicants thus submit that the VIP Money Market Portfolio
is more likely to increase in size than the J-P Money Market Fund.
8. Applicant state that the Contracts reserve Jefferson-Pilot the right to replace shares of the J-P Money Market
Fund held by the Separate Account with shares of another registered investment company, such as the VIP Fund, if (i)
shares of the J-P Money Market Fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account, or (ii) in
Jefferson-Pilot's judgment, subject to Commission approval, further investment in the J-P Money Market Fund
should become inappropriate. Jefferson-Pilot represents that further investment in shares of the J-P Money
Market Fund is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
9. Contract owners will incur no transfer fees in connection with the Substitution. Applicants represent that the
Substitution will have no adverse federal income tax consequences for the Contract owners. Additionally, the Substitution
will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contract owners or the contractual obligations of Jefferson-Pilot.
Contract owners will continue to look to Jefferson-Pilot with regard to their rights under the Contracts.

10. Applicants consent to the following terms of and conditions to the issuance of an order granting an exemption under
Section 26(b):






(a) The Substitution is of shares of the J-P Money Market Fund, which is a money market fund whose objectives,
policies and restrictions and substantially similar to those of the VIP Money Market Portfolio so as to continue fulfilling
Contract owners' objectives and risk expectations;

(b) If a Contract owner requests, during the Free Transfer Period, asserts will be reallocated for investment in a
Contract owner selected Subaccount. The Free Transfer Period is sufficient time for Contract owners to reconsider
the Substitution;

(c) The Substitution will, in all cases, be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any
transfer or similar charges;

(d) Jefferson-Pilot will assume all expenses and transaction costs, including, among others, legal and accounting
fees and any brokerage commissions, relating to the Substitution in a manner that attributes all transaction costs
to Jefferson-Pilot;

(e) The Substitution in no way will alter the insurance benefits to the Contract owners, the contractual obligations
of Jefferson-Pilot;

(f) The Substitution in no way will alter the tax benefits to Contract owners;

(g) Contract owners may choose to withdraw amounts credited to them following the Substitution under conditions
that currently exist under the Contracts, subject to any applicable deferred sales charge; and

(h) The Substitution is expected to confer certain modest economic benefits to Contract owners by virtue of the enhanced
asset size of the VIP Money Market Portfolio.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested under Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act is necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies
and provisions of the 1940 Act. Accordingly the Applicants request that the Commission grant the necessary exemptions
and approvals pursuant to Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act permitting the Substitution.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee; General Aviation Maintenance Working Group



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of establishment of General Aviation Maintenance Working Group.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of the establishment of the General Aviation Maintenance Working Group of the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC on air carrier/general aviation
maintenance issues.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area the ARAC deals with is air carrier/general aviation
maintenance issues. These issues involve mechanic certification and approved training schools outlined in parts
65 and 147 and the maintenance standards for parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 aircraft, engines, propellers, and
their component parts and parallel provisions in parts 21, 43, 91, 121, 125, 127, 129, 133, 135, and 137 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Flight Standards Service.



Task



Specifically, the working group's task is the following:




Review Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, parts 43 and 91, and supporting policy and guidance material for the purpose
of determining the course of action to be taken for rulemaking and/or policy relative to the issue of general aviation
aircraft inspection and maintenance, specifically section 91.409, part 43, and Appendices A and D of part 43. In your
review, consider any inspection and maintenance initiatives underway throughout the aviation industry affecting
general aviation with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less. Also consider ongoing initiatives
in the areas of: maintenance recordkeeping; research and development; the age of the current aircraft fleet; harmonization;
the true cost of inspection versus maintenance; and changes in technology.

If deemed appropriate, draft for ARAC a notice of proposed rulemaking for the task proposing new or revised requirements,
a supporting economic analysis and other required analysis, advisory and guidance material, and any other collateral
documents the working group determines to be needed.



Reports



A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the
ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues held following publication of this notice.

B. Give a detailed conceptual presentation on the task to the ARAC before proceeding with the work stated under item
C below.

C. Give a status report on the task at each meeting of ARAC held to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues.

The General Aviation Maintenance Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest
in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the member organizations
of ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working group should
write the person listed under the caption 

for further information contact

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues and the Chair of the General Aviation Maintenance Working Group, and the individual will be advised whether
or not the request can be accommodated.

The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general
aviation maintenance issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act. Meetings of the General Aviation Maintenance Working Group will not be open to the public, except to
the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of
working group meetings will be made.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Clatsop County, Oregon</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Clatsop County, Oregon. The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) prepared and published
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in September 1993 and held a Public Hearing in October 1993. Originally,
this project was planned for Access Oregon Highway funding. Because of an unanticipated shortage of State funds,
ODOT is now requesting federal-aid participation in the proposed project. As a result, FHWA is reviewing the DEIS,
public hearing testimony and comments received on the DEIS to determine if all federal requirements have been met
to allow us to approve the DEIS for circulation in accordance with requirements in 23 CFR 771.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The FHWA is currently reviewing the DEIS, public hearing testimony and written comments. FHWA, in cooperation with
the ODOT, will prepare a Draft 4(f) evaluation which will accompany the DEIS. FHWA and ODOT will determine whether
a supplemental environmental document is necessary and prepare a Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project.



The proposed project would realign about a 9.66 kilometer (6 mile) segment of the Lower Columbia River Highway (US
30) from the John Day River Bridge, over new alignment through the Clatsop State Forest, to connect with the existing
Nehalem Highway (OR 202) at Williamsport Road, and then to join US 101 on the west side of Astoria near the north end of
the Youngs Bay bridge. The improvements would include an interchange at the existing Williamsport Road-Nehalem
Highway intersection, upgrading of the US 101/OR 202 intersection, improving access to the Port of Astoria, and widening
of the existing OR 202 and US 101 segments of the project.

The purpose of the proposed project is to provide an improved and safe route for traffic to and from the Port of Astoria,
to reduce the truck traffic, improve safety and overall congestion in downtown Astoria, and provide a second east-west
route in and out of Astoria. The No-Build and the one Build Alternative are under consideration.

The ODOT DEIS indicates that approximately 31.6 hectares (78 acres) of additional right-of-way would be required
for the project. This includes 23.1 ha (57 acres) of forest land, 3.2 ha (8 acres) of residential land, 2.8 ha (7 acres)
of undeveloped land, and 2.4 ha (6 acres) of various other uses. The project would displace an estimated 35-40
residences in which about 75-90 persons lived in late 1992. In addition, it would displace approximately 6 businesses
which employ about 25 workers. The project will affect and use right-of-way from four historic properties. It is estimated
that the project may impact about 6.5 ha (16 acres) of wetlands. Threatened and endangered species have been identified
in the project corridor as well as a great blue heron rookery and habitat used by Roosevelt elk and blacktail deer.

Information describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state,
and local agencies. Public meetings and a public hearing have been held on the proposed project. Additional public
meetings will be held if needed. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed
to the FHWA at the address provided above.
