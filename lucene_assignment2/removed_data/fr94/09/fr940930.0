Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 35 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02 R1, which
currently require several ruddervator checks and modifications on certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech)
35 series airplanes. This action maintains the requirements of each of the superseded AD's and requires rebalancing
the ruddervators (off the airplane) anytime the ruddervator is repaired or repainted (even if stripes are added).
The required action imposes no new speed restrictions. Several incidents where empennage flutter occurred on the
affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent structural failure
of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Several incidents involving 
certain Beech 35 series airplanes where empennage 
flutter occurred prompted the FAA to re-evaluate 
current airworthiness directives that relate to the 
same subject, and apply to the same airplane models. 
These AD's are: 



 AD 57-18-01, Amendment 39-1759, which currently 
requires repetitively inspecting the fuselage bulkhead 
for cracks, buckles, or distortion on certain Beech 35 
series airplanes, and also requires checking the 
ruddervator to ensure that the static balance is within 
acceptable limits. The inspections and checks are 
accomplished utilizing information in Beech Service 
Bulletin (SB) No. 35-26, dated May 20, 1953. The 
Bonanza Maintenance Manual 35-590073 also specifies 
information for the ruddervator checks; and 

 AD 87-20-02 R1, Amendment 39-5944, which 
currently requires the following on certain Beech 35 
series airplanes: (1) installing external stabilizer 
reinforcements; (2) inspecting the rear fuselage and 
bulkheads in the area of the empennage for cracks or 
distortion for those models equipped with an increased 
stabilizer chord length/overhang, and repairing or 
replacing any cracked or distorted parts; and (3) 
checking the ruddervator static balance to ensure that 
the static balance is within acceptable limits, and 
correcting if necessary.

After examining all available information related 
to the incidents above, the FAA published a proposal in 
the 

Federal Register

 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760) 
to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
(14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to 
certain Beech 35 series airplanes . The document 
proposed to supersede AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02 R1 
with a new AD that would maintain the requirements of 
each of the current AD's, and would require rebalancing 
the ruddervators (off the airplane) anytime the 
ruddervator is repaired or repainted (even if stripes 
are added). The document does not propose any new 
speed restrictions. 

Interested persons were afforded an opportunity to 
participate in the making of this amendment. Several 
comments were received on the proposed rule. These 
comments reference inadvertent mistakes made by the FAA 
in drafting the proposed rule and request additional 
time to comment on the proposed rule. 

In order to allow the public additional time to 
comment on the proposed rule, the FAA reissued this 
document as a supplemental NPRM that corrected the 
inadvertent mistakes, and published it in the 

Federal 
Register

 on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16151). 

Due consideration has been given to the two 
comments received on the supplemental NPRM. 

The Beech Aircraft Corporation states that 
reference to Beech Kit No. 35-4016-9 is referenced 
incorrectly as Beech Kit No. 39-4016-9 in paragraph 
(g)(3) of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has 
changed the AD accordingly. 

The other commenter recommends deleting Figure 2 
(Method No. 2) because of the expense and effort 
required to accomplish the tasks presented. The FAA 
concurs that Method No. 2 is expensive to accomplish 
and that the complete weighing procedure is 
accomplished more accurately using the other two 
methods. Method No. 2 of the AD has been deleted, thus 
changing the proposed Method No. 3 to Method No. 2. 

After careful review, including the comments noted 
above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the 
public interest require the adoption of the rule as 
proposed in the supplemental NPRM except for changes 
referenced above and minor editorial corrections. The 
FAA has determined that these minor changes and 
corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor 
add any additional burden upon the public than was 
already proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 10,200 airplanes in the 
U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will 
take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the required action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost 
approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. This figure 
is based on the assumption that no affected 
owner/operator has accomplished the required action, 
and does not reflect repetitive inspections. The FAA 
has no way of determining how many repetitive 
inspections a particular owner/operator may incur. 

In addition, AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02 R1, which 
both are superseded by this action, require the same 
actions as specified by this AD. With the idea that 
all affected owners/operators are in compliance with 
the superseded AD's referenced above, this AD does not 
impose any initial cost impact over what is already 
required by AD 57-18-01 and AD 87-20-02 R1. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) 
will not have a significant economic impact, positive 
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action 
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location 
provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 
1900 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that applies to certain Beech Aircraft 
Corporation (Beech) 1900 series airplanes. This action 
requires inspecting the hot battery bus fuse assembly 
for proper wiring, correcting the wiring if incorrect, 
and modifying the wiring to add a redundant power 
source for the hot battery bus. This action results 
from a report of the hot battery bus bar wrongly 
installed on the lower (load) side of the hot battery 
bus fuse assembly on one of the affected airplanes. 
Correct installation is the upper (power) side of the 
circuit. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
to protect from overloads to either circuit connected 
to the hot battery bus from overloads, which, if not 
protected, could result in loss of certain emergency 
equipment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FAA has received a 
report that the hot battery bus bar was wrongly 
installed on the lower (load) side of the hot battery 
bus fuse assembly on a Beech 1900 series airplane. 
Correct installation is the upper (power) side of the 
circuit. With the reported configuration, a single 
five amp fuse supplies electrical power to all the 
systems connected to the bus instead of (under the 
correct wiring configuration) the hot battery bus 
supplying each essential load independently through a 
fuse for each load. In normal conditions, an airplane 
operator would not notice the miswired hot battery bus 
bar until the single fuse is blown. This condition, if 
not detected and corrected, could result in the loss of 
electrical power to all emergency equipment connected 
to the hot battery bus. This equipment includes the 
left and 
right engine fire extinguisher bottles, the left and 
right fire wall shutoff valves, the cockpit emergency 
lighting, and the engine fire extinguisher indicator 
lights. 



In addition, these airplanes currently are not 
equipped with a redundant power source for the 
emergency equipment receiving power from the hot 
battery bus. Under the present scenario, an internal 
battery problem could prevent the use of the emergency 
equipment because of no backup power sources for this 
equipment connected to the hot battery bus. 

Beech has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2562, 
dated August 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) 
inspecting the hot battery bus fuse assembly for proper 
wiring and correcting the wiring if incorrect, and (2) 
modifying the wiring to add a redundant power source 
for the hot battery bus. 

After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action 
should be taken in order to protect either circuit 
connected to the hot battery bus from overloads, which, 
if not protected, could result in loss of certain 
emergency equipment. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 1900 
series airplanes of the same type design, this AD 
requires the inspection and modification specified in 
Beech SB No. 2562, dated August 1994. 

Since a situation exists that requires the 
immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that 
notice and opportunity for public prior comment hereon 
are impracticable, and that good cause exists for 
making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final 
rule that involves requirements affecting immediate 
flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and 
opportunity to comment, comments are invited on this 
rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on 
this rule by submitting such written data, views, or 
arguments as they may desire. Communications should 
identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in 
triplicate to the address specified above. All 
communications received on or before the closing date 
for comments will be considered, and this rule may be 
amended in light of the comments received. Factual 
information that supports the commenter's ideas and 
suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the 
effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether 
additional rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall 
regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects 
of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the 
rule. All comments submitted will be available, both 
before and after the closing date for comments, in the 
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A 
report that summarizes each FAA-public contact 
concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed 
in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt 
of their comments submitted in response to this notice 
must submit a 
self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following 
statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-19-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and
returned to 
the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an 
emergency regulation and that must be issued 
immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, 
and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under 
Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further 
that this action involves an emergency regulation under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, 
February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant 
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in 
the Rules Docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not 
required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained 
from the Rules Docket.

Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT9D Series Turbofan Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT9D series
turbofan engines, that currently requires eddy current inspection and modification of the diffuser case rear rail,
and removal, if necessary, of the diffuser case. This amendment corrects an error in paragraph numbering in the compliance
section and allows modification of diffuser cases in accordance with previous revisions of a PW Service Bulletin
as an alternative means of compliance. This amendment is prompted by comments received after issuance of AD 93-19-02.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent diffuser case rupture and an uncontained engine failure.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 16, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued AD 93-19-02, Amendment 39-8695
(58 FR 51212, October 1, 1993), as a final rule with request for comments that superseded AD 86-11-04, to
define initial inspection requirements that will allow for transition to more stringent repetitive on-wing eddy
current inspections of the diffuser case rear rail for cracking. AD 93-19-02 also requires ultrasonic
and metallographic inspections of the shell wall, and ultrasonic inspection of the rear rail at the Boss 6 location
to determine weld size. In the previous AD, 86-11-04, diffuser cases were allowed to remain in service
with weld repairs of up to 4 inches in length. In AD 93-19-02, diffuser cases with weld repairs in the rear
rail of greater than or equal to 1.5 inches in axial length at Boss 6 must be replaced. In addition, AD 93-19-02
requires a one-time X-ray inspection of the rear rail and sides of bosses for weld quality. This inspection is necessary
since in the last two failures, weld defects were undetected by the inspections required by AD 86-11-04.
Also, diffuser cases with rear rails that have been weld-repaired must incorporate the modifications described
in PW SB No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993. Finally, an optional terminating action to the inspections
and modifications of AD 93-19-02 is available with the installation of a new, improved diffuser case in
accordance with PW SB No. 6105, Revision 2, dated May 14, 1993.

AD 93-19-02 was prompted by reports of 2 additional diffuser case failures. Both failures occurred within
significantly shorter time intervals since last inspection than that specified in AD 86-11-04. In an
effort to better understand the diffuser case failure mode, a rig test was performed. This test examined crack initiation
and growth rates in weld-repaired versus non-weld-repaired diffuser cases. Results of the test established that
cracks initiate and propagate more rapidly in weld-repaired diffuser cases. In addition, weld repairs at the Boss
6 location were determined to have even greater potential for rapid crack growth and resultant diffuser case failure.
That condition, if not corrected, could result in diffuser case rupture and an uncontained engine failure. 
Although AD 93-19-02 was issued as a final rule without prior notice and an opportunity for public comment,
the FAA requested comment on the AD. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
One commenter states that paragraph (c)(3) of AD 93-19-02 refers incorrectly to paragraphs (d) and (f),
as those paragraphs are applicable to those diffuser cases that have been weld-repaired. The FAA concurs. Paragraph
(c)(3) of this Revision to AD 93-19-02 has been changed to refer to paragraphs (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k),
and (l). These paragraphs are applicable to those diffuser cases that have not been weld-repaired. 
One commenter states that paragraph (o) of AD 93-19-02 requires modifications to the diffuser case in
accordance with PW Service Bulletin (SB) No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993. The commenter maintains
that modifications performed in accordance with the earlier revisions to this SB should be considered in compliance
with this AD. The FAA concurs. All previous revisions of PW SB No. 5805 differ from Revision 6 only in editorial clarifications
or corrections of typographical errors and do not impact the intent of the document. Modifications performed to the
diffuser case in accordance with the previous revisions of PW SB No. 5805 constitute an acceptable alternate means
of compliance to paragraph (o) of this AD. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the revision of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW SB No. 5805, Revision 6, dated September 15, 1993, that
describes procedures for modification of the rear rail by detaching the diffuser case rear rail from the strut boss,
thus extending the serviceable life of the diffuser case by reducing crack initiation and propagation rates; PW Alert
Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6076, Revision 1, dated August 20, 1992, that describes ultrasonic and metallographic
inspection of the shell wall, and ultrasonic inspection of the rear rail at the Boss 6 location to determine weld size;
PW SB No. 6088, dated August 5, 1992, that describes an X-ray inspection of the rear rail and sides of bosses for detection
of poor weld quality; PW SB No. 5591, Revision 7, dated August 25, 1992, that describe initial and repetitive on-wing
eddy current inspections of the diffuser case rear rail; and PW SB No. 6105, Revision 2, dated May 14, 1993, that describes
installation of a new, improved diffuser case. 
Additional information regarding weld repair requirements for the diffuser case rear rail is contained in PW JT9D
Engine Manual, Part Number 686028, dated September 1, 1993.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other PW JT9D series turbofan engines
of this same type design, this AD revises AD 93-19-02 to correct an error in paragraph numbering in the compliance
section and allow modification of diffuser cases in accordance with previous revisions of PW SB No. 5805 as an alternative
means of compliance to paragraph (o) of this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletins described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 92-ANE-33.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Amendments to the On-Time Disclosure Rule


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration, Department of Transportation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule revises the on-time flight performance reporting requirements by: Eliminating the exclusion of flights
delayed or canceled due to mechanical problems; adding the aircraft tail number, and wheels-off and wheels-on times
for each flight reported; adding several definitions; clarifying the reporting requirements for a new flight; and
deleting references to obsolete organizational offices.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On December 4, 1992, the Research and Special Programs Administration (``RSPA'') issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(``NPRM'') (57 FR 58755; December 11, 1992) seeking public comments on the proposal to improve the on-time flight
performance reporting requirements in 14 CFR Part 234 

Airline Service Quality Performance Reports. 

The Department proposed to eliminate the reporting exclusion for flights delayed or canceled due to mechanical problems;
to add the aircraft tail number, and wheels-off and wheels-on time for each flight reported; to define ``canceled
flight,'' ``discontinued flight,'' ``diverted flight,'' and ``extra-section flight''; to clarify the reporting
requirement for a new flight; and, to delete references to obsolete offices.
Part 234 requires the largest U.S. air carriers to report their on-time departure and arrival performances for every
domestic scheduled-passenger flight operated to or from a reportable airport, with the exception of flights that
are delayed 15 minutes or more, or canceled, because of mechanical problems. A flight is considered on-time if the
flight departs and arrives less than 15 minutes after its published scheduled times. The Department publishes separate
listings for departure and arrival performances. The reporting system developed for the administration of these
reporting requirements is called the On-Time Flight Performance System.

The U.S. carriers covered by the Part 234 requirements are those generating at least 1 percent of the U.S. domestic
scheduled-passenger revenues on a yearly basis. Currently, there are ten carriers reporting the data. They are Alaska
Airlines, Inc. (Alaska), America West Airlines, Inc. (America West), American Airlines, Inc. (American), Continental
Air Lines, Inc. (Continental), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta), Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest), Southwest
Airlines Co. (Southwest), Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), United Air Lines, Inc. (United) and USAir, Inc. (USAir).
Reportable airports are those airports in the contiguous 48 states generating at least 1 percent of the domestic scheduled-passenger
enplanements on an annual basis. There are 29 reportable airports in 1994. In practice, all reporting carriers are
voluntarily submitting data for their entire domestic scheduled-passenger operations.
One of the main purposes of the rule is to create a market-based incentive for airlines to improve their service quality
and schedule reliability for consumers. The public availability of comparative data on airline service quality
creates this market-based carrier incentive.
The addition of wheels-off and wheels-on times, and the identification of aircraft by tail number, will enable the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to analyze air traffic operations and create system models for use in reducing
enroute and ramp delays. Air traffic delays cost the public and the industry an estimated $8.5 billion in 1990, according
to the FAA.


Public Comments


Comments on the NPRM were received from Alaska, American, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, the Air Transport Association
of America (ATA), The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), and America West which filed comments
along with a motion for leave to file late comments.
The ATA is an airline trade association with 17 U.S. carrier members and two Canadian air carrier associate members.
Of the ten carriers currently reporting on-time flight performance data, America West is the only non-ATA member.
The ATA stated that Alaska, Northwest and Southwest did not join in ATA's comments to the NPRM.
The comments address safety, alternative data sources, the proprietary nature of aircraft tail number data, elimination
of the rule in its entirety, the addition of new data items and definition changes. Each of these subjects is addressed
under a separate caption.


Safety


Northwest, Southwest and America West opposed the elimination of the mechanical exclusion.
Northwest believes the existing rule balances the need for consumer information with safety, and gives carriers
an incentive to engage in realistic scheduling. Northwest states it has placed a high priority on improving its on-time
performance, and has developed a comprehensive system which includes employee training to assure flights are dispatched
on time. However, Northwest also states that it has, and always will place safety ahead of on-time flight performance.
Consequently, it has instructed its employees to ignore on-time flight performance when safety is an issue. Northwest
believes the proposed change will make on-time flight performance an issue that employees may wrongly consider when
making decisions that have major safety implications. Northwest states it does not want its employees to feel pressure
to choose between safety and on-time flight performance. Northwest believes the current rule is an unqualified success,
and should not be amended to include mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations.
Southwest believes the policy of each air carrier is ``safety first.'' However, Southwest feels a carrier cannot
guarantee that an employee's commitment to safety will not be affected by a desire to see the carrier do well in its on-time
flight performance. Southwest contends including mechanical delays in the reported flight records will intensify
the conflict between safety and on-time performance.
Southwest states the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) did not reveal any need for the proposed
change in the treatment of mechanical delays, other than the Inspector General's (IG) audit report which found minor
discrepancies in some nonreported flights. After the IG audit, RSPA issued an accounting and reporting directive
on the subject of nonreported mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations. Southwest asserts a follow-up audit
has not been conducted, and concludes that there is no evidence that the problem continues to exist.

Southwest further states that in a 1990 internal DOT memorandum, RSPA expressed concern with the IG's suggestion
that mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations should be collected with a suppression code to enable DOT to
continue excluding those flights from the monthly consumer report. RSPA commented that collecting data on mechanical
delays and mechanical cancellations would duplicate FAA's collection and would be counter to DOT's current policy.
RSPA also questioned whether the data on mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations could be protected under
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA).
In response to Southwest's contention that the NPRM did not reveal any need for eliminating the mechanical exclusion,
other than the IG's recommendation, RSPA notes that the NPRM specifically stated, ``The improved modifications
in the reporting system would result in improved consumer information . . .'' (57 FR 58756).
As asserted by Southwest, the Department did not conduct a follow-up audit on the exclusion of flights impacted by
mechanical problems. Southwest, therefore, concludes there is no evidence as to carrier reporting compliance after
RSPA issued its accounting and reporting directive to clarify the reporting instructions. However, the Department's
decision to propose eliminating the mechanical exclusion rendered a follow-up unnecessary.
Southwest also states that RSPA even had concerns about collecting data on mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations,
as the collection would duplicate an existing FAA collection and be counter to Departmental policy. While RSPA did
express concerns about the suggestion to collect mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations and suppress that
information in the data base, RSPA's concerns were with its ability to withhold the mechanical data from public release.
RSPA believed it would be required to release the mechanical data under the FOIA even if a suppression code were used.
Also, RSPA questioned whether the reporting of specific mechanical data to RSPA and the FAA was duplicate reporting,
which would be counter to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). This concern has been addressed because
carriers would not, under this rule, report specific mechanical data to the Department. All flights would be reported,
with no distinction between flights impacted by mechanical delays and those flights impacted by other delays.
America West requests the present exclusions for mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations be retained. The
carrier believes DOT would be ill-advised to make any changes in the existing regulations, unless DOT can assure the
change will not cause ``one employee at one airline on one occasion to send out an aircraft in order to avoid having a
`late' flight and that an incident or accident occurs.''

The Department does not believe reporting mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations would cause an employee
to compromise safety to improve an airline's on-time performance. Under the present system, an employee could easily
improve its employer's on-time performance by miscategorizing a delayed flight as a mechanical delay. The IG's report
did not find a pattern of this type of behavior at any of the reporting carriers. Rather, some flights were reported
as delayed flights that should have been excluded as mechanical delays, while other flights that were called mechanical
delays were actually delayed for other reasons. In no case was a carrier's monthly on-time performance ranking affected
by misclassification of flights. Given the fact employees did not attempt to improve on-time performance by intentionally
misclassifying flights, the Department does not believe employees will violate FAA regulations, risk their own
jobs, and threaten passenger safety by dispatching unairworthy aircraft to improve on-time performance. 
Moreover, the Department believes the elimination of the exclusion for mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations
will provide better consumer information since aircraft dispatch reliability will now be a factor in a carrier's
on-time performance. For example, two carriers each ground one of their aircraft for a day because of mechanical problems.
Carrier A fulfills its schedule using a backup aircraft. All of Carrier A's flights are on-time except for the last
flight operated with the backup aircraft. Carrier B does not have a backup aircraft available, so it cancels eight
flights that were to be operated with the disabled aircraft. Carrier B fulfills the rest of its schedule in a timely
manner. Under the mechanical exclusion provision, Carrier B would have the better on-time flight performance for
that day even though it was without a backup aircraft and cancelled eight flights. 
The present system, in some circumstances, penalizes the carrier with the more reliable service. Elimination of
the mechanical exclusion would end this inequity. If the previous example were based on the new rule, the carrier meeting
its schedule with backup equipment would have the better on-time rating. The availability of this additional information
would result in a more accurate portrayal of a carrier's flight operation, thereby enabling the consumer to make a
more informed flight-selection decision. Furthermore, the elimination of the exclusion should benefit the on-time
rankings of carriers with more effective preventive maintenance programs because such carriers would experience
fewer mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations. 
The Department intends for the airlines to continue to put safety first, and to train their employees accordingly.
As Northwest stated, it too always places safety ahead of on-time performance and instructs its employees to do the
same when there is a conflict between timeliness and safety. The Department is confident all carriers operate in the
same manner as Northwest. The change in the reporting requirements in 14 CFR Part 234 does not affect the requirement
under 14 CFR   121.703 and 121.705 that carriers report equipment malfunctions to the FAA. It is important
to remember the Department is not establishing a required level of performance that each carrier must meet. Rather,
the Department merely discloses to the public the carriers' on-time performance by month. The public will be better
informed when each carrier reports its complete schedule. 
ATA, American and Delta filed in support of the proposed amendment. They contend the elimination of the exclusion
would not compromise safety. 

ATA does not believe the elimination of the exclusion will adversely affect reporting air carriers or the travelling
public. The inclusion of mechanical-delay and mechanical-cancellation information will give those interested
in air carrier flight performance a better picture of flight delay and cancellation activity. The safety of passengers
and crew is the most important responsibility of air carriers. ATA states that carriers devote enormous resources
and attention to fulfilling that responsibility. ATA does not believe the elimination of the mechanical-delay and
mechanical-cancellation exclusion will induce ATA members to dispatch aircraft that are unairworthy, or have any
other adverse effect upon aviation safety. 
American believes that carriers would not risk safety for competitive reasons. Reporting all flights would ``provide
consumers with a more accurate picture of a carrier's overall on-time record, which is the reason for the rule in the
first place.'' 
Delta states that it has incurred considerable unnecessary expense to exclude the mechanical delays and mechanical
cancellations, and argues that their inclusion will not have a negative effect on the safety of airline operations.
Moreover, the existing rule ``has the effect of punishing carriers with better dispatch reliability records relative
to their competitors.''

The Port Authority also believes safety would not be compromised by the inclusion of maintenance-related delays;
and, the proposed changes would provide consumers with more useful information to make informed decisions. 


Alternative Data Sources_Wheels-Off/On Times 


While not objecting to the reporting of wheels-off and wheels-on data, ATA does not believe airlines should be required
to submit data that the agency itself could compile. 
Delta believes the wheels-off, wheels-on and tail number data could provide the FAA with valuable information for
improving the air traffic control system. However, Delta also believes carriers are already providing much of this
information to the FAA, and questions whether reporting the same data in a different format is cost justified. 
The Port Authority believes the additional data items will significantly benefit the study and reduction of air traffic
delays. By measuring wheels-off/on times against gate departure/arrival times, an airport operator can better
assess the efficiency of its airfield layout and take action to improve traffic flow and reduce ground delays, which
the authority estimates account for 70 percent of the total aircraft delay time at its airports. 
Alaska believes carrier submission of wheels-off and wheels-on time data is unnecessary and unjustified. The proposed
elements should be based on DOT's on-time flight performance needs rather than on FAA's air traffic control needs.

By collecting wheels-off and wheels-on times and tail numbers, the FAA will be able to use the on-time flight performance
data base to track flight delays. It is cost efficient to add these data items to an existing data base rather than to
create a new one. 
The Department agrees with Alaska that wheels-off and wheels-on times are not needed for consumer information purposes,
although consumers would benefit directly from reduced aircraft delays.
There is an existing company that is a potential data source for aircraft tail numbers, and wheels-off and wheels-on
times. Through its tracking system, the company captures these data elements for all scheduled domestic flights
for six of the ten reporting air carriers. 
The Department would accept carrier data through any outside company, if the proper arrangements can be made for data
transmittal. A carrier must give its permission to the outside company to provide the data to the government without
cost to the government. 


Proprietary Data_Aircraft Tail Number 


The collection of tail number data will benefit the FAA directly, by giving the FAA the necessary information to track
aircraft throughout the air traffic system. This tracking will enable the FAA to reduce aircraft delays, thereby
benefiting the consumer. 
ATA opposes collecting aircraft tail number information because it believes: (1) The information is proprietary
and very sensitive; (2) there is an appreciable cost burden to the carrier, especially to one carrier that tracks its
aircraft by nose numbers rather than tail numbers; and (3) consumers would not derive any benefits from the reporting
of tail numbers. 
ATA believes that the availability of tail-number data would enable a person to determine the way a carrier deploys
its aircraft throughout its route system. Thus, the reporting would reveal basic management decisionmaking. ATA
argues that such fundamental business decisions should not be required to be disclosed in monthly reports to the government.

The claim that data are proprietary in nature does not preclude the Department from collecting the data. FOIA provides
safeguards from the public disclosure of proprietary information. Moreover, the Department has no plans for routine
public release of tail-number data. A carrier objecting to public disclosure of tail-number data may file a motion
under the Department's regulation 14 CFR  302.39 

Objections to public disclosure of information.

 Such a motion would be reviewed under the requirements of FOIA.

The adoption of the tail number requirement would not result in an ``appreciable'' cost to the carriers, since most
of them already track their aircraft movements by tail number. While ATA states one of its member carriers tracks its
aircraft by nose number instead of tail number, no individual carrier has stated it would have difficulty in supplying
data by tail number. A carrier could easily program a bridge for converting its nose number to a tail number for Part
234 reporting purposes. If this is not feasible, the carrier may contact the Office of Airline Statistics (OAS) to
make other arrangements for tracking aircraft through the carrier's system. Any air carrier may request a waiver
under 14 CFR  234.12 from the on-time flight performance reporting provisions. 


Eliminate On-Time Flight Performance Reporting 


Alaska stated the Department should initiate a rulemaking to see whether the existing on-time performance requirements
should be eliminated, rather than imposing additional reporting requirements. Alaska believes the airline industry's
condition is far too dire to permit the continuation of a reporting regulation which Alaska argues has no appreciable
influence on consumer choice or industry scheduling conduct. Alaska does not adjust its schedules based on on-time
performance ratings. Its scheduling practices are tied to its internal schedule monitoring system that uses departure
times, in contrast to the Department's arrival-based reporting requirement.
Alaska believes that collection of additional data_mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations, wheels-off
and wheels-on times, and aircraft tail numbers_is unnecessary and unjustified until the current reporting requirements
are shown to have improved carrier scheduling conduct. 
The Department disagrees with Alaska's position that carrier on-time performance is unaffected by the reporting
requirements. In its answer to this rulemaking, Northwest stated it has made changes to its schedule to improve on-time
performance. On May 17, 1993, Delta implemented a system-wide communication program to improve its on-time performance.
Given the industry's improvement in on-time flight performance since the reporting requirement was instituted
in 1987, the Department believes most carriers have made similar changes. Before the reporting regulations were
in effect, a Department investigation into scheduling practices of selected air carriers at four major airports
disclosed that 25 to 60 percent of those carriers' scheduled flights were more than 15 minutes late (52 FR 34056; September
9, 1987). Today, more than 80 percent of the reporting carriers' flights are on time. On-time flight disclosure helps
to eliminate deceptive scheduling practices by carriers, to the benefit of consumers. 
Alaska believes departure times, rather than arrival times, are a better indicator of a carrier's reliability. The
Department disagrees. Consumers are more interested in arrival times, because they have meetings to attend or may
have somebody meeting them at the destination airport. Consumers also consider elapsed flight time when selecting
an air carrier. If arrival times were ignored, schedule times could be shaved to make them more appealing to consumers.
If the flights departed on time, the carrier would have a 100 percent on-time record even if every flight arrived a half-hour
late. Such information would be very deceptive to the consumer. 


New Data 


American suggested the Department collect aircraft-type data along with the other proposed data elements, as a means
of increasing the utility of the data. 
The Department agrees with American that aircraft-type data are useful for tracking the number of passengers affected
by aircraft delays. However, the Department can convert tail-number information into aircraft-type data using
the aircraft inventory data base maintained from the carriers' Schedule B-43 

Inventory of Airframes and Aircraft Engines

 and B-7 

Airframe and Aircraft Engine Acquisitions and Retirements.

 These schedules provide aircraft type by tail number. Thus, DOT does not need air carriers to supply aircraft-type
information with its Part 234 submission.

Definitions 


Delta suggested minor changes or clarifications to some of the definitions in the proposed rule. Delta recommended
RSPA clarify whether days mean calendar days or twenty-four hour periods. Delta also recommended RSPA revise ``diverted
flight'' to read: ``A diverted flight means a flight which is not operated from the originating point(s) to each of
the destinations set forth in the carrier's published schedule.'' 
The Department agrees with Delta's comments concerning the definitions, and has amended the definitions in the final
rule to show ``days'' mean calendar days; and ``diverted flight'' means a flight operated from the scheduled origin
point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in accordance with the carrier's published schedule.
Also, since the ensuing flight segment from the nonscheduled destination airport is not a scheduled departure, that
flight segment is not reported under Part 234. 


Technical Directive 


A Technical Directive was issued with the original rule in 1987 (Appendix I-Reporting Directive-Office of Aviation
Information Management, RSPA, 52 FR 34073, September 9, 1987), which instructed carriers on the proper reporting
format. Since then, the Technical Directive has been updated by other accounting and reporting directives, which
were issued by OAS. RSPA will reissue the Technical Directive to the industry concurrently with the publication of
this rule in the 

Federal Register

. The reissued Technical Directive includes the changes made in this rulemaking and other effective revisions made
in previous Accounting and Reporting Directives. The major revision in the Technical Directive is in the ADP area.



Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This final rule is considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore,
was subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. 
This rule is considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation
(44 FR 11034). The purpose of the rule is to improve consumer information on carrier on-time flight performance while,
at the same time, reducing carrier costs for providing such information and providing the FAA with the necessary data
to reduce flight delays. These objectives will be achieved by amending 14 CFR Part 234. The savings would be derived
from the decrease in air traffic delays, resulting from FAA's more efficient management of air traffic. The FAA estimated
a mere 1 percent reduction in delays would produce a cost savings of $85 million to the public and industry. According
to a study conducted by FAA's Information Systems Branch, the total cost of air traffic delays for calendar year 1990
was $8.5 billion. More recently, on May 27, 1993, in testimony before the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive
Airline Industry, Mr. Joseph M. Del Balzo, the FAA's Acting Administrator, stated the ATA estimates that air traffic
delays impose annual costs of $8 billion on the nation's airlines and air travelers.

The industry-wide cost for adding the three data items at issue would be a one-time programming and testing cost of
approximately $34,000, ten carriers at $3,400 per carrier. Once the programming is in place, the annual cost to the
carriers would be approximately $1,000 per carrier. The economic benefits to the industry, as well as to the consumer,
far outweigh the cost of supplying the data. Eliminating the exclusion of flights that are delayed by mechanical problems
in the carriers' on-time performance reports should result in a net savings to the air carriers. Delta stated that
the mechanical exclusion has caused it to incur unnecessary expenses. While the elimination of the mechanical exclusion
will require carriers to report more data to DOT, the carriers will not be required to identify the cause of the delays
and to filter out those flights delayed by mechanical problems. The end result will be better consumer information
and a cost savings to the reporting air carriers. The NPRM estimated the elimination of the mechanical exclusion should
save the airline industry at least $154,000. Although the Department encouraged carriers to comment on this estimate,
Delta was the only carrier that did; however, Delta did not quantify costs. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared
and placed in the rulemaking docket. In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department estimated there was a potential
annual savings to the airline industry and to the general public of $85 million. 

This rule is consistent with the objectives of the executive order because the rule creates market based incentives
for carriers to improve their on-time flight performance by providing consumers with superior information with
which to make informed choices. 

The amendments to 14 CFR Part 234 enable the Department to readily verify that the carriers are in compliance with the
reporting requirements. The Department will be able to match a carrier's reported flights with the carrier's scheduled
flights as listed in the 

Official Airline Guide

. Previously, such a matching was not possible, because carriers did not report qualifying mechanical delays and
mechanical cancellations. 

Title 14 CFR Part 234 does not specify an on-time flight performance standard which carriers must meet. Rather, the
carriers' reports provide consumers with information on carrier performance, which the consumer may use in carrier
selection. 

On-time flight performance data are pertinent information for state or local airport operators. The Port Authority
filed in support of the amendments to 14 CFR 234. 

The amendments to 14 CFR Part 234 simplify carrier reporting by eliminating the special, and sometimes complicated,
treatment of flights affected by mechanical delays. 

The three new data items were added at the request of the FAA, who will now be able to use the existing data base as a more
complete source of information for airport and enroute delay studies. This action negates the need for the FAA to create
a data base of its own.

This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
(``Federalism'') and DOT has determined the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
amendments will affect only large certificated U.S. air carriers accounting for at least 1 percent of U.S. domestic
scheduled passenger revenues (over $450 million annually for the 12 months ended March 31, 1993). The Department's
economic regulations define ``large certificated air carrier'' to include U.S. air carriers holding a certificate
issued under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, that operate aircraft designed to have a maximum
passenger capacity of more than 60 seats or a maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds. Consequently, small
carriers are not affected by this final rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with this rule were sent at the NPRM stage to the Office of
Management and Budget in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 under OMB NO: 2138-0041. The final rule adopts
those requirements. OMB has approved 14 CFR Part 234 through July 31, 1995. ADMINISTRATION: Research and Special

PART 234_AIRLINE SERVICE QUALITY PERFORMANCE REPORTS_[AMENDED] 



1. The authority for Part 234 is revised to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 40101, 40114, 41702, 41708 and 41712; 5 U.S.C. 553(e) and 14 CFR 302.38.




2. Section 234.2 Definitions is amended by revising the definitions of 

reportable flight

 and 

reporting carrier

; removing the definitions of 

mechanical delay

 and 

mechanical cancellation

; and adding new definitions in alphabetical order as follows: 



 234.2 

Definitions. 



For the purpose of this part: 

Cancelled flight

 means a flight operation that was not operated, but was listed in a carrier's computer reservation system within seven
calendar days of the scheduled departure. 



Discontinued flight 

means a flight dropped from a carrier's computer reservation system more than seven calendar days before its scheduled
departure. 



Diverted Flight 

means a flight which is operated from the scheduled origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point
in the carrier's published schedule. For example, a carrier has a published schedule for a flight from A to B to C. If
the carrier were to actually fly an A to C operation, the A to B segment is a diverted flight, and the B to C segment is a cancelled

Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR); Revisions to the CCL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending 
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising certain 
entries of the Commerce Control List (CCL) to conform with 
changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Equipment 
and Technology Annex. The MTCR is a multilateral forum; 
participating countries agree to control items contained on the 
Annex in order to limit proliferation of missiles capable of 
delivering weapons of mass destruction. Most of these revisions 
are based on technical consultations with MCTR countries held in 
September 1993, in London, and in December 1993, in Interlaken. 
Additionally, this rule makes other corrections and 
clarifications needed to make the CCL conform to the Annex. The 
revisions to the CCL made by this rule help to ensure that the 
items controlled by the United States in meeting its MTCR 
obligations are similar to those controlled by other MTCR 
participating countries. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


This rule amends Part 778 to clarify missile technology licensing 
policy. Many of the changes to the Commerce Control List (CCL) 
made by this rule, directly reflecting changes in the MTCR Annex, 
consist of technical refinements that more precisely identify 
items controlled for missile technology reasons. The technical 
refinements in Category 1 either change certain paragraphs or add 
clarifying notes. 
In other cases, the CCL has been brought into line where it had 
diverged from the Annex. In Category 3, 3A01.a.1.a replaces 
3A01.a.1, and resulting changes occur in 3D21 and 3E01. As 
telemetering and telecontrol equipment (5A20) are the only items 
in Category 5 on the Annex, the missile technology designation 
was removed from the ``Reason for Control'' paragraph of any other 
Category 5 entries. The GLV value limit for 5A20 is now $0. 
Since 7A27 now specifically controls 

airborne

 passive sensors, 
the GLV limit for that entry becomes $0. ``Specially designed 
components'' have been added to some entries to conform to the 
Annex. Finally, typographical errors in the definitions 
supplement have been corrected. 
Although the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) expired on 
August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act and determined that, to the extent 
permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA, as amended, shall be 
carried out under Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, so as 
to continue in full force and effect and amend, as necessary, the 
export control system heretofore maintained by the Export 
Administration Regulations issued under the EAA.

Saving Clause 


Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as 
a result of this regulatory action that were on dock for loading, 
on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard 
a carrier to a port of export pursuant to actual orders for 
export before September 30, 1994 may be exported under the 
previous general license provisions up to and including October 28, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before
midnight October 28, 1994, require a 
validated export license in accordance with this regulation. 



Rulemaking Requirements 


1. This final rule has been determined to be not 
significant for purposes of E. O. 12866. 
2. This rule involves collections of information subject 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 
These collections have been approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005, 0694-0007, 0694-0010 
and 0694-0023. 
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism 
implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism 
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an 
opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for 
this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 
U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no 
initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or 
will be prepared. 

 
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the 
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective 
date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a 
military and foreign affairs function of the United States. 
Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed 
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for 
this rule. 
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although 
there is no formal comment period, public comments on this 
regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments 
should be submitted to Hillary Hess, Office of Technology and 
Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of 
Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

PART 778_[AMENDED] 



3. Section 778.7 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (d)(1) to read as follows: 



 778.7 

Equipment and related technical data used in the design, 
development, production or use of missiles. 



* * * * * 



(a) * * * 

(1) 

Items subject to missile delivery systems controls.


The items that require a validated license because they are 
subject to foreign policy controls on missile delivery systems 
are contained within ECCNs designated by ``MT'' in the Reason for 
Control paragraph. Exporters should consult that paragraph in 
each ECCN to determine the specific item subject to these foreign 
policy controls. 



* * * * * 



(d) 

Licensing policy. 

(1) Applications to export the items will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export would
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. Applications for exports of items controlled for
MT by CCL category 7A or by ECCN 9A21 will be considered more favorably if such exports are determined to be destined
to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle or marine vessel, in quantities 
appropriate for replacement parts for such applications. When an export is deemed to make a material contribution
to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be denied. 



* * * * *

Guides for Advertising Shell Homes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Elimination of Guides.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission's Guides for Advertising Shell Homes (the ``Guides'') address the marketing of certain factory-built
homes that, on delivery, require further construction to be inhabitable. Due to lack of industry understanding of
the term ``shell homes'' and other circumstances, many sellers of factory-built housing have not viewed the Guides
as relevant to their sales practices. The Guides, to be made up-to-date, also would require extensive revision. Although
the revision and reissuance of the Guides might be warranted if there were evidence of significant marketing abuses
covered by the Guides, the Commission has no such evidence. It appears that likely abuses, if any, could be adequately
addressed by state and local housing code enforcement authorities. Accordingly, the Commission has determined
that the costs associated with revising and reissuing the Guides would outweigh the benefits, and the Guides should
be repealed.



Although the Commission is eliminating the Guides, proceedings still may be brought against businesses under section
5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1), for engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices
in or affecting commerce in the advertising and sale of these products.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction



As a part of its ongoing project to review all rules and guides, on September 11, 1992, the Commission invited comment
on the Guides for Advertising Shell Homes, 16 CFR Part 230.
 The notice contained six questions relating to the economic impact and continuing relevance of the Guides, any burdens
relating to adherence to them, any changes needed to minimize their economic impact, their relation to other federal
or state laws or regulations, and any changed conditions since they were issued and the effect of these changes on them.
The comment period ended on October 13, 1992. In response, one comment was received.







To obtain additional information about shell homes, staff contacted representatives of the National Institute
of Building Sciences, the Manufactured Housing Institute, the National Manufactured Housing Federation, and the
National Association of Home Manufacturers.
 Additionally, staff contacted nine randomly-selected manufacturers of factory-built housing from a directory
of over 250 such businesses
 and elicited comments and advertising materials from two manufacturers or sellers of factory-built houses or factory-built
housing components.
 On the basis of the information collected by the staff, it appeared that manufacturers of factory-built housing,
including manufacturers of housing the Commission has characterized as ``shell'' homes, are not familiar with the
Guides. This is because, in part, the term ``shell'' homes is not adequately defined in the Guides and is not a classification
used by any segment of today's factory-built housing industry.

Thus, if unlawful practices are occurring, the current Guides cannot perform their intended purpose of informing
industry of the Commission's views of the practices and providing the basis for their ``voluntary and simultaneous
abandonment'' by industry members.
 In order to provide adequate notice of the scope and applicability of the Guides to certain forms of factory-built
residential housing, the Guides would have to be revised to inform the relevant members of the industry that the Guides
apply to some of their marketing practices. However, under the circumstances this would be tantamount to issuing
new guides.





In these circumstances, the Commission has determined that revising or reissuing the Guides is necessary only if
there is reason to believe that unfair or deceptive practices are occurring in the relevant industry to some significant
extent or are likely to occur in the absence of Commission guides. Based on the response to the request for comment and
on the staff interviews with the responsible heads of the housing code authorities of California, Florida, Maryland,
Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, the Vice President of the National Foundation of Manufactured Home Owners
and a Senior Analyst from the American Association of Retired Persons, the Commission has determined that the practices
addressed by the Guides are not common and, to the extent they exist, are adequately handled by state or local housing
code authorities. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to repeal the Guides.



II. Background



On April 12, 1962, the Commission adopted the Guides under the authority of sections 5(a) (1) and 6(g) of the FTC Act,
5 U.S.C. 45(a)(1) and 46(g).
 The Guides address advertising claims relating to housing features that are material to consumers such as inhabitability
upon delivery, dimensions, included items, savings, availability of financing, guarantees, time of delivery or
installation, and whether the cost of delivery or installation is included in the advertised price. The Guides generally
reflected the law previously developed by the Commission in cases involving advertising for shell homes,
 factory-built homes,
 and home improvements.









There is no definition of shell homes in the Guides. Instead, section 230.1(a) states, ``* * * the 

typical

 shell home does not include such features as wiring, plumbing, heating, interior trim and finish, or other requisite
components * * *.'' (Emphasis added.) This and the cases brought before or around the time the Guides
were formulated
 indicate that the Commission intended the term ``shell'' to be interpreted in a generic sense_

i.e., 

structures assembled or installed in whole or in part by the seller that lack all the necessary components to make the
building inhabitable when delivered to the buyer.







Presently, it appears that other terms are now used in the industry to describe housing that the Commission characterized
as ``shell'' housing.
 For example, according to one source, a ``shell'' home is a ``pre-cut'' home under classifications established by
the National Association of Home Manufacturers (``NAHM'').
 There are also other industry terms for factory-built housing, such as ``panelized''
 and ``modular,''
 where the degree of completeness varies, and that may not be inhabitable as sold.

III. Review of the Guides



No member of the factory-built housing industry responded to the Commission's request for comment on the Guides.
 Part of the explanation for this may be that the term ``shell'' home as it is used by the Commission in the Guides is not
familiar to most current members of the industry.







Factory-built housing (including homes that are inhabitable upon delivery) constitutes a large segment of the new
home market. At this time the Commission does not know what portion of the factory-built housing industry is comprised
of structures erected in whole or in part by the seller that lack all the necessary components to make the building inhabitable
when delivered to the buyer. Based on the information collected by staff, it is probable that some portion of the industry
delivers structures that are not inhabitable.






Since adopting the Guides, the Commission has brought a number of actions that, without expressly mentioning the
Guides, reflect the principles articulated in them. Specifically, the Commission has prohibited manufacturers
of shell, pre-cut or other factory-built housing from:

 Representing that housing was complete to a greater degree than it was (Guide 1);






 Using pictorial advertising that confused higher-priced housing with prices of lower priced housing (Guide
3);






 Representing that unskilled consumers will realize savings on labor, or making false and unsubstantiated
claims with respect to the ease, economy or time involved in erecting the housing (Guide 4);






 Offering financing without disclosing terms, or misleading consumers with respect to the terms of the financing
available (Guide 5);

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Using bait-and switch tactics (Guide 6);
 and 





 Representing that housing is guaranteed without disclosing the nature and duration of the guarantee, the
identity of the guarantor and the manner in which the guarantor would perform (Guide 7).







Additionally, manufacturers of factory-built housing continue to make claims addressed by the Guides. For example,
the record reflects advertising claims with respect to inhabitability (Guide 1(,
 depictions of size or dimensions (Guide 2),
 pictorial representations of features not included (Guide 3),
 savings (guide 4),
 guarantees (Guide 7),
 and delivery and installation (Guide 9).
 However, the Commission has no basis to believe that the advertising it has monitored is deceptive or unfair.










IV. Evidence of Unlawful Practices



In order to obtain some evidence relating to the prevalence of the unfair or deceptive practices in the pertinent industry
staff interviewed the responsible heads of the housing code authorities of California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri,
New Jersey, Texas and Virginia.
 One interviewee, Bill Connolly, the Director of the Division of Codes and Standards in the New Jersey Department of
Community Affairs, is also the present chairman of the Industrialized Building Commission (the ``IBC''), the commissioners
of which comprise the housing code enforcement authorities of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Minnesota.
 Additionally, staff interviewed representatives of the National Foundation of Manufactured Home Owners and the
American Association of Retired Persons.








According to Mr. Connolly, approximately 35 states have adopted codes providing for in-factory approval of closed
construction residential structures (primarily modular housing). These codes contemplate a two-step process:
(1) Plan review, which occurs in the state, and (2) inspections in the plant, including out-of-state plants. Almost
universally, the states contract with third parties to conduct the out-of-state in-plant inspections. For open
construction factory-built buildings (

i.e.

, most panelized or all pre-cut housing), normally the local code enforcement authority will inspect the work as it
is assembled. As a result of these state and local enforcement activities, the sorts of problems consumers ordinarily
will encounter from factory-built housing almost exclusively consist of cosmetic or workmanship problems, or problems
arising in mounting the housing at the site. The other housing code authoritues agreed.
 Such problems are not covered by the Guides.





Staff's review indicates that, although relevant advertising exists and the affected industry is significant,
the unlawful practices addressed by the Guides do not appear to be widespread and, to the extent they may exist, state
or local housing code enforcement authorities can appropriately handle such problems. Although some problems of
the sorts addressed by the Guides may arise in sparsely populated areas of the country where there are no local housing
code authorities to inspect open construction factory-built buildings as they are assembled, the Commission has
no reason to believe these problems are significant or involve significant consumer harm. Accordingly, the Commission
has determined to repeal the Guides.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Syntex Animal Health. The supplemental NADA provides for reimplantation
of the drug combination progesterone/estradiol benzoate in steers fed in confinement for slaughter for additional
improvement in rate of weight gain.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Syntex Animal Health, Division of Syntex Agribusiness, Inc., 3401 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, filed a supplemental
NADA 9-576, which provides for reimplantation of Synovex

 

 S (200 milligrams (mg) of progesterone and 20 mg of estradiol benzoate per implant) at approximately day 70 in steers
fed in confinement for slaughter for additional improvement in rate of weight gain. The supplemental NADA is approved
as of August 19, 1994, and the regulations are amended in  522.1940 (21 CFR 522.1940) to reflect the approval.
The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary.


Section 522.1940(d)(2)(ii)) is revised to read ``For increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency,''
and paragraph (e) is redesignated as paragraph (d)(2)(iv), and it is amended by revising the first sentence and by
removing the second paragraph because it has been superseded by enactment of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1988.
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cometic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this
approval for food-producing animals qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning on August 19, 1994,
because the supplemental NADA contains a report of new clinical investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing
exclusivity applies only to the change in limitations (provides for the reimplantation of steers fed in confinement
for slaughter for additional improvement in rate of weight gain) for which the application is being approved. 
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

Quality Standards and Certification Requirements for Mammography Facilities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule; opportunity for public comment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing regulations to implement the Mammography Quality Standards Act
of 1992 (MQSA). The MQSA requires the establishment of a Federal certification and inspection program for mammography
facilities; regulations and standards for accrediting bodies for mammography facilities; and standards for mammography
equipment, personnel, and practices, including quality assurance. This regulation, which amends two previously
published interim rules, modifies and adds to the definitions previously set forth. In addition, the interim rule
provides a mechanism to request permission to meet alternative requirements, other than those previously set forth,
if the proposed alternative requirement is at least as effective as the existing quality standards in achieving quality
mammography services for women.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The MQSA (Pub. L. 102-539) was enacted to establish minimum, national quality standards for mammography. The
MQSA requires that, to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994, all facilities, except facilities
of the Department of Veterans Affairs, must be both accredited by an approved accrediting body and certified by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the Secretary). The authority to approve accreditation bodies and
to certify facilities has been delegated by the Secretary to FDA. 
The MQSA was passed on October 27, 1992, in response to statistics on the prevalence of breast cancer across the United
States. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. According
to the 1992 projections by the American Cancer Society, there would be 180,000 new cases of breast cancer among women
in the United States in just that year. Of these new cases, it was estimated that approximately 46,000 of these women
would die from the disease. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is increasing. In 1992, breast cancer affected
1 in 8 women in their lifetime as compared to 1 in 11 in 1980, 1 in 14 in 1960, and 1 in 20 in 1940. 
Early detection of breast cancer, typically involving physical breast examination and mammography, is the best
means of preventing deaths that result from breast cancer detected at an advanced stage. The value of undergoing mammography
screening is that mammography can detect cancers that are too small to be felt through physical examination (palpation).
Mammograms can detect breast cancer up to 2 years before a woman or her doctor can feel a lump. In addition, these early
stage cancers can be 90 to 100 percent curable (Ref. 1). 
However, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), a mammogram is one of the most difficult radiographic
images to read. It must have optimal clarity for the image to be interpreted correctly. If the image quality is poor
or the interpretation is faulty, the interpreter may miss an incipient cancerous lesion. This could delay treatment
and result in an avoidable death or mastectomy. Further, it is equally true that poor images or faulty interpretations
can lead to a false positive diagnosis, which produces needless patient anxiety, costly additional testing, and
painful biopsies when normal tissue is misread as abnormal.

The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held hearings on the breast cancer issue and found a wide range of
problems with the current mammography system: Poor quality equipment, the lack of quality assurance procedures,
poorly trained technologists and physicians, false representation of accreditation by some mammography facilities,
and the lack of inspections or consistent governmental oversight. The MQSA addresses these specific concerns by
establishing national minimum standards for all mammography facilities, except the Department of Veterans Affairs,
in the areas of radiation dose, equipment, personnel, and practices, such as quality control and quality assurance.
The MQSA replaces a patchwork of Federal, State, and private standards and guarantees sufficient oversight and enforcement
to ensure that women will receive high quality mammography services. 


II. Comments


To date, FDA has received 97 comments on the 2 interim rules that were published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565). These comments, which have been carefully reviewed and summarized,
are under consideration as the final regulations are being developed. FDA will publish its response to the various
comments in the 

Federal Register

 when the final rules are published. 


III. Effective Date


The effective date of this regulation is October 1, 1994. 
Although the effective date of a final regulation ordinarily may not be less than 30 days after date of publication
in the 

Federal Register

, the Administrative Procedures Act and FDA's regulations permit exceptions to this timeframe when: (1) The regulation
grants an exemption or relieves a restriction; (2) the regulation interprets rules and policy statements; or, (3)
good cause exists and is published for the earlier date. This interim rule satisfies any one or all of the exemption
criteria that permit an earlier effective date. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(d) and 21 CFR 10.40(c)(4).) 
First, this interim rule exempts certain mammography devices and procedures from quality standards established
under the MQSA. Second, the interim rule provides a means for proposing alternative standards that may relieve restrictions
for certain mammography facilities. Third, the interim rule provides interpretive definitions and FDA policy statements
to clarify essential terms in rules previously issued under the MQSA. Finally, failure to implement this interim
rule by October 1, 1994, could inadvertently render critical mammography devices and procedures illegal that are
not currently intended to be covered under the MQSA. Therefore, the agency finds good cause for an effective date fewer
than 30 days after publication of this regulation. Accordingly, for all these reasons, this interim rule is made effective
as of October 1, 1994. 


IV. Legislative Authority 


December 14, 1993, the President signed legislation (H. Rept. 2202) granting interim rule authority to the Secretary
for promulgation of standards required by the MQSA. This authorization was provided in recognition of the fact that
the certification deadline of October 1, 1994, could not be met without streamlining the process for initial promulgation
of standards. Because of the perceived urgent public health need for Federal standards for mammography, it was decided
that interim rule authority should be granted, rather than an extension of the deadline to develop standards. 
Under the interim rule legislation, the Secretary is authorized to issue temporary, interim regulations setting
forth standards for approving accrediting bodies and for quality standards for mammography, under section 354(e)
and 354(f) of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 263b(e) and 354(f)). Under the abbreviated process,
the Secretary is required to adopt existing standards to the maximum extent feasible, such as those established by
the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), private voluntary accreditation bodies, e.g., the American College
of Radiology (ACR), and some States. Also, in developing the interim regulations, the Secretary is not required to
consult with the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee). However, after
the interim standards are issued, Congress intended that the Secretary proceed with the more extensive rulemaking
procedures envisioned by the original enactment of the MQSA, including the statutorily required consultation with
the Advisory Committee. 
FDA used this authority to issue interim requirements for accrediting bodies, quality standards, and certification
on December 21, 1993. Those interim standards have been used to approve accreditation bodies and certify facilities
before the October 1, 1994, deadline. However, since the interim regulations were published on December 1993, FDA's
experience in applying those interim standards has convinced the agency that certain amendments to those interim
rules are necessary in order to clarify the obligation that facilities have to meet under MQSA by the October 1, 1994,
deadline. The regulations implemented by this interim rule add to and modify the interim rules issued on December
21, 1993, and will remain in effect until final regulations are proposed and promulgated in 1995. 


V. Provisions of the Rule 


A. Amended Definition 


FDA's experience in developing standards and planning for implementation of the MQSA over the past year has made the
agency aware that certain changes to its previously published interim definitions are necessary.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 900.2 (21 CFR 900.2) of the December 21, 1993, interim rule (58 FR 67558 at 67563) defines essential terms used
throughout the interim rules. These definitions are intended to inform mammography facilities and consumers of
the meaning of terminology used throughout the MQSA regulations. This interim rule amends and modifies certain terms
defined in  900.2. 
In determining which facilities would be subject to the standards under the MQSA, Congress defined the term ``facility''
to include a hospital, outpatient department, clinic, radiology practice, or mobile unit, an office of a physician,
or other facility, as determined by the Secretary, and, by delegation, FDA, that conducts breast cancer screening
or diagnosis through mammography activities. The term does not include a facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Congress further defined mammography ``activities'' to include the operation of equipment to produce a mammogram,
the processing of film, the initial interpretation of the mammogram, and the (maintenance of) viewing conditions
for that interpretation. However, Congress recognized that a mammogram may be performed in a place that is different
from the facility that processes or interprets the x-ray film. In such a case, the MQSA requires the facility performing
the mammogram to be responsible for meeting the MQSA quality standards. 

Under this interim rule, FDA is amending the definition of ``facility'' under  900.2 to clarify that it is the
facility performing the mammogram that is responsible for obtaining accreditation by an FDA-approved accrediting
body and certification by FDA to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994. The facility performing
the mammogram must substantiate that the additional mammography activities of processing the x-ray film, interpreting
the image, and maintaining viewing conditions, wherever performed, meet all quality standards required under the
MQSA. Facilities that provide only partial services (e.g., film processing companies or interpreting radiologists)
are not required at this time to apply for accreditation or certification under MQSA, although these partial providers
will have to meet MQSA standards in order to be employed by any facility that performs mammograms. In the future, FDA
may require facilities that perform any portion of the process required for a mammography evaluation to be directly
subject to the accreditation and certification process. 
In addition, although the MQSA excludes facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from the scope of the
legislation, VA is working to establish standards consistent with this legislation. All other facilities that conduct
the following screening or diagnostic mammography activities are subject to the standards issued under the MQSA.

B. New Definitions 


This interim rule is adding the new terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography'' to  900.2
in order to clarify which breast cancer screening or diagnostic mammography activities conducted by a facility will
render that facility subject to the provisions of and regulations issued under the MQSA, and which activities are
excluded from regulation. Under the MQSA, Congress defined the term ``mammography'' as radiography of the breast,
but provided no statutory definition for the terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography.''
This interim rule is adding the terms ``screening mammography'' and ``diagnostic mammography'' to the definition
portion of the regulations in order to clarify the scope of the regulated mammography activities. These definitions
are based on definitions developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and the ACR, and have been
modified as necessary for purposes of MQSA implementation. 
The term ``screening mammography'' is being defined as mammography performed on an asymptomatic patient to detect
the presence of breast cancer at an early stage. In screening mammography, the patient typically has not manifested
any clinical signs, symptoms, or physical findings of breast cancer. The screening mammogram is performed to detect
the presence of a breast abnormality in its incipient stage and to serve as a baseline film to which future screening
or diagnostic mammograms may be compared. 
The term ``diagnostic mammography'' is being defined as mammography performed on a patient with clinical signs,
symptoms, or physical findings suggestive of breast cancer; an abnormal or questionable screening mammogram; a
history of breast cancer with breast conservation surgery regardless of absence of clinical breast signs, symptoms,
or physical findings; or, augmented breasts regardless of absence of clinical breast signs, symptoms, or physical
findings. Diagnostic mammography is also called problem-solving mammography or consultative mammography. A diagnostic
mammogram is performed because there is a reasonable articulable suspicion that an abnormality may exist in the breast.
The diagnostic mammogram may confirm or deny the presence of an abnormality and, if confirmed, may assist in determining
the nature of the problem. 
FDA has further defined the terms screening and diagnostic mammography to exclude breast imaging performed in a research
setting as part of a scientific study to evaluate experimental mammography devices conducted in accordance with
FDA's investigational device exemption regulations in 21 CFR part 812. Science has not progressed to the point where
effective quality standards may be written for every category of experimental mammography device. Therefore, at
this time these investigational devices for breast radiography will not be subject to the quality standards issued
under the MQSA. However, any conventional mammography device used as part of the scientific study to provide baseline
data from which to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental device would be subject to MQSA quality standards.

In addition, invasive interventions which employ breast radiography devices to produce radiographic images of
the breast in association with localization or biopsy (e.g., stereotactic x-ray) procedures have also been excluded
from the definitions of screening and diagnostic mammography activities. 
In the future, when the science has advanced to a point where effective, national quality standards may be developed,
FDA may regulate facilities that employ these invasive interventions or facilities that employ experimental devices
for breast radiography to ensure their compliance under the act.

C. Alternative Standards 



FDA recognizes that there may be alternative standards to the standards issued in  900.12 (21 CFR 900.12) of
the 

Federal Register

 of December 12, 1993 (58 FR 67565), that are at least as effective in delivering high quality mammography services
to women. In the interest of improving the overall quality of mammography, FDA wants to provide an avenue by which safe
and effective alternative standards may be implemented. Accordingly, the agency has created a mechanism for qualified
applicants to request permission to meet an alternative standard rather than an existing quality standard. The request
must be supported by such evidence as required by the agency to render a determination that the suggested alternative
is at least as effective as the agency mandated standard in helping to achieve high quality mammography. 

If the agency determines that the proposed alternative is acceptable, the agency will grant the request. The applicant
will receive written notice of the approval of the alternative standard, including any limitations on use of the alternative,
and the period of time that the alternative may be employed. The decision will be placed in the public docket file in
the Dockets Management Branch (address above), after deletion of any patient identifiers or confidential commercial
information, and may also be published in the form of a notice in the 

Federal Register

. 

Other entities that desire to use the alternative standard must also submit an application and receive approval by
the agency before they may substitute the alternative for the agency mandated standard. FDA anticipates that ``me-too''
entities filing an application in accordance with the regulations typically would receive a prompt response to the
request. This process is necessary to ensure that those other entities wishing to avail themselves of the alternative
fully understand and appreciate the alternative procedure and its applicability so that the overall quality of mammography
services is maintained. However, if a manufacturer of mammography equipment applies to the agency for approval of
an alternative standard based on particular characteristics of that manufacturers's equipment, FDA approval of
that alternative standard would apply to all facilities using that manufacturer's equipment. 



VI. Quality Assurance Standards: Screen-Film 



FDA is amending the quality assurance (QA) standard for screen-film systems. Section 900.12(d)(1)(i) (58 FR 67565
at 67572) requires the screen-film QA program for a mammography facility to be substantially the same as that described
in the 1992 edition of ``Mammography Quality Control: Radiologist's Manual, Radiologic Technologists Manual and
Medical Physicist's Manual.'' Recently, the 1994 edition of the manual has been published. FDA has evaluated the
revised QA screen-film program in this latest edition and determined that either the 1992 version or the 1994 version
of the program can serve as the basis for a facility's screen-film QA program. FDA is amending  900.12(d)(1)(i)
to reflect this change.

VII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



This interim rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). The title, description, and respondent description
of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden.
Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 



Title: 

Quality Standards and Certification Requirements for Mammography Facilities. 



Description: 

FDA is issuing an interim rule to implement the certification and quality standards provisions of the MQSA. This regulation,
which amends two previously published interim rules, modifies and adds to the definitions previously set forth.
In addition, the interim rule provides a mechanism to request 
permission to meet alternative requirements, other than those 
previously set forth, if the proposed alternative requirement is 
at least as effective as the existing quality standards in 
achieving quality mammography services for women. 

As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA is submitting a copy of this interim rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspects of these information collection requirements,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above)
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, D.C.
20503, Attention: Desk Officer for FDA.

VIII. Environmental Impact



The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.



IX. Economic Impact



FDA has examined the impacts of the interim rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this interim rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the interim rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because a request for an alternative requirement is a voluntary action by the applicant
and the amended definitions limit the current applicability of these requirements, the agency certifies that the
interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.



X. References



The following reference has been placed on display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen
by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

XI. Request for Comments



Interested persons may, on or before December 29, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this interim rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may
submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.
Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Although these amendments
to the interim regulations become effective October 1, 1994, FDA will consider and evaluate all comments it receives
as part of its ongoing work on the final rules.

Quality and Radiation Programs (the Director), may approve an alternative to a quality standard under  900.12,
when the Director determines that:

(1) The proposed alternative standard will be at least as effective in assuring quality mammography as the standard
it proposes to replace, and

(2) The proposed alternative:

(i) Is too limited in its applicability to justify amending the standard, or

(ii) Offers an expected benefit to public health which is so great that the time required for the processing of an amendment
to the standard would present an unjustifiable risk to public health, and

(3) The granting of the alternative is in keeping with the purposes of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992.

(b) 

Applicants for alternatives.

 (1) Mammography facilities and accreditation bodies may apply for alternatives to the quality standards of  900.12.

(2) State governments that are not accrediting bodies may apply for alternatives to the standards of  900.12(a).

(3) Manufacturers and assemblers of equipment used for mammography may apply for alternatives to the standards of
 900.12 (b), (c), and (d).

(c) 

Application for approval of an alternative standard.

 An application for approval of an alternative standard or for an amendment or extension of the alternative standard
shall be submitted in an original and two copies to the Director, Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs,
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ-240), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857. The application for approval of an alternative standard shall include the following information:

(1) Identification of the original standard for which the alternative standard is being proposed and an explanation
of why it is believed necessary to propose the alternative;

(2) A description of the manner in which the alternative is proposed to deviate from the original standard;

(3) A description, supported by data, of the advantages to be derived from such deviation;

(4) An explanation, supported by data, of how such a deviation would assure equal or greater quality of production,
processing, or interpretation of mammograms than the original standard;

(5) The suggested period of time that the proposed alternative standard would be in effect; and

(6) Such other information required by the Director to evaluate and act on the application.

(d) 

Ruling on applications.

 (1) The Director may approve or deny, in whole or in part, a request for approval of an alternative standard or any amendment
or extension thereof, and shall inform the applicant in writing of this action. The written notice will state the manner
in which the requested alternative standard differs from the agency standard and a summary of the reasons for approval
or denial of the request. If the request is approved, the written notice will also include the effective date and the
termination date of the approval, a summary of the limitations and conditions attached to the approval, and any other
information that may be relevant to the approved request. Each approved alternative standard will be assigned an
identifying number.

(2) Notice of an approved request for an alternative standard or any amendment or extension thereof will be placed
in the public docket file in the office of the Dockets Management Branch and may also be in the form of a notice published
in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will state the name of the applicant, a description of the published agency standard, and a description

(including written notices of approval) on these applications will be available for public disclosure in the Dockets
Management Branch, excluding patient identifiers and confidential commercial information.

(e) 

Amendment or extension of an alternative standard.

 An application for amending or extending approval of an alternative standard shall include the following information:

(1) The approval number and the expiration date of the alternative standard;

(2) The amendment or extension requested and the basis for the amendment or extension; and

(3) An explanation, supported by data, of how such an amendment or extension would assure equal or greater quality
of production, processing, or interpretation of mammograms than the original standard.

(f) 

Applicability of the alternative standards.

 Any approval of an alternative standard, amendment, or extension may be implemented only by the entity to which it
was granted and under the terms under which it was granted, except that when an alternative standard is approved for
a manufacturer of equipment, any facility using that equipment will also be covered by the alternative standard.
Other entities interested in similar or identical approvals must file their own application by following the provisions
of  900.18(c).

(g) 

Withdrawal of approval of alternative standards.

 The Director shall amend or withdraw approval of an alternative standard whenever the Director determines that this
action is necessary to protect the public health or otherwise is justified by  900.12. Such action will become
effective on the date specified in the written notice of the action sent to the applicant, except that it will become
effective immediately upon notification of the applicant when the Director determines that such action is necessary
to prevent an imminent health hazard.

Payment of Insurance Claims by Book Entry Form of Debentures and Statute of Limitations on Payment of Distributive
Shares 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule implements provisions in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 that authorize the Secretary
to pay mortgage insurance claims with book entry forms of debentures and establish a statute of limitations on payments
of Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund distributive shares. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule implements two provisions contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550,
approved October 28, 1992 (the 1992 Act). Section 516 of the 1992 Act amends sections 204, 207, 220 and 221(g), of the
National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of HUD to pay virtually any mortgage insurance claim in book entry
or other form of debentures an well as in the current certificated registered form. Section 508 of the 1992 Act establishes
a 6-year statute of limitation on the payment of distributive shares from the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. 


Authority To Pay Mortgage Insurance Claims With 
Book Entry and Other Forms of Debentures 


The rule amends parts 200, 203, 207, 220, 221, 235, 236, 237, 241 and 242 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to authorize payment of mortgage insurance claims with book entry or other forms of debentures. 
Under HUD's mortgage insurance programs, when a mortgage goes into default, the mortgagee is entitled to receive
insurance benefits that are payable in cash or debentures. HUD currently pays most, but not all, claims in cash. One
notable exception is that, under section 221(g)(4) of the National Housing Act, holders of single family mortgages
insured under section 221 that are current after 20 years from final endorsement may assign the mortgages to HUD and
receive debentures in exchange. Holders of current section 221 multifamily mortgages may likewise assign such mortgages
to HUD in exchange for debentures if the mortgage is not sold through the auction process mandated by section 221(g)(4)(C).
HUD also issues debentures for the difference between the amount of redeemed debentures and the amount of the mortgage
insurance premium due, when mortgagees pay their MIP and then exercise their right to send in the debentures for redemption.

Since 1938, the Department of the Treasury has acted as Fiscal Agent for the Federal Housing Administration and HUD
with respect to debentures, and has carried out debenture processing functions on FHA's and HUD's behalf. Since 1988,
Treasury has delegated much of the debenture processing functions to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (FRBP)
acting in its capacity as Fiscal Agent of the United States. The computer system used by FRBP is designed to accommodate
use of book entry, as well as certificated debentures. Processing book entry debentures is considerably less costly
than processing certificated debentures. Section 516 of the 1992 Act provides explicit statutory authority for
HUD to convert to a book entry system.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under current statutory authority, FRBP issues certificated debentures in multiples of $50, and issues a cash adjustment
for the balance. The certificated debenture system is extremely cumbersome and expensive to administer, since FRBP
must have the debenture stock printed, store and handle the debenture stock under secure conditions, process the
issuance of debentures manually, transmit the debentures physically, and issue the cash adjustment separately.
The certificated debentures are also cumbersome and expensive for holders to store and negotiate. Such debentures
must be held under secure conditions, and the pledging and assignment through physical transfer could cause delays
or lead to loss or theft. 
Because of these considerations, Treasury and a number of Federal government agencies have switched from certificated
to book entry securities, a shift paralleled in the equity and corporate and municipal bond markets. However, since
Congress apparently contemplated the use of certificated debentures when it enacted the current provisions of sections
204, 207, and 220 of the National Housing Act, Section 516 of the 1992 Act was enacted to clarify HUD's authority to pay
claims through the issuance of book entry debentures. 
With enactment of section 516, the book entry system administered by FRBP can be put into operation. Effective with
this rule, HUD will have authority to issue debentures in book entry form. HUD intends to implement this authority
in the very near future with respect to issuance of all new debentures. An announcement of the implementation will
be made prior to its effective date. Also, once this new authority is implemented, debentures issued for amounts remaining
after payment of mortgage insurance premiums may also be in book entry form. In addition, holders of outstanding certificated
debentures may, at their option, exchange such debentures for book entry securities. Debentures in book entry form
will not thereafter be exchangeable for debentures in certificated form. Book entry debentures will be issued in
a minimum amount of one dollar and increments of one cent. This will allow debentures to be issued in virtually the exact
amount payable to the holder, with no cash adjustment. Interest and principal payments on book entry debentures will
be made by direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) to the account and financial institution designated by the
owners of the debentures. Considerable savings will accrue, both to the Federal government and to holders of debentures,
by thus bringing the FHA debenture process into conformity with modern commercial practices. 


Establish a Statute of Limitations on Payments 
of Distributive Shares 


The rule also implements section 508 of the 1992 Act by amending 24 CFR Part 203 to establish a six-year statute of limitations
within which an individual who is eligible for the payment of a distributive share could claim his or her distributive
share. The amendment also transfers amounts no longer eligible for distribution because of the statute of limitations
from the Participating Reserve Account to the General Surplus Account to help ensure the actuarial soundness of the
Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. 


Publication as Final Rule 


It is the policy of the Department to publish rules for public comment before developing a rule for effect. However,
in a particular case where notice and public comment are not required by statute, the procedure for advance public
comment may be omitted if the Department determines that it is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public
interest. In this case, revisions to the regulations are limited to those needed to reflect the clear Congressional
mandate to effect a 6-year statute of limitations on claims for distributive shares and to provide authority to issue
debentures in book entry form. The Department would not be able to change the minimal provisions it is setting forth
in this rule in response to public comments because of the specificity of the statute being implemented. Consequently,
we believe it unnecessary to accept and review public comments before putting into effect these statutory provisions.



Other Matters 


Regulatory Flexibility 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
rule does have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule implements Congressional
mandates which will prove cost beneficial for affected business entities both large and small.

NEPA 



Under HUD regulations (24 CFR 50.20(k)), this rule is exempt from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act as set forth in 24 CFR Part 50. The rule relates to internal administrative procedures, the content of which
does not involve development decisions, and does not affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites
but only relates to the payment of insurance claims and distributive shares. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism

, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or 
their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review
under the order. The rule does not effect any change in current relationships between HUD, the private sector and state
and local governmental entities. 



Executive Order 12606, The Family



The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family, 

has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and
general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies
or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.




Regulatory Agenda. 

This rule was listed as item 1597 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424, 20450) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); Continued Health Care Benefit Program




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule establishes a Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) for certain DoD and other Uniformed Services
health care beneficiaries who lose eligibility for health care in the Military Health Services System (MHSS). It
also provides for use of the CHAMPUS benefit structure and CHAMPUS rules and outlines procedures for the CHCBP.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


1. Overview of the Final Rule



On April 6, 1994, an interim final rule regarding benefits and operational issues associated with implementation
of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) was published (59 FR 16136).

The CHCBP was directed by Congress in section 4408 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993,
Public Law 102-484, which amended title 10, United States Code, by adding section 1078a. This law directed the
implementation of a program of temporary continued health benefits coverage for certain former beneficiaries of
the Department of Defense, comparable to the health benefits provided for former civilian employees of the Federal
government.

Congress also directed that the program start by October 1, 1994, and replace the conversion health care programs
authorized in 10 U.S.C. 1086a and 1145(b). Conversion health care is provided via a DoD contract with Mutual of Omaha
and is scheduled to end September 30, 1994.

The statute directs that the benefits offered by the CHCBP must be comparable to those offered to former civilian employees
of the Federal government. As is the case for those employees, the costs will be borne by the beneficiary who will pay
the entire premium charge. Additionally, the Department of Defense is permitted to charge up to an additional ten
percent of the premium charge to cover administrative expenses.

Under section 4408(b), eligibility to enroll in the CHCBP includes members of the Uniformed Services who are discharged
or released (voluntarily or involuntarily as long as not under adverse conditions) and their dependents; certain
unremarried former spouses of a member or former member; and emancipated children.

Health care coverage in the CHCBP is for a specific time period, which varies by the category of beneficiary. Coverage
periods are as follows: Former uniformed services members and their dependents_up to 18 months; unremarried former
spouses_up to 36 months; emancipated children (age 21 if not in college or up to age 23 if in college)_up to 36 months.
Eligible beneficiaries generally will have 60 days to elect coverage after they are notified of their opportunity
to enroll.

The Department of Defense considered three alternatives to implement this program: First, integration of the program
within the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) health care plans under arrangement with the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM); second, competitive procurement of a private insurer to administer this program; and
lastly, continued CHAMPUS-type coverage, paid for by the beneficiary, with a third party administrator collecting
the premiums and performing eligibility and verification functions. The first option was rejected based on the difficulties
of making the transition from a DoD administered benefit to an OPM program. The second option was not selected based
on the likelihood that an acquisition process involving a beneficiary group of such unpredictable size and characteristics
would not result in a vendor willing to underwrite this program. Contractors would be wary that health care costs would
exceed the capped premium. Thus, we elected to offer this program directly through the established mechanisms of
CHAMPUS.

Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures
to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts
and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted,
a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive
applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment
and Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services.
CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions
at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits
Advisor (HBA).
Congressional legislation caps premiums at a level equal to that of a comparable mid-range Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) program offered in the FEHBP. These premium rates were determined by category plan_either self or family and
are not age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Quarterly premium rates for fiscal year 1995 will
be: $410 for self and $891 for family.

Following is a discussion of the comments we received regarding the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, and the
action we are taking in response.



1. Quarterly Premium Rates





Interim Final Rule.

 The interim final rule states that the Department has contracted with a private sector actuarial firm to help develop
premium rates.



Comment 1A.

 An organization has requested that the estimated rates be updated with the actual rates to be charged once they have
been calculated.



Response.

 The following will be the FY95 quarterly premium rates for the CHCBP. Self_$410; Family_$891. 



2. Transitional Health Care Coverage





Interim Final Rule.

 The interim final rule states the medical coverage for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) will be offered
via the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).



Comment 2A.

 An organization of the military coalition has recommended that DoD offer transitional health benefits coverage
through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP), not CHAMPUS.



Response.

 The Department requested the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consider granting CHCBP beneficiaries authority
to select health care from their list of FEHBP programs or to make CHCBP an FEHBP program. OPM opposed this request.
Additionally, the requirement to cover preexisting conditions for new enrollees would make FEHBP private insurers
unlikely to enroll CHCBP beneficiaries. Therefore, standard CHAMPUS was considered the most feasible means of ensuring
entitled care.

On January 19, 1988, (53 FR 1343), the Department of Defense published a rule, ``Voluntary Private Health Insurance
Conversion Program.'' This subject has been incorporated into 32 CFR part 199, section 199.20. Therefore, 32 CFR
part 104 is removed.



II. Rulemaking Procedures



Executive Order 12866 requires certain regulatory assessments for any ``significant regulatory action,'' defined
as one which would result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or have other substantial impacts.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires that each Federal agency prepare, and make available for public comment,
a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation which would have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

This is not a significant regulatory action under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and it would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The final rule will impose additional information collection requirements on the public under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 USC 3501-3511), because beneficiaries will be required to enroll. OMB has granted conditional
approval based on their intention of reviewing the Application Form upon its completion.

Accordingly, by the authority of 10 U.S.C. 301, 32 CFR Part 104 is removed and Part 199 is amended as follows:



PART 104_[REMOVED]
PART 199_[AMENDED]


1. The authority citation for Part 199 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 301; 10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086.





2. Section 199.20 is revised as follows:



 199.20



Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP).



(a) 

Purpose. 

The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries
(set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered
via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator.
The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules
and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for the
Department of Defense and the other Uniformed Services (e.g., NOAA, PHS, and the Coast Guard) health care beneficiaries
losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of CHAMPUS.

(b) 

General provisions. 

Except for any provisions the Director, OCHAMPUS may exclude, the general provisions of section 199.1 shall apply
to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS.

(c) 

Definitions. 

Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in section 199.2 are relevant to
the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS.

(d)

(q) 

Premiums_

(1) 

Rates.

 Premium rates will be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) for two rate groups_individual
and family. Eligible beneficiaries will select the level of coverage they require at the time of initial enrollment
(either individual or family) and pay the appropriate premium payment. The rates are based on Federal Employee Health
Benefit Program employee and agency contributions required for a comparable health benefits plan, plus an administrative
fee. The administrative fee, not to exceed ten percent of the basic premium amount, shall be determined based on actual
expected administrative costs for administration of the program. Premiums may be revised annually and shall be published
annually for each fiscal year. Premiums will be paid by enrollees quarterly. 

(2) Effects of failure to make premium payments. Failure by enrollees to submit timely and proper premium payments
will result in denial of continued enrollment and denial of payment of medical claims. Premium payments which are
late 30 days or more past the start of the quarter for which payment is due will result in the ending of beneficiary enrollment.
Beneficiaries denied continued enrollment due to lack of premium payments will not be allowed to reenroll. In such
a case, benefit coverage will cease at the end of the ninety day (90) period for which a premium payment was received.
Enrollees will be held liable for medical costs incurred after losing eligibility.

(r) 

Transitional provisions.

 (1) There will be a sixty-day period of enrollment for all eligible beneficiaries (outlined in paragraph (d)(1) of
this section) whose entitlement to regular military health services system coverage ended on or after August 2, 1994,
but prior to the CHCBP implementation on October 1, 1994.

(2) Enrollment in the U.S. VIP program may continue up to October 1, 1994. Policies written prior to October 1, 1994,
will remain in effect until the end of the policy life.

(3) On or after the October 1, 1994, implementation of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, beneficiaries who
enrolled in the U.S. VIP program prior to October 1, 1994, may elect to cancel their U.S. VIP policy and enroll in the
CHCBP.

(4) With the exception of persons enrolled in the U.S. VIP program who may convert to the CHCBP, individuals who lost
their entitlement to regular military health services system coverage prior to August 2, 1994, are not eligible for
the CHCBP.

(s) 

Procedures.

 The Director, OCHAMPUS, may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the Continued Health
Care Benefit Program.

Special Local Regulation; Head of the Connecticut Regatta



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The special local regulations for the Head of the Connecticut Regatta are being permanently revised to improve the
control of vessels transiting the Connecticut River near the regulated area. This regulation is needed to better
protect race participants from recreational and commercial vessel traffic.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information




The drafters of this document are LTJG B.M. Algeo, Project Manager, First Coast Guard District, and LCDR S.R. Watkins,
Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists
for making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. The Head of the Connecticut Regatta is an event of longstanding tradition. The local community is well
aware of the conditions necessary to conduct the event in a safe manner. Last year, the provisions of this rule were
used to temporarily amend the permanent regulation found in 33 CFR 100.105. Based on the positive experience with
that temporary rule change, the Coast Guard believes this amended regulation will allow the race to be conducted in
the safest manner possible while minimizing the impact on other boaters. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event
would be contrary to the public interest given the significant public participation in the regatta and the extensive
planning which has taken place.


Background and Purpose



The permanent special local regulations for the Head of the Connecticut Regatta are found at 33 CFR 100.105. These
regulations have become outdated insofar as section 100.105(b)(2) allows vessels less than 20 meters to transit
the regulated area between each heat of the regatta. The number of racing shells and vessels transiting along the race
course has grown to such a level that it is no longer safe to allow vessels to transit the regulated area between each
heat. Regardless of the amount of planning and control in past years, racing shells have not followed the predetermined
traffic patterns designed to allow vessels to transit the regulated area between heats. The race sponsor and the Coast
Guard have developed a race and escort plan for the regatta which will allow vessels to transit the regulated area under
escort throughout the race. Accordingly, section 100.105(b)(2) is being revised to allow vessel transits through
the regulated area only at the discretion of, and under the escort of, the Coast Guard patrol commander. Based on the
successful use of this provision during last year's race, the Coast Guard considers this permanent change to the regulation
advisable in the interest of safety.


Regulatory Evaluation




This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation, under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT, is unnecessary.

Commercial traffic on the affected portion of the Connecticut River is sparse. The race is popular and is anticipated
to draw business to the local community. Local commercial entities have been notified of the race schedule. Because
of the short duration of the event and the advisories that will be made, commercial entities will be able to adjust to
any disruptions. The permanent change should reduce the amount of time it takes for nonparticipants to transit through
the regulated area, thus further limiting the impact of the rule.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

For the reasons explained in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be minimal and certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100



Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Waterways.



Final Regulation



In consideration of the foregoing, 33 CFR Part 100 is amended as follows:

1. The authority citation for Part 100 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

33 U.S.C. 1233; 49 CFR 1.46 and 33 CFR 100.35.




2. Section 100.105 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(2) as follows:

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Gallants Channel, Beaufort, NC



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is changing the regulations governing the U.S. 70 Bridge across Gallants Channel, mile 0.1, in Beaufort,
North Carolina, by extending the hours of restricted openings from the current 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. timeframe to
the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This rule also further limits the number of openings required during the hours of restrictions.
From 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., the bridge will open three times an hour; once on the hour, once twenty minutes past the hour and
once forty minutes past the hour for all waiting vessels, commercial and recreational. From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., the bridge
shall open on signal. This rule is intended to provide for regularly scheduled drawbridge openings to reduce motor
vehicle traffic delays and congestion resulting from bridge openings while still providing for the reasonable needs
of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD05-94-046)
and the specific section of this rulemaking to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The
Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and
electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rulemaking in view
of the comments.

At this time, the Coast Guard plans no public hearing, however, if future public interest and new information warrants,
a public hearing may be held. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Commander (ob) at the address under


ADDRESSES.

 The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Bill H. Brazier, Project Officer, and LCDR C. Abel, Project Attorney, Fifth Coast
Guard District.



Regulatory History



The Coast Guard published a Temporary Deviation from the regulations for the Beaufort U.S. 70 drawbridge across Gallant's
Channel in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38567) on July 29, 1994. The expiration date of the deviation is September 30, 1994. The purpose of the deviation
was to evaluate a modification to the current published regulation. Comments on the temporary deviation were solicited
through September 30, 1994. The Coast Guard also published the temporary deviation as a public notice (PN 5-834)
on July 29, 1994. Comments were solicited through September 30, 1994. Two comments have been received.

Background and Purpose



The Carteret County Chamber of Commerce, through the North Carolina Department of Transportation, asked the Coast
Guard to change the operating regulations governing the Beaufort U.S. 70 highway bridge by limiting required bridge
openings for commercial boats to one opening at the top of each hour, and for recreational boats to one opening at the
bottom of the hour. To supplement this request, they provide copies of bridge logs which showed the bridge opened as
many as eight times an hour for the passage of vessels during the summer of 1993. The Coast Guard also obtained traffic
counts from the North Carolina Department of Transportation which showed average annual vehicle traffic counts
of 20,000 per day during the same period. The current Federal Regulation for this bridge requires that it open every
hour on the half hour from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. for the passage of pleasure craft. During these same hours, the bridge
is required to open on signal for all other vessels. From 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m., the bridge opens on signal for all vessels.
The numerous random openings of the bridge under this regulation were causing vehicular traffic delays and traffic
safety problems. At times, bridge openings backed traffic up through the downtown area of Beaufort to the east and
west Morehead City across the channel. The intent of the requested change was to reduce the number of bridge openings
and improve the flow of highway traffic.

The Coast Guard conducted an investigation into the operations of the bridge, consulting with the bridge tenders,
the Mayor and City Council of Beaufort, North Carolina Department of Transportation officials and some of the local
commercial waterway and highway users. The Coast Guard, in response to all comments received during our investigation,
decided to pursue a more balanced approach than that originally requested by establishing a temporary deviation
to the regulations and evaluating the results of that test schedule to determine if it resulted in a reasonable and
beneficial compromise for both modes of transportation. The Coast Guard conducted the test for a sixty day period
which provided three scheduled openings per hour for all vessels; the first at the top of the hour, the second at twenty
minutes past the hour, and the third at forty minutes past the hour. The temporary deviation also extended the hours
of restricted openings from the current 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. timeframe to include the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This
temporary deviation to the existing regulation was intended to establish a schedule that will meet the reasonable
needs of the waterway users and at the same time reduce delays to and improve the flow of highway traffic crossing the
bridge.

The Coast Guard anticipated the test would show that the total overall number of bridge openings would decrease during
the trial period as compared to the same period in 1993. Data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation
from August 1, through August 19, 1994 showed that under the temporary deviation, the number of bridge openings during
the hours of restriction was reduced by over 100 compared to the number of openings during the same dates and hours in
1993. North Carolina Department of Transportation traffic officials also stated they noted no significant highway
traffic backups as a result of bridge openings during the test period. Although the Coast Guard has not yet received
the additional bridge opening and highway traffic data collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation
during the remainder of the test period, all indications are that results will continue to show a reduction in the number
of bridge openings and on improvement in the flow of highway traffic across the bridge. Based on the lack of complaints
received during the test period, the positive written and verbal comments received on the test schedule by concerned
interest groups, the demonstrated positive results shown through data collected from August 1 through August 19,
and the unanimous request of all who have contacted the Coast Guard not to revert to the previous opening schedule,
the Coast Guard believes it is in the public interest to continue the opening schedule used during the test period without
interruption by publishing this interim rule. For the reasons above, it would be contrary to the public interest to
revert to the existing regulation upon expiration of the temporary deviation and therefore, good cause exists for
publishing this rule without prior notice and opportunity for comment, and making it effective in less than the 30
days after publication normally required. This rule should be effective immediately because it is in the overall
public interest to do so, and the Coast Guard is not aware of any reasons not to.

Discussion of Comments



The Coast Guard received two written comments in response to our public notice concerning the temporary deviation
to the regulations for the Gallant's Channel drawbridge. Both comments were from Beaufort City Officials (the Mayor
and the Town Administrator). Both comments were favorable and expressed the belief that the temporary deviation
had improved the flow of highway traffic across the bridge and reduced highway traffic delays previously attributable
to frequent, unscheduled openings of the bridge. Verbal comments received by the Coast Guard from State Highway Officials,
bridgetenders, a local county chamber of commerce and a representative of the commercial marine industry all indicated
the 60-day temporary deviation had improved the flow of highway traffic across the bridge and had a generally favorable
effect on the Town of Beaufort. They also expressed the strong opinion that reverting to the existing published regulation
upon expiration of the temporary deviation would have a detrimental effect on the flow of highway traffic across the
bridge and would be extremely confusing to both motorists and boaters.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is a not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the U.S. Coast Guard must consider the economic impact
on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' include
independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify
as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule does not require
a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the regulatory flexibility requirements.
Although exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed this rule for potential impact on small entities.
Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that
your business qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business,
please submit a comment (See 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will economically affect
your business.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.).


Federalism Assessment


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.(32)(e)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document extends tolerances for the combined residues of the synthetic pyrethroid tefluthrin [2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methylphenyl)methyl)-(1

)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2- dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural
commodities corn, grain, field, and pop; corn, forage and fodder, field and pop. Zeneca Ag Products (previously,
ICI Americas, Inc.) requested this regulation to extend the effective date for tolerances for maximum permissible
levels of residues of this insecticide in or on these commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39502), EPA issued a proposed rule to extend to November 15, 1995, tolerances for the combined
residues of the insecticide tefluthrin in or on the commodities corn, grain, field and pop; corn forage and fodder,
field and pop. Because of the lack of certain data, these tolerances for tefluthrin had been established with an expiration
date of July 31, 1994, by a rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5080). 


On October 20 and November 13, 1992, Zeneca Ag Products requested an extension of the conditional registration and
extension of time to November 15, 1994. Zenaca also requested a waiver of the mesocosm study because of a change in Agency
policy on the need for higher tiered fate and ecological effects data such as an aquatic field study. The Agency reexamined
the existing ecological effects database and concluded that it had sufficient baseline data to characterize aquatic
hazard for this pesticide, and the Agency waived the requirement for a mesocosm study. However, the Agency still concluded
that this pesticide may pose aquatic risk from use on corn and agreed to an extension of the conditional registration
until November 15, 1994, provided Zeneca submits risk reduction measures designed to reduce the potential for exposure
to aquatic habitats of concern. Zeneca Ag Products agreed to these terms, and on June 14, 1993, the Agency extended
the conditional registration for tefluthrin on corn to November 15, 1994. By November 15, 1994, the Agency intends
to complete review of all data and other information submitted and to make Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA) section 3(c)(5) or other appropriate regulatory decisions for corn use of tefluthrin. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance extension will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance extension is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.

Pesticide Tolerances for Avermectin B

1

 and its Delta-8,9-Isomer; Renewal of Time-Limited Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document renews time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide avermectin B

1

 and its delta-8,9-isomer in or on certain raw agricultural commodities and food and feed commodities. Merck &
Co., Inc., requested this regulation to renew tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues of the insecticide
in or on the commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39505), EPA issued proposed rules to renew time-limited tolerances, to expire on April 30,
1996, for the insecticide avermectin B

1

 and its delta 8,9-isomer in or on various raw agricultural commodities under 40 CFR 180.449, food commodities under
40 CFR 185.300, and feed commodities under 40 CFR 186.300 to be consistent with conditional registrations granted
to Merck & Co., Inc., for the insecticide.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerances will protect
the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Medicare Program; Medicare Coverage of Screening Mammography 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises interim final regulations 
on Medicare coverage of screening mammography that were 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 31, 1990 
(55 FR 53510). Those regulations implemented section 4163 
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, setting 
forth payment limitations and conditions for coverage of 
screening mammography. The conditions consist of quality 
standards to ensure the safety and accuracy of screening 
mammography services performed by qualified physicians and 
other suppliers of these services. 



As a result of the implementation of the Mammography 
Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA) by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), we are conforming the conditions for 
coverage to the applicable FDA certification requirements 
that all Medicare suppliers of services must meet effective 
October 1, 1994. The revisions in this final rule also 
respond to certain comments we received on the interim final 
rule published on December 31, 1990; they provide 
clarification of certain of its provisions; and they 
establish conditions for coverage of diagnostic mammography 
that are similar to those we have established for screening 
mammography. In addition, this final rule reflects changes 
resulting from the final rule on the fee schedule for 
physicians' services, which was published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63626).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On December 31, 1990, we published interim final 
regulations concerning Medicare coverage of screening 
mammography in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 53510). These 
regulations implemented section 4163 of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90) (Public Law 101-508), 
which was enacted on November 5, 1990. Section 4163 amended 
sections 1833, 1834, 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1865, 1902, and 
1915 of the Social Security Act (the Act) to provide 
coverage of screening mammography (including a physician's 
interpretation of the images or films produced by the 
radiologic procedure) effective January 1, 1991, subject to 
frequency limitations, quality standards, and special 
payment rules. 

Before we could follow up on the interim final rule and 
publish a final rule on Medicare coverage of screening 
mammography, the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 
(MQSA) (Public Law 101-539) was enacted on October 27, 1992, 
establishing new national quality standards for all 
mammography services. The MQSA amended part F of title III 
of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) 
(42 U.S.C. 263b) to establish a comprehensive statutory 
mechanism for certification and inspection of all 
mammography facilities in the United States, except 
facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The 
authority to implement the provisions of the MQSA was 
delegated by the Secretary to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), which published interim final 
regulations in this regard in the 

Federal Register

 
(58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565) on December 21, 1993, with an 
effective date of February 22, 1994. 

The MQSA did not explicitly repeal section 1834(c) of 
the Act, which contains the provisions governing Medicare 
standards for screening mammography. Furthermore, 
conforming provisions that would tie Medicare coverage for 
both screening and diagnostic mammography to MQSA standards 
were initially included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1993 by the House of Representatives, but 
subsequently had to be dropped along with other nonbudget 
provisions in response to Senate procedural rules. These 
provisions were included again in a technical corrections bill that the Congress attempted to pass late in 
1993, but did not pass for reasons unrelated to the 
substance of the bill. 

The MQSA, however, as it was enacted, specifically 
provides that the standards under the PHS Act apply to all 
facilities in the country furnishing mammography, except VA 
facilities. Thus section 354(b) of the PHS Act, added by 
the MQSA, states that ``No facility may conduct an 
examination or procedure * * * involving mammography * * * unless 
the facility obtains * * * a certificate issued * * * by the 
Secretary.'' Similarly, the MQSA defines a facility in the 
broadest terms: It includes ``a hospital, outpatient 
department, clinic, radiology practice, or mobile unit, an 
office of a physician, or other facility * * * that conducts 
breast cancer screening or diagnosis through mammography 
activities.'' 

The plain language of the PHS Act requires that 
facilities furnishing mammography to Medicare beneficiaries 
meet the standards promulgated under the MQSA. Moreover, we 
believe that the language of the law indicates that the 
Congress intended that all facilities furnishing mammography 
meet a consistent set of national standards. When the 
Congress wished to exclude facilities from these standards, 
it did so explicitly; thus, VA facilities are specifically 
not subject to the Federal standards under the MQSA. 
Finally, we have compared the requirements contained in the 
MQSA and quality standards in section 1834(c) of the Act and 
believe that the Medicare requirements are substantially 
subsumed in the PHS Act. For the reasons stated above, we 
believe that it was the Congress' intent that facilities 
have to meet only one set of Federal mammography standards 
and that the MQSA standards supersede the previous Medicare 
standards. 



II. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule 



The interim final rule, published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510), implemented 
section 4163 of OBRA '90 by setting forth Medicare payment 
limitations and establishing conditions for coverage of 
screening mammography to ensure the safety and accuracy of 
the screening process.

III. Discussion of Public Comments 



We received 42 timely items of correspondence in 
response to the December 31, 1990 interim final rule. The 
comments were from professional organizations, State 
governments, hospitals, consumer organizations, suppliers of 
mammography equipment, and individual practitioners. 

Of these 42 items, 30 of them dealt exclusively with 
the quality standards described in 42 CFR part 494, 
subpart B, and only 12 of them offered any comments on the 
other provisions of the interim regulations relating to the 
payment, coverage frequency, and other provisions. Since we 
are deleting the quality standards in subpart B and are 
replacing them with a cross-reference to the applicable FDA 
requirements, as discussed in section IV. of this preamble, 
it is no longer necessary to respond in this rule to the 
comments that were received on those standards. The other 
comments and our responses to those comments, however, are 
discussed below. 



A. Payment Limitations 





Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the allocation 
between the professional and technical components for the 
screening mammogram should be the same as for a diagnostic 
mammogram. 



Response:

 In the interim final rule (55 FR 53512), we 
used the same allocation between the two components of a 
screening mammogram that we had in place under the Medicare 
radiologist fee schedule for diagnostic mammograms because 
it was the best information we had available at the time and 
because of the lack of a persuasive argument that there 
should be different allocations for the two types of 
mammograms. In this final rule, we are changing the 
apportionment between the professional component and the 
technical component, effective for services furnished 
beginning January 1, 1995, to reflect the relationship 
between the relative value units established for a 
diagnostic bilateral mammogram under the fee schedule for 
physicians' services for the year in question. We will not 
include the percentages for the professional component and 
the technical component in this final rule because the 
specificity requires a time-consuming rulemaking process 
when we modify the apportionment. We will announce the 
apportionment of the payment limits between the two 
components for 1995, and each year thereafter, at the same 
time as we announce the statutory payment limit in effect 
for that year. At this time, we anticipate that the 
apportionment of the payment limit in 1995 will be 
32 percent professional component and 68 percent technical 
component. 



Comment:

 One commenter objected to the discussion in 
the preamble of the interim final rule (55 FR 53513) of the 
difficulty rural hospitals have in furnishing the technical 
component of a screening mammogram within the payment limit 
because the rural hospitals may have a low volume of 
services. The commenter believed that, if a hospital and a 
radiologist entered into an agreement stating that the 
radiologist would accept a lower amount for the 
interpretation than Medicare would pay the radiologist 
directly for the interpretation, the agreement would 
constitute a ``kickback'' of a portion of the radiologist's 
fee to the hospital.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 We acknowledge that this agreement could 
constitute a kickback under the Medicare and Medicaid 
anti-kickback statute (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)). That statute 
makes it a felony to offer, pay, solicit, or receive 
remuneration with the intention of inducing the referral of 
Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant, or Social Services Block Grant program business. 
Activities that come within the purview of the statute are 
not subject to prosecution if they fit within specified safe 
harbors, as set forth in the regulation published in the 


Federal Register

 July 29, 1991 (56 FR 35952). Consequently, 
an organization or individual should enter into an agreement 
such as that referenced in the December 1990 interim final 
rule only if the agreement does not violate the 
anti-kickback statute. 



Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that the rule 
should be modified so that a portion of the professional 
component of a screening mammogram be determined to 
represent the contribution of the primary care physician if 
the screening mammogram is taken in the primary care 
physician's office but interpreted by another physician. 
The commenters believed that the allocation of 37 percent of 
the payment limit to the interpreting physician's role 
overcompensates that physician and ignores the primary care 
physician's role in furnishing the mammogram. One commenter 
stated that the Physician Payment Reform Commission report 
entitled ``The Costs of Providing Screening Mammography'' 
allocates a flat $12 for the interpretation. As an 
alternative, the commenter suggested that the primary care 
physician be permitted to contract with the interpreting 
physician for payment at a rate less than 37 percent of the 
payment limit. Another commenter recommended that the 
interpretation represent 20 percent of the total fee. 



Response:

 Medicare does not pay for referrals, and 
exacting a fee for referrals is against the law. A 
qualified physician who furnishes the interpretation of the 
screening mammogram receives payment for the professional 
component of the screening mammogram. If the primary care 
physician furnishes neither the professional component nor 
the technical component of the screening mammogram, he or 
she is entitled to no payment for the screening mammogram. 

The apportionment of the screening mammography payment 
limit between the professional component and the technical 
component will reflect the payment split for the 
corresponding components for diagnostic mammography under 
the fee schedule for physicians' services. The weights of 
the factors reflect historical payment data, and we have no 
reason to believe that the apportionment is not appropriate 
for a screening mammography procedure. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the purchased 
service limitation set forth in section 1842(n) of the Act 
should not apply to the technical component of a screening 
mammography procedure furnished in a primary care 
physician's office that customarily uses a temporary or 
leased technologist because_

 The technologist is under the direct control and 
supervision of the primary care physician and, as such, 
meets the common law rules for an employer/employee 
relationship applied under the Internal Revenue Code; and 

 The screening mammography procedure is performed under 
the supervision of the primary care physician in conformance 
with the definition of ``direct supervision'' set forth in 
 410.32(a). 



Response:

 The purchased service limitation does not 
apply to screening mammography services because the 
procedures are not included in the definition of diagnostic 
tests under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act, as required by 
section 1842(n) of the Act, the statutory basis of the 
purchased service limitation. Section 1861(s)(13) of the 
Act provides for Part B coverage of screening mammography 
services, which are not subject to the requirements of 
section 1842(n) of the Act.

Comment:

 Two commenters stated that a ``screening 
mammogram'' is no different from a ``diagnostic mammogram'' and 
therefore should be paid at the same level. 



Response:

 A screening mammogram and a diagnostic 
mammogram are similar in many respects, but the purposes of 
the two tests are distinctly different. A screening 
mammogram is a routine medical check; a diagnostic mammogram 
is made to diagnose a specific complaint or medical problem 
already identified by the patient or her attending 
physician. Section 1834(c)(4)(A) of the Act clearly 
establishes a $55 overall limit applicable to a screening 
mammography procedure in 1991 with increases in subsequent 
years limited to the percentage increase in the Medicare 
Economic Index for the subsequent year. Section 
1834(b)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of the 
Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to 
reduce this limit, after appropriate review, but does not 
authorize the Secretary to raise the limit. If we decide to 
establish the same payment for the two procedures, we might 
have to lower the payments for most diagnostic mammograms. 



Comment:

 Two commenters recommended that the interim 
final rule be amended to waive the beneficiary's copayment 
liabilities so that older women will not have to bear out-of-pocket costs for the screening mammography procedure.




Response:

 A waiver of copayment liabilities would have 
to be authorized by the Congress. Section 1834(c)(1)(C) of 
the Act specifically limits Medicare payments to 80 percent 
of the least of the actual charge, the radiologist fee 
schedule or the physicians' fee schedule established under 
section 1848 of the Act as applicable, or the statutory 
limit for the service. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that insufficient 
payment levels should not be a deterrent to women having 
access to screening mammography services and that the 
relationship between current charges, payment levels, and 
access to the service should be taken into consideration in 
determining payment levels. 



Response:

 We have to apply the overall payment limit 
established in section 1834(c)(4) of the Act. There is no 
provision for exceptions to ensure access to these services 
in special circumstances. 



Comment:

 One commenter believed that it is critical 
that any changes to the Medicare Part B payment system not 
be counter to physician payment reform. The existence of an 
overall national payment limit concerned another commenter 
who believed that the limit is inconsistent with the premise 
of a resource-based relative value scale payment schedule 
adjusted for geographic cost variations.

Response:

 Section 1834(c)(1)(C) of the Act requires 
that the amount of payment for screening mammography 
services be equal to 80 percent of the least of the actual 
charge, the radiologist fee schedule, or the physicians' fee 
schedule established under section 1848 of the Act, as 
applicable, or the statutory limit for the service. 


Comment:

 One commenter, while conceding that we had no 
choice under the statute in imposing an overall $55 limit, 
stated that a single national rate without any recognition 
of geographic variations is inappropriate. The commenter 
believed that we should establish a price for screening 
mammograms within the context of other radiology services 
and ask the Congress to repeal the separate limit for these 
procedures. 


Response:

 If it becomes apparent that the statutory 
limit is inadequate, we may make the proposal. 


Comment:

 One commenter stated that radiologists would 
charge $32 for their interpretation, leaving only about $23 
for the hospital, an amount which would cover only the cost 
of the film. 


Response:

 Under the statutory allocation methodology 
implemented in the interim final rule (55 FR 53512), the 
professional component of the procedure in 1991 was limited 
to $20.35 (37 percent of $55), while the technical component 
was limited to $34.63 (63 percent of $55). The 1991 
limiting charges for nonparticipating physicians and 
suppliers were: $68.75 (global), $25.44 (professional 
component), and $43.31 (technical component). Therefore, 
payment to hospitals for the technical component of 
screening mammography services is not determined by 
subtracting the amount billed for the professional component 
charge from the overall limit, but rather on the basis of 
the allocation methodology described in the interim final 
rule (55 FR 53512). 


Comment:

 One commenter stated that the payment limit 
in section 1834(c)(4) of the Act is lower than the costs for 
screening mammography services furnished by a mobile unit in 
rural areas. The commenter believed that the operating 
costs of a mobile unit are higher than those of a stationary 
unit. Another commenter expressed concern that the 
processing of Medicare claims will increase the costs of 
mobile facilities and other screening centers that 
previously have not handled Medicare claims. 


Response:

 Section 1834(c)(4) of the Act does not 
provide for any exception to the overall limit. 
Nonparticipating physicians and suppliers may bill 
beneficiaries higher amounts for the procedure up to the 
limiting charge set forth in  405.535.

B. Limitations on Screening Mammography Services 




Comment:

 One commenter believed that the screening 
mammography radiologic procedure covered under the Medicare 
program should not be limited to the four-view procedure 
specified in  410.34(b)(1) of the interim final rule, but 
that additional views should be allowed as necessary in the 
case of particular patients. 


Response:

 As we indicated in the preamble to the 
interim final rule (55 FR 53513), the basis for specifying 
that the screening mammography service must be a bilateral 
four-view procedure (that is, cranio-caudal and a medial 
lateral oblique view of each breast) is congressional intent 
as expressed in the Report of the Committee of Conference 
that accompanied Public Law No. 100-360 (H.R. Rep. 
No. 100-661, 100th Congress, 2nd Sess. 171 (1988)). In that 
report, the conferees stated that they ``understood that a 
bilateral four-view procedure is currently considered to be 
the standard of care in the United States for screening 
mammography * * * [and] therefore anticipate that this would be 
initially included in the quality standards to be developed 
by the Secretary as a requirement for coverage.'' 
We recognize that it may be necessary in the case of 
some patients to perform more than a bilateral four-view 
procedure. In view of the possibility that more than four 
images will need to be taken in the case of a particular 
patient, we have revised  410.34(b)(1) (redesignated in 
this final rule as  410.34(d)(1)) to state that generally 
``the service must, at a minimum, be a four-view 
exposure * * *.'' The need to do additional images will not 
have any effect on the payment amount that will be allowed 
for the Medicare screening mammography services because the 
payment amount is prescribed by statute. 
To accommodate postmastectomy screening of certain 
women, however, we will allow, at a minimum, a two-view 
exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral 
oblique view) of the remaining breast for those individuals, 
and still permit the facility to meet the standard. We are 
setting that standard as a two-view exposure. 


Comment:

 Several commenters expressed concern about 
the limitations on the frequency of coverage of mammography 
screenings. 


Response:

 As explained in the interim final rule 
(55 FR 53513), the frequency limitations specified in 
 410.34 reflect the provisions imposed by section 
1834(c)(2) of the Act, except for the high risk factors that 
were identified in  410.34(b)(4)(i) (redesignated in this 
final rule as  410.34(d)(4)(i)). As provided in 
section 1834(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the frequency limitations 
may be revised by the Secretary in consultation with the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI). This matter is under 
consideration, and will be addressed in a later notice, as 
appropriate. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that this final rule 
discuss the importance of women having a clinical breast 
examination performed by a physician that would supplement 
the preventive value of using the Medicare screening 
mammography benefit. The commenter acknowledged that 
Medicare law authorizing screening mammography coverage does 
not provide for coverage and payment for a clinical breast 
examination as part of the screening mammography benefit. 
However, the commenter suggested that this final rule, at a 
minimum, indicate that a supplementary clinical breast 
examination performed by a physician be recommended in 
conjunction with a screening mammography examination and 
related physician's interpretation of the results of that 
radiologic examination. 


Response:

 The commenter is correct. We do not have 
the legal authority under the screening mammography benefit 
to provide for coverage and payment for a clinical breast 
examination performed by a physician in conjunction with the 
use of screening mammography services. We understand, 
however, that NCI, ACS, the American Medical Association 
(AMA), the American Society of Internal Medicine, the 
National Medical Association, the American Academy of Family 
Physicians, the American College of Radiology, and other 
specialty groups recommend that a combination of screening 
mammography and a clinical breast examination is necessary 
for a complete early breast cancer detection program. In 
this regard, NCI publishes public information brochures that 
explain screening mammography and strongly advise that a 
doctor also perform a clinical breast examination to 
supplement the value of the screening service. Information 
about breast cancer screening, including information 
regarding the importance of clinical breast examinations, 
can be obtained, free of charge, by calling the NCI-funded 
Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER. 


Comment:

 One commenter questioned the inclusion of 
``not given birth prior to age 30'' as a factor indicating a 
high risk of developing breast cancer.

Response:

 We included ``not given birth prior to 
age 30'' as a factor indicating a high risk of developing 
breast cancer in the interim final rule based upon advice we 
received from NCI, and, in response to the comment, we have 
consulted further with NCI. NCI staff have advised us that 
the relative risk of women who have ``not given birth prior 
to age 30'' developing breast cancer is 1.4; that is, a woman 
who has not given birth prior to age 30 has a 40 percent 
higher chance of developing breast cancer over her lifetime 
than would otherwise be the case. This elevated risk 
applies over the age range of 40 to 49 that is subject to 
the high risk factor provision specified in the Medicare 
statute. Based on the advice of NCI, we have decided to 
retain in this final rule ``not given birth prior to age 30'' 
as a factor indicating a high risk of developing breast 
cancer. 



Comment:

 One commenter believed that there is a need 
to clarify the meaning of the term ``personal history of 
breast cancer'' that is cited in  410.34(b)(4) as one of the 
factors indicating a high risk of developing breast cancer. 
The commenter also requested clarification as to whether a 
biopsy that reveals a lump to be benign is reasonable 
evidence of ``a history of breast cancer.'' 



Response:

 The use of the term ``a personal history of 
breast cancer'' in  410.34(b)(4) of the interim final rule 
was intended to mean that there is documented evidence in 
the woman's medical record that she has tested positive for 
breast cancer. Thus, a woman who has a biopsy of a lump in 
her breast that is determined to be benign would not be 
considered to have ``a history of breast cancer.'' 



Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern that the 
interim final rule made no reference to the possibility that 
the Medicare program may pay for certain medically necessary 
mammograms that are performed more often than the 
frequencies stated in the statute and the interim final rule 
for screening mammograms. The commenter suggested that we 
clarify this. 



Response:

 The commenter is correct that the Medicare 
program may pay for certain medically necessary mammograms 
(also referred to as diagnostic mammograms as distinguished 
from screening mammograms) that are performed more 
frequently than the frequencies stated in the law and the 
interim final rule for screening mammograms. We stated this 
fact in the interim final rule (55 FR 53511). Under this 
policy, mammograms are covered if medically necessary to 
diagnose a specific complaint or medical problem that has 
been identified by the patient or her attending physician, 
including medical problems that may have been identified on 
the basis of a previous screening mammogram. This coverage 
is based on sections 1861(s)(1) and (s)(3) of the Act, which 
provide for Medicare coverage of interpretation of 
diagnostic X-ray tests by a physician. 



Comment:

 Three commenters observed that a diagnostic 
mammogram requires essentially the same level of 
professional attention and professional expertise as does a 
screening mammogram, and one of these commenters suggested 
that similar quality standards be applied to both types of 
mammography services under the Medicare program. 



Response:

 We agree. As we noted in response to a 
previous comment, a diagnostic mammogram and a screening 
mammogram are similar in many respects, and the Congress 
recognized this fact when it enacted the MQSA, which 
authorized the application of quality standards to both 
types of mammograms, effective October 1, 1994. Accordingly, we are including a condition for coverage in 
this rule at  410.34(b)(2) that, in order to qualify for 
payment for diagnostic mammograms under the Medicare 
program, suppliers of these services must meet the same FDA 
certification requirements that we are adopting in this 
final rule for screening mammograms. (These certification 
requirements are set forth in section 354 of the PHS Act, 
implemented by 21 CFR part 900, subpart B.)

IV. Provisions of the Final Rule 



In this final rule, we are deleting the conditions for 
coverage specified in 42 CFR part 494, subpart B, which 
screening mammography suppliers must meet to qualify for 
coverage of the services under the Medicare program. 
Instead, we are cross-referencing the applicable FDA 
certification requirements, published in the Federal 
Register on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565), 
that suppliers of the services must meet effective 
October 1, 1994. 

Based on our analysis of section 354 of the PHS Act, as 
added by the MQSA, and the related FDA interim regulations, 
we believe that we have fulfilled our responsibility to 
establish quality standards under section 1834(c)(3) of the 
Act by adopting the quality standards and related 
certification requirements specified in the FDA regulations. 

Section 1834(c)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
establish standards to ensure the safety and accuracy of 
screening mammography services performed under Medicare 
Part B. The quality standards that must be established 
include: (1) Standards that require the use of equipment 
specifically designed for mammography and that meet other 
radiological standards established by the Secretary for 
mammography; (2) standards that require that the mammography 
be performed by individuals who are licensed by a State to 
perform radiological procedures, or who are certified as 
qualified to perform radiological procedures by an 
appropriate program as the Secretary specifies in 
regulations; (3) standards that require that the results of 
the mammography be interpreted by a physician who is 
certified as qualified to interpret radiological procedures 
by such an appropriate board (or program) as the Secretary 
recognizes in regulations; and (4) requirements that, with 
respect to a woman's first screening mammography performed 
for which payment is made under the program, the results of 
the mammography will be placed in the woman's permanent 
medical records. 

In the FDA interim final rule, 21 CFR subpart B, 
 900.11 (``Requirements for certification''), paragraph (a) 
provides that after October 1, 1994, ``a certificate issued 
by FDA will be required for lawful operation of all 
facilities'' and that in order to obtain a certificate from 
FDA, facilities ``are required to meet the quality standards 
in  900.12 and to be accredited by an accrediting body 
approved by FDA'' as described in 21 CFR part 900, subpart A, 
  900.1 through 900.7. In  900.12 of the interim final 
rule, FDA established standards for mammography equipment, 
personnel, and practices. These standards are substantially 
the same as the Medicare interim quality standards that were 
published on December 31, 1990, but when they do differ from 
the existing Medicare standards, they still appear to be 
consistent with our mandate under section 1834(c)(3) of the 
Act. Thus, this final rule will remove the existing 
Medicare interim quality standards and, instead, will cross-refer to applicable interim FDA certification requirements

for mammography services. 

In addition, we are making several technical and other 
clarifying revisions in the remaining provisions of the 
existing interim regulations that we published in the 


Federal Register

 on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510). With 
the exception of two points of clarification, a technical 
change, and certain conforming changes to part 405, 
subpart E (``Criteria for Determination of Reasonable 
Charges; Payment for Services of Hospital Interns, 
Residents, and Supervising Physicians''), the rationale for 
these revisions is discussed in the ``Discussion of Public 
Comments'' in section III. of this rule. 

In  405.534 (``Limitation on payment for screening 
mammography services''), we are making technical changes to 
cross-refer to the fee schedule for physicians' services. 
The current  405.534 refers to  405.533. The latter was 
removed from the CFR on November 25, 1991, with the 
publication of the fee schedule for physicians' services in 
the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 59622). We are also revising 
paragraphs (c) and (d) so that, effective for a screening 
mammography procedure furnished beginning January 1, 1995, 
the payment for the screening mammography procedure reflects 
the relationship between the relative value units for the 
professional and technical components established for a 
diagnostic mammography procedure under the physicians' fee 
schedule. Effective January 1, 1995, the apportionment of 
the payment limit between the professional and technical 
components will be changed to reflect the relationship of 
the two components for diagnostic bilateral mammograms under 
the fee schedule for physicians' services for 1995.

We are revising the title of  405.535 to add the words 
``and suppliers.'' It will read, ``Special rules for 
nonparticipating physicians and suppliers furnishing 
screening mammography services.'' We are also making 
technical changes in this section to cross-refer the reader 
to the fee schedule for physicians' services. Additionally, 
we are setting forth in  405.535 requirements for the 
limiting charge if the screening mammography services are 
furnished by a nonparticipating physician or supplier who 
does not accept assignment. 



Conditions for Coverage 



In accordance with section 354 of the PHS Act, 
regarding coverage conditions for diagnostic and screening 
mammography, we are amending 42 CFR by revising  410.34(a) 
to specify definitions of the terms (1) ``diagnostic 
mammography,'' (2) ``screening mammography,'' (3) ``supplier of 
diagnostic mammography,'' (4) ``supplier of screening 
mammography,'' (5) ``certificate,'' (6) ``provisional 
certificate,'' and (7) ``meets the certification requirements 
of section 354 of the Public Health Services (PHS) Act.'' 

In  410.34, we are redesignating paragraph (b) as 
paragraph (d). We are adding a heading to paragraph (d), 
``Limitations on coverage of screening mammography services.'' 
In newly redesignated paragraph (d)(1) of  410.34, we are 
clarifying that the current requirement that a mammogram 
``must, 

at a minimum 

[emphasis added], be a four-view 
exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral 
oblique view of each breast)'' is the minimum requirement 
that must be met, except in the case of a woman who is 
having a postmastectomy screening, when we will allow a 
two-view exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial 
lateral oblique view) of the remaining breast. 

We are adding a new paragraph (b) to  410.34 to set 
forth conditions for coverage of diagnostic mammography, 
which essentially cross-reference the same FDA certification 
requirements that suppliers of screening mammography must 
meet on October 1, 1994. Medicare Part B pays for 
diagnostic mammography services if the diagnostic 
mammography services are ordered by a doctor of medicine or 
osteopathy and if they are furnished by a supplier of 
diagnostic mammography services that meets the certification 
requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in 
21 CFR part 900 (``Mammography''), subpart B (``Quality 
Standards and Certification''). 

We are also adding a new paragraph (c) to  410.34 to 
set forth the conditions for payment of screening 
mammography. Medicare Part B pays for screening mammography 
services only if they are furnished by a supplier of 
screening mammography services that meets the certification 
requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in 
21 CFR part 900, subpart B. 

We are revising  411.15 (``Particular services excluded 
from coverage'') to replace the cross reference to subpart B 
of part 494 (which is being removed and reserved) with a 
reference to the certification requirements in section 354 
of the PHS Act, as set forth in 21 CFR part 900, subpart B. 

The current  413.123(b) states that payment to 
hospitals for screening mammography services performed on an 
outpatient basis is determined in accordance with 
 405.534(c). We are changing this to refer to  405.534(d) 
to correct an error. 



V. Information Collection Requirements 



Due to the enactment of the MQSA and its implementation 
by FDA, we are requesting cancellation of the information 
collection requirements approved under OMB control 
number 0938-0608 for Medicare coverage of screening 
mammograms, effective October 1, 1994. The latter 
information collection document was previously required as a 
result of the enactment of section 4163 of OBRA '90. 

In implementing section 4163 of OBRA '90, we published 
interim final regulations on December 31, 1990 
(55 FR 53510), including certain minimum safety and accuracy 
standards set forth in 42 CFR subpart B, which suppliers of 
screening mammography services had to meet in order to 
participate under Medicare, effective January 1, 1991. With 
the enactment of the MQSA, however, all mammography 
facilities in the United States, except for VA facilities, 
will be required, effective October 1, 1994, to have a 
certificate issued by FDA regardless of their source of 
payment. Therefore, under its delegation of authority from 
the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, FDA will replace HCFA on October 1, 1994, as the 
Federal agency responsible for surveying and certifying 
suppliers of screening mammography services in accordance 
with the new MQSA standards. 



VI. Delay in the Effective Date 



As required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 
we generally provide for final rules not to be effective 
until 30 days after the date of publication unless we find 
good cause to waive the delay. As a result of the 
implementation of the MQSA by FDA, we are conforming the 
conditions for Medicare coverage of screening mammography 
services to the applicable FDA certification requirements, 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 21, 1993 (58 
FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565), that all Medicare suppliers of 
services must meet effective October 1, 1994. We view the 
changes made by this rule as merely interpretative. The APA 
does not require that there be a delayed effective date for 
an interpretative rule. Accordingly, this rule will be 
effective October 1, 1994, the effective date of the FDA 
requirements on mammography services.

VII. Regulatory Impact Analysis 



A. Introduction 



Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the 
RFA, all physicians and suppliers of screening mammography 
services and equipment are considered to be small entities. 

This final rule revises interim regulations on Medicare 
coverage of screening mammography that were published in the 


Federal Register

 on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510). Those 
regulations implemented section 4163 of OBRA '90, setting 
conditions for coverage for and limitations on screening 
mammography. 

In the interim final rule, we presented an analysis of 
the various effects that the screening mammography benefit 
would have on beneficiaries, physicians, and suppliers 
(55 FR 53518). We received no comments on the impact 
analysis. Below, we present revised estimates of projected 
Medicare costs and utilization rates and the effects, as far 
as they can be foreseen, of the changes we have adopted as a 
result of public comment. Our estimates of projected 
additional costs and services are lower than those we 
anticipated when the interim final rule was published in the 


Federal Register

. One explanation for lower than 
anticipated costs and services for this service may be that 
physicians have been furnishing screening mammography 
services but have been billing for the services using the 
CPT code for diagnostic mammography. 

We anticipate that Medicare coverage of screening 
mammography services will result in the following costs: 









Beginning October 1, 1994, FDA replaces HCFA as the 
Federal agency responsible for surveying and certifying 
suppliers of all mammography services, both diagnostic and 
screening. Beginning on that date, all facilities 
furnishing mammography services will be expected to meet 
only one set of national standards. This provision should 
benefit mammography facilities and help ensure the safety 
and accuracy of screening mammography services performed 
under Medicare Part B. The Medicare program will no longer 
be responsible for funding this cost. 

In accordance with the provisions of Executive 
Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. 



B. Rural Hospital Impact Statement 



Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number 
of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the 
provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of 
section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We do not 
believe small rural hospitals will be required to make any 
operational changes to comply with this final rule. 
Therefore, we are not preparing a rural impact analysis 
because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, 
that this final rule will not have a significant impact on 
the operations of a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals.

Medicare Program; Qualified Health Maintenance Organizations: Technical Amendments 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule with comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule clarifies and updates portions of the HCFA regulations that pertain to Federal qualification and continued
regulation of health maintenance organizations (HMOs), inclusion of qualified HMOs in employee health benefits
plans, and the administration of outstanding loans and loan guarantees that were awarded before October 1, 1986,
under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This rule is part of a special project to clarify and update all of 42 CFR
part 417, which contains the regulations applicable to all entities that provide prepaid health care, that is, HMOs,
CMPs (competitive medical plans) and HCPPs (health care prepayment plans). 



These are technical and editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the regulations. They are intended to
make it easier to find particular provisions, to provide overviews of the different program aspects, and to better
ensure uniform understanding of the rules. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



This rule revises subparts D, E, F, and V of part 417 of the HCFA rules as part of the special project noted in the 

SUMMARY.

 

The first two steps in the project to clarify and update part 417 were the publication of two final rules identified
as OCC-22-F and OCC-15-FC. The first was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 17, 1991, at 56 FR 51984; the second, on July 15, 1993, at 58 FR 38062.

The regulation identified as OCC-22-F_

 Removed most of the outdated content; 

 Redesignated certain portions of part 417 to free section numbers needed so that new rules can be incorporated
in logical order; and  Designated the remaining text under subpart headings that identify the different program
aspects so that it is easier to refer to those aspects and to find particular rules. 
The second regulation, identified as OCC-15-F_

 Through nomenclature and definition changes, established certain terms to be used throughout part 417 with
the aim of avoiding confusion, making clear that responsibility for the prepaid health care programs has been delegated
to HCFA, and ensuring use of the most precise terms available. 
 Established a separate subpart C with four sections to set forth the many requirements that apply to the organization
and operation of HMOs, and that were previously compressed into a single section ( 417.107). 

As a result of the redesignations made by OCC-22-F and OCC-15-FC,   417.107 through
417.119 are now available for new rules that are required because of statutory amendments that affect the furnishing
of services by qualified HMOs or may be needed because of future changes in the statute. 



B. Changes in the Regulations 



In order to clarify and update subparts D, E, F, and V, this rule makes the following changes:  Uses terminology
established by OCC-15-FC or that 
reflects accepted usage in all HCFA regulations.

<TEXT>
 

 Revises long unbroken columns of text to designate separate provisions and to provide headings that help the
reader to get an overview and to find particular provisions. 

 Uses the active voice and the present indicative (rather than the future tense) to describe what HCFA or its
employees, agents, or contractors do, and uses the most precise terms available. 

A specific goal is to complete the separation of the rules that pertain to assurances required of entities applying
for Federal qualification from those that pertain to assurances given in applying for financial assistance (grants,
loans, and loan guarantees) that was available under the PHS Act before October 1986. To achieve this goal, we have_

 Removed the portion of  417.160 applicable to financial assistance that is no longer available; and


 Added a new  417.940 in subpart V to reference  417.163(g) as applicable to entities that have outstanding
loans or loan guarantees, and that fail to comply with assurances they gave in applying for the loan or loan guarantee.
(Section 417.163(g) provides that HCFA may bring civil action to enforce compliance with assurances.) 

In addition, we have_

 Removed the definitions of the three types of ``qualified'' HMOs ( 417.141) because definitions are
not used for substantive content, and in this case simply constituted a partial duplication of the rules themselves;


 Incorporated paragraph (a) of  417.143 into  417.140 to set forth the scope of the whole subpart
D; and 

 Removed   417.168 and 417.169 from subpart F because their content is being transferred to  417.142(g)
and (h). 



Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



With one exception, the changes made by this rule are technical and editorial in nature. Their aim is to simplify, clarify,
and update subparts D, E, F, and V without substantive change. 

We have removed from  417.169 (now redesignated as  417.142(h)), the words ``for purposes of receiving
assistance under this subpart.'' HCFA has consistently interpreted this language (which appears in section 1307(d)
of the PHS Act) as applying to continued qualification of HMOs as well as to initial applications for assistance that
was available under that Act before October 1986. This interpretation avoids what would be an unintended result:
Now that the assistance is no longer available, HMOs that had qualified in connection with their requests for assistance
would have to disenroll their Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) enrollees in order to retain qualification
and to be able to take advantage of the requirement that employers include qualified HMOs in their employee health
benefits plans. It was a mistake to include in  417.169 the limiting language, which did not appear in the predecessor
rule issued in 1974. We have deleted the language to achieve consistency between paragraphs (g) and (h) of  417.142
and with HCFA's long-standing interpretation of the statute. 

Given this justification, we find that there is good cause to waive proposed rule-making procedures as unnecessary.
As previously indicated, however, we will consider timely comments from anyone who questions the deletion of the
reference to ``assistance'' or believes that, in making the technical and editorial changes, we have altered the
substance of the rules. Although we cannot respond to comments individually, if we revise these rules as a result of
comments, we will discuss all timely comments in the preamble to the revised rules. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



These regulations contain no new information collection requirements subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 



Regulatory Impact Statement 



Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, we prepare a
regulatory flexibility analysis for each rule, unless the Secretary certifies that the particular rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, or a significant impact on the operation
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 

We have not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,
that these rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities or on the operation of
a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Access may not be more restrictive or less favorable than the access the employing entity provides to other offerors
of options included in the health benefits plan, whether or not those offerors elect to avail themselves of that access.


(b) 

Review of HMO offering materials.

 (1) The HMO must give the employing entity or designee opportunity to review, revise, and approve HMO educational
and offering materials before distribution. 

(2) Revisions must be limited to correcting factual errors and misleading or ambiguous statements, unless_

(i) The HMO and the employing entity agree otherwise; or 

(ii) Other revisions are required by law. 

(3) The employing entity or designee must complete revision of the materials promptly so as not to delay or otherwise
interfere with their use during the group enrollment period. 

(c) 

Group enrollment period; prohibition of restrictions; effective date of HMO coverage

_(1) 

Prohibition of restrictions.

 If an employing entity or designee includes the option of enrollment in a qualified HMO in the health benefits plan
offered to its eligible employees, it must provide a group enrollment period before the effective date of HMO coverage.
The employing entity may not impose waiting periods as a condition of enrollment in the HMO or of transfer from HMO to
non-HMO coverage, or exclusions, or limitations based on health status. 

(2) 

Effective date of coverage.

 Unless otherwise agreed to by the employing entity, or designee, and the HMO, coverage under the HMO contract for employees
selecting the HMO option begins on the day the non-HMO contract expires or is renewed without lapse. 

(3) 

Coordination of benefits.

 Nothing in this subpart precludes the uniform application of coordination of benefits agreements between the HMOs
and the other carriers that are included in the health benefits plan. 

(d) 

Continued eligibility for ``free-standing'' health benefits

_(1) 

Basic requirement.

 At the request of a qualified HMO, the employing entity or its designee must provide that employees selecting the option
of HMO membership will not, because of this selection, lose their eligibility for free-standing dental, optical,
or prescription drug benefits for which they were previously eligible or would be eligible if selecting a non-HMO
option and that are not included in the services provided by the HMO to its enrollees as part of the HMO prepaid benefit
package. 

(2) 

``Free-standing'' defined.

 For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``free-standing'' refers to a benefit which_

(i) Is not integrated or incorporated into a basic health benefits package or major medical plan, and 

(ii) Is_

(A) Offered by a carrier other than the one offering the basic health benefits package or major medical plan; or 

(B) Subject to a premium separate from the premium for the basic health benefits package or major medical plan. 

(3) 

Examples of the employing entity's obligation with respect to the continued eligibility.

 (i) The health benefits plan includes a free-standing dental benefit. The HMO does not offer any dental coverage as
part of its health services provided to members on a prepaid basis. The employing entity must provide that employees
who select the HMO option continue to be eligible for dental coverage. (If the dental coverage is not optional for employees
selecting the non-HMO option, nothing in this regulation requires that the coverage be made optional for employees
selecting the HMO option. Conversely, if this coverage is optional for employees selecting the non-HMO option, nothing
in this regulation requires that the coverage be mandatory for employees selecting the non-HMO option.)

(ii) The non-HMO option provides free-standing coverage 
for optical services (such as refraction and the provision 
of eyeglasses), and the HMO does not. The employing entity 
must provide that employees who select the HMO option 
continue to be eligible for optical coverage. 

(iii) The non-HMO option includes dental coverage in its 
major medical package, with a common deductible applied to 
dental as well as non-dental benefits. The HMO provides no 
dental coverage as part of its pre-paid health services. 
Because the dental coverage is not free-standing, the 
employing entity is not required to provide that employees 
who select the HMO option continue to be eligible for dental 
coverage, but is free to do so. 

(e) 

Opportunity to select among coverage options: 
Requirement for affirmative written 
selection

_(1) 

Opportunity other than during a group 
enrollment period.

 The employing entity or designee must 
provide opportunity (in addition to the group enrollment 
period) for selection among coverage options, by eligible 
employees who meet any of the following conditions: 

(i) Are new employees. 

(ii) Have been transferred or have changed their place 
of residence, resulting in_

(A) Eligibility for enrollment in a qualified HMO for 
which they were not previously eligible by place of 
residence; or 

(B) Residence outside the service area of a qualified 
HMO in which they were previously enrolled. 

(iii) Are covered by any coverage option that ceases 
operation. 

(2) 

Prohibition of restrictions.

 When the employees 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are eligible 
to participate in the health benefits plan, the employing 
entity or designee must make available, without waiting 
periods or exclusions based on health status as a condition, 
the opportunity to enroll in an HMO, or transfer from HMO 
coverage to non-HMO coverage. 

(3) 

Affirmative written selection.

 The employing 
entity or designee must require that the eligible employee 
make an affirmative written selection in any of the 
following circumstances: 

(i) Enrollment in a particular qualified HMO is 
offered for the first time. 

(ii) The eligible employee elects to change from one 
option to another. 

(iii) The eligible employee is one of those specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. 

(f) 

Determination of copayment levels and supplemental 
health services.

 The selection of a copayment level and of 
supplemental health services to be contracted for must be 
made as follows: 

(1) For employees represented by a collective 
bargaining representative, the selection of copayment levels 
and supplemental health services is subject to the 
collective bargaining process. 

(2) For employees not represented by a bargaining 
representative, the selection of copayment levels and 
supplemental health services is subject to the same 
decisionmaking process used by the employing entity with 
respect to the non-HMO option in its health benefits plan. 

(3) In all cases, the HMO has the right to include, 
with the basic benefits package it provides to its enrollees 
for a basic health services payment, on a non-negotiable 
basis, those supplemental health services that meet the 
following conditions: 

(i) Are required to be offered under State law. 

(ii) Are included uniformly by the HMO in its prepaid 
benefit package. 

(iii) Are available to employees who select the non-HMO 
option but not available to those who select the HMO option.

that_

(a) Were awarded to them before October 1986 under section 1304 or section 1305 of the PHS Act; and

4. Sections 417.934 and 417.937 are revised to read as follows:



 417.934

 Reserve requirement.



(a) 

Timing.

 Unless the Secretary approved a longer period, an entity that received a loan or loan guarantee under section 1305
of the PHS Act was required to establish a restricted reserve account on the earlier of the following:

(1) When the HMO's revenues and costs of operation reached the break-even point.

(2) At the end of the 60-month period following the Secretary's endorsement of the loan or loan guarantee.

(b) 

Purpose and amount of reserve.

 The reserve had to be constituted so as to accumulate, no later than 12 years after endorsement of the loan or loan guarantee,
an amount equal to 1 year's principal and interest.



 417.937

 Loan and loan guarantee provisions.



(a) 

Disbursement of loan proceeds.

 The principal amount of any loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary under this subpart was disbursed to the entity
in accordance with an agreement entered into between the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.

(b) 

Length and maturity of loans.

 The principal amount of each loan or loan guarantee, together with interest thereon, is repayable over a period of
22 years, beginning on the date of endorsement of the loan, or loan guarantee by the Secretary. The Secretary could
approve a shorter repayment period if he or she determined that a repayment period of less than 22 years is more appropriate
to an entity's total financial plan.

(c) 

Repayment.

 The principal amount of each loan or loan guarantee, together with interest thereon is repayable in accordance with
a repayment schedule that is agreed upon by the parties to the loan or loan guarantee and approved by the Secretary before
or at the time of endorsement of the loan. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Secretary, each loan made
or guaranteed by the Secretary is repayable in substantially level combined installments of principal and interest
to be paid at intervals not less frequently than annually, sufficient in amount to amortize the loan through the final
year of the life of the loan. Principal repayment during the first 60 months of operation could be deferred with payment
of interest only during that period. The Secretary could set rates of interest for each disbursement at a rate comparable
to the rate of interest prevailing on the date of disbursement for marketable obligations of the United States of comparable
maturities, adjusted to provide for appropriate administrative charges.

Documentation of Vessels



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending its vessel documentation regulations. The amendments clarify the vessel documentation
regulations by restating the citizenship requirements for trusts to reflect the Coast Guard's policy; by correcting
an existing cross-reference error regarding mortgagee consent for exchange of Certificates of Documentation;
by implementing statutory requirements concerning the endorsements on Certificates of Documentation for dredges
and towing vessels; and by making other minor technical amendments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information




The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, Project Manager,
and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History



On June 20, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Documentation of Vessels''
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 31580). The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held.



Background and Purpose



On November 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60256) which revised 46 CFR Part 67 to implement a number of statutory initiatives to simplify and streamline
the documentation process, to implement user fees for vessel documentation services, and to clarify the regulations
and present them in a more orderly fashion. The final rule was the subject of two correction documents which appeared
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 13, 1993, at 58 FR 65130 and 58 FR 65243. That final rule became effective on January 1, 1994. The present
rulemaking, among other things, corrects certain errors and omissions in the 1993 final rule. It also clarifies the
citizenship requirements for a trust arrangement as a vessel-owning entity, and states the endorsements required
for dredges and towing vessels.

On June 7, 1988, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app.  316 (Pub. L. 100-329) to require towing vessels to be documented
with a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, as appropriate. On November 4, 1992, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app.
 292 (Pub. L. 102-587) to require vessels of at least five net tons engaged in dredging in the navigable
waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement. Neither of these statutory requirements
were included in the revision of Part 67. In order to state those requirements and to clarify the endorsement requirements
for vessels employed in towing or dredging, the regulations need to be amended. This rule accomplishes that amendment.

Discussion of Comments and Changes



The Coast Guard received only one comment letter in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. That comment addresses
only the proposed amendment to redesignated  67.36 regarding trusts.

Proposed  67.36 set forth the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements as vessel-owning entities.
In addition, the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements were described in detail, like those for corporations
and partnerships, to specify the requirements for each endorsement. Paragraph (a) of proposed  67.36 set forth
the general requirements for a registry or recreational endorsement that each trustee and each beneficiary with
an enforceable interest in the trust be citizens. This paragraph simply restated the current regulatory requirements
for trusts found in  67.37. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed  67.36 set forth the citizenship requirements
for a fishery endorsement and a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, respectively. These requirements reflect
the statutory citizenship requirements for these endorsements applicable to any business entity owning a documented
vessel. The owner citizenship requirements for a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement may be found in  2 of the
Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. app.  802) and 46 U.S.C.  12107, respectively, and the owner citizenship
requirements for a fishery endorsement may be found in 46 U.S.C.  12108. None of the current citizenship requirements
for trusts would have been changed by the proposal.

The comment raised three points concerning proposed  67.36. First, the comment stated that the term ``trust
arrangement'' is not a well defined or easily understood concept in law, and questioned how it should be distinguished
from the term ``trust'', which is a well defined and understood concept. The Coast Guard recognizes that there are
numerous kinds of trusts. Indeed, reference to ``Black's Law Dictionary'' (Fifth Edition) reveals some 75 kinds
of defined trusts. One of the general definitions of a trust is, ``Any arrangement whereby property is transferred
with intention that it be administered by trustee for another's benefit.'' The Coast Guard's intention in using the
term ``trust arrangement'' is to permit the use of as wide a range of trust types as vessel-owning entities as permissible.
The Coast Guard disagrees that the term is confusing or that it need be distinguished from ``trust''. Therefore, the
term will not be changed in the final rule.

The second point raised by the comment concerns the requirement that each beneficiary with an enforceable interest
in the trust be a citizen. The comment notes that in some trusts the beneficiaries are often unborn persons. The comment
noted that while such an unborn beneficiary has an enforceable interest in the trust, that same beneficiary, by virtue
of being unborn, has no citizenship. The comment reasons that the effect of the requirement will be to preclude trusts
with unborn beneficiaries from qualifying as a vessel-owning entity for documentation purposes.

An unborn beneficiary as described in the comment could have a vested interest in the trust. However, that interest
would also be a contingent interest_with live birth being the minimum condition_which means that the interest is
not a present interest. The Coast Guard's position is that the determinants of U.S. citizenship, even under circumstances
of dual citizenship of infants, are sufficiently well settled that the citizenship of beneficiaries who hold present
enforceable interests can be established. The Coast Guard never intended for the requirement of an enforceable interest
to apply to mere contingent interests. Rather, the intent of the requirement is to permit the designation of discretionary
or charitable beneficiaries who do not have to meet the citizenship requirement. Since the issue of the citizenship
of beneficiaries holding the kinds of contingent future interests mentioned by the comment is not ripe for determination
until the interest becomes a present interest, the Coast Guard sees no need to change the requirement.

The third point raised by the comment concerns the additional requirement in paragraph (c) of  67.36 to obtain
a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, that at least 75 percent of the equity interest in the trust be owned by citizens.
The comment concluded that since paragraph (a), in effect, requires all beneficiaries to be citizens, the additional
equity interest requirement is rendered absurd. The Coast Guard disagrees with the conclusion of the comment that
paragraph (a) requires that all beneficiaries be citizens. Since those beneficiaries who do not have an enforceable
interest do not have to meet the citizenship requirement, the additional requirement is needed to limit foreign equitable
ownership to not more than 25 percent. The percentage parameters is consistent with all other citizen/foreign ownership
interest parameters for a vessel qualified to engage in the coastwise trade.

The wording of proposed  67.36, as well as other proposed amendments described in the notice of proposed rulemaking,
are unchanged in this final rule.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. As discussed earlier in this preamble,
this rulemaking clarifies the citizenship requirements of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, corrects certain errors
and omissions made in the 1993 final rule which revised 46 CFR part 67, clarifies a cross-reference with regard to calculation
of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and addresses the statutorily required endorsements for vessels
employed in towing and dredging. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on
the regulated public.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rulemaking will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

The Coast Guard expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal because it only clarifies the structure of a trust
as a vessel-owning entity, corrects certain errors and omissions made in the 1993 final rule which revised 46 CFR part
67, clarifies a cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and addresses
the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed in towing or dredging. This proposal would bring the
regulations into conformity with current policy and practice. These matters are administrative in nature and do
not have any economic impacts on the regulated public. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This rule has been determined to be categorically excluded because the changes are administrative in nature and clearly
have no environmental impact. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection
or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.

Final Rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY

: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), announces
a reorganization and republication of the list of endangered and threatened plants. Previously organized alphabetically
by plant family, the plants will now be placed in the list in alphabetical order by scientific name under broad taxonomic
groupings as follows: Flowering Plants, Conifers and Cycads, Ferns and Fern Allies, and Lichens and Fungi. The family
name will be retained in a separate column in the list. This republication of the plant list includes all changes published
in the 

Federal Register

 through August 19, 1994, but does not promulgate any new regulatory changes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





Background



Pursuant to section 4(c)(1) of the Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is required to maintain the lists of
endangered and threatened wildlife and plants (50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12). Since the lists were first established, the
Service has sequenced plants ( 17.12) alphabetically by the name of the plant family and then alphabetically
within each family by scientific name. Almost 500 species of plants are now listed, in nearly 100 families. In an effort
to make this list more useful to the general public and other users, the Service is now reorganizing the sequence of
the plants so that they are alphabetical by scientific name within each of four major groups (Flowering Plants, Conifers
and Cycads, Ferns and Fern Allies, and Lichens and Fungi). Additional major groups may be added in the future as necessary
(e.g., Mosses and Algae).

This reorganized and republished list incorporates no regulatory changes (e.g., addition or deletion of species,
changes in endangered or threatened status) that have not been previously published in the 

Federal Register

. As indicated at  17.12(d), the Service may correct or update the spelling of names, historical range information,
footnotes, references to certain other applicable portions of this title, synonyms, and more current names without
public notice; such information is non-regulatory in nature and is provided for the benefit of the reader. Such changes
are incorporated in this republication of the list, as they have been in the past annual codifications of this section.



Authority: 



The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

).

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant 

Tetramolopium

 

capillare

 (pamakani). Two extant populations containing a total of 12 known individuals of the species remain in the southwestern
portion of West Maui. The species and its habitat have been variously affected or are currently threatened by fire
and by habitat degradation and competition from invasive alien plant species. Due to the small number of existing
individuals and their very narrow distribution, this species is subject to reduced reproductive vigor and/or an
increased likelihood of extinction from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and
recovery provisions provided by the Act. It also makes operative State regulations that will protect 

Tetramolopium

 

capillare

 as an endangered species.

Tetramolopium capillare

 was first collected in 1819 on Maui by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre. He named this sterile specimen 

Senecio capillaris

, choosing the specific epithet to refer to its very narrow involute leaves (with margins rolled under along the edges)
(Gaudichaud-Beaupre 1830). Based on a fertile specimen collected on Maui in the 1830s, Sherff (1935) described and
named 

Tetramolopium bennettii.

 After examining and comparing type specimens, St. John (1965) determined that Gaudichaud-Beaupre's 

Senecio capillaris

 and Sherff's 

Tetramolopium bennettii

 were actually the same species and that Sherff had placed the taxon in the correct genus; St. John (1965) subsequently
made the new combination 

Tetramolopium capillare.

 Later, St. John (1974) described a new genus, 

Luteidiscus

, for species of 

Tetramolopium

 with yellow disk florets, and formed the combination 

Luteidiscus capillaris.

 In the current treatment of the genus, Lowrey (1981, 1986, 1990) does not recognize St. John's division of the genus.




Tetramolopium capillare

 is a sprawling shrub with stems measuring 50 to 80 centimeters (cm) (20 to 31 inches (in)) long and covered with many
glands when young. The very firm, stalkless leaves are involute and are usually 13 to 25 millimeters (mm) (0.5 to 1 in)
long and 0.4 mm (about 0.01 in) wide. Flower heads are situated singly at the ends of stalks 1 to 3.5 cm (0.4 to 1.4 in) long.
Located beneath each flower head are 45 to 50 bracts, arranged in a structure 3 to 4 mm (about 0.1 in) high and 7 to 10 mm
(0.3 to 0.4 in) in diameter. In each flower head, 30 to 50 white, male ray florets, 3.5 to 4 mm (about 0.1 in) long and 0.6
to 8 mm (0.02 to 0.3 in) wide, surround 15 to 25 greenish yellow tinged with red, functionally female florets about 3.6
mm (0.1 in) long. The achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits) measure 2 to 2.6 mm (0.08 to 0.1 in) long and 0.7 to 0.8 mm (0.03
in) wide and are topped by a white pappus comprising a single series of bristles 1.9 to 2.1 mm (0.07 to 0.08 in) long. 

Tetramolopium capillare

 differs from other species of the genus by its very firm leaves with edges rolled under, its solitary flower heads,
the color of its disk florets, and its shorter pappus. It differs from 

Tetramolopium remyi

, with which it sometimes grows, by its more sprawling habit and the shorter stalks of its smaller flower heads (Lowrey
1990). 

Historically, 

Tetramolopium capillare

 is known from Lahainaluna to Wailuku on West Maui (Lowrey 1981). This species is known to be extant near Halepohaku
on State land (Hawaii Plant Conservation Center (HPCC) 1992a, 1992b). The two known populations, which are separated
by 2.4 kilometers (km) (1.8 miles (mi)), contain a total of 12 known plants (Steve Perlman, HPCC, pers. comms., 1992).


Tetramolopium capillare

 typically grows on rock substrates at elevations between 615 and 900 meters (m) (2,020 to 3,000 feet (ft)) in Lowland
Dry Mixed Shrub and Grassland and in Montane Dry Shrubland. Plant species associated with the higher elevation population
include 

Dodonaea viscosa

 ('a'ali'i), 

Metrosideros polymorpha

 ('ohi'a), and 

Styphelia tameiameiae

 (pukiawe). 'A'ali'i, 

Heteropogon contortus

 (pili grass), and 

Myoporum sandwicense

 (naio) are associates of the other population. The major threats to 

Tetramolopium capillare

 are fire; competition from alien plant species, particularly 

Lantana camara

 (lantana), 

Leucaena leucocephala

 (koa haole), and 

Rynchelytrum repens

 (Natal redtop); and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the small number
of existing populations and individuals (HPCC 1992a, 1992b).

Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States.
This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,


Tetramolopium capillare 

was considered to be extinct. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including 

Tetramolopium capillare

. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including 

Tetramolopium capillare

, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December
15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these notices, 

Tetramolopium capillare

 was treated as a Category 1* species. Category 1* species are those that are possibly extinct. Because the species
was rediscovered in 1991, it is now being listed as endangered. 
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months
of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13,
1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned
listing of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the
Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition
to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986,
1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final one-year finding for this
species. 
On March 25, 1993, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 16164) a proposal to list the plant 

Tetramolopium capillare

 as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information from the Hawaii Plant Conservation Center and observations
by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines 

Tetramolopium capillare

 to be endangered with the publication of this rule. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the March 25, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. The public comment
period ended May 24, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment
was published in the ``Honolulu Star-Bulletin'' on April 19, 1993. One letter of comment was received, supporting
the listing of 

Tetramolopium capillare

. The one issue raised in this letter is discussed below.

Issue: 

Over-collection of this species is not likely, and placing emphasis on this issue will make scientific research and
horticultural conservation of the species more difficult. 


Response: 

The Service feels that unrestricted collecting should not be allowed, since only two populations totaling 12 individuals
are known. This should not adversely affect non-destructive scientific research and 

ex situ

 conservation efforts, since permits would still be available for these purposes. 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered
species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to


Tetramolopium capillare

 (Gaud.) St. John are as follows: 
A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. 

The habitat of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including grazing and alien
plant introductions. Cattle (

Bos taurus

), the wild progenitor of which was native to Europe, north Africa, and southwestern Asia, were introduced to the Hawaiian
Islands in 1793. This animal eats native vegetation, tramples roots and seedlings, causes erosion, creates disturbed
areas into which alien plants invade, and spreads seeds of alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Feral cattle were
formerly found on Maui and affected areas within the historic range of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 (Lowrey 1981). 
B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. 

Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and substrate damage by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to 

Tetramolopium capillare

, which has only two populations and a total of 12 known individuals. Any collection of whole plants of this species
could cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival of the species. 
C. 

Disease or predation. 

No evidence of disease or predation of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 has been reported. 
D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

No State or Federal regulations currently protect 

Tetramolopium capillare

. However, Federal listing will automatically invoke endangered species status under Hawaii's endangered species
act. 
E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 

The small number of individuals and populations of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor,
or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals
or an entire population. Erosion due to natural weathering in areas where 

Tetramolopium capillare

 grows can result in the death of individual plants as well as habitat destruction. This process especially affects
the continued existence of taxa or populations with limited numbers and/or narrow ranges, such as 

Tetramolopium capillare

, and can be exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices. 
Erosion provides a suitable site for colonization by alien plants. Three alien plant taxa, naturalized in dry, disturbed
areas on all the main Hawaiian islands, compete with 

Tetramolopium capillare

. Natal redtop, an annual or perennial grass, is a major threat to both populations of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 (HPCC 1992a, 1992b; O'Connor 1990). Both koa haole, often the dominant species in dry, disturbed, low elevation areas,
and lantana, an aggressive, thicket-forming shrub, have also invaded the habitat of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 (Geesnick 

et al. 

1990; HPCC 1992a; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1992). Because both populations of 

Tetramolopium capillare

 grow in dry areas, fire is considered a threat to the species (HPCC 1992a; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1992).

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in this final rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action
is to list 

Tetramolopium capillare 

as endangered. This species numbers no more than about 12 individuals in two populations and is threatened by habitat
degradation, competition from alien plants, fire, and lack of legal protection. Small population size and limited
distribution make this species particularly vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic
events. Because this species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it fits
the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. 

Critical habitat is not being proposed for 

Tetramolopium capillare 

for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this final rule. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the species is listed endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for 

Tetramolopium capillare. 

The publication of a map and precise description of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

 and local newspapers as required in a designation of critical habitat would increase the degree of threat to this species
from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline and increase enforcement problems. The listing
of this species as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and, thus, can make the species attractive to researchers,
curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. The species is found exclusively on State land. Interested parties
and the State landowner have been notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of 

Tetramolopium capillare. 

Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because
such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities, and
is unlikely to aid in conservation of the species. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to taxa listed as endangered under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing
encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, private organizations, and individuals. The
Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions be carried
out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities
involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any taxon
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service. No known Federal activities occur within the habitat of 

Tetramolopium capillare

, which is found only on State land.

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plants set forth a series
of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to 

Tetramolopium capillare

, all of the prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,
in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell
or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under
Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or
remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation
or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise
prohibited activities involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that
few trade permits would ever be sought or issued. The species is not common in the wild and is only rarely cultivated.


Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Office, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E.
11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063; FAX 503/231-6243). 



Tetramolopium capillare

 is not presently listed as an endangered species by the State of Hawaii. Both populations of this species occur on State
land. Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species act. Hawaii's Endangered
Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered
species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions
of this chapter * * *'' (HRS, sect. 195D-4(a)). State law prohibits taking of endangered plants
in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sect. 195D-4). State laws relating to the conservation
of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs
concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D-5(a)). The State also may enter into
agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement,
or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D-5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available
under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements). 

Conservation district lands are regarded, among other purposes, as necessary for the protection of endemic biological
resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Requests for amendments
to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private
landowners (HRS, sect. 205-4). The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is mandated to initiate
changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora and fauna within
the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D-5.1). Hawaii environmental policy, and thus approval of land
use, is required by law to safeguard ``* * * the State's unique natural environmental characteristics
* * *'' (HRS, sect. 344-3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``Protect endangered species of individual
plants and animals * * *'' (HRS, sect. 344-4(3)(A)). Federal listing, because it results in
State listing, also triggers these other State regulations protecting 

Tetramolopium capillare

. Listing under the Federal Act would also provide additional protection to this species by making it an offense for
any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction in knowing
violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Inseason adjustment; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues an inseason adjustment prohibiting retention of rockfish species of the genera 

Sebastes

 and 

Sebastolobus

 by vessels using trawl gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent
overfishing of Pacific ocean perch (POP).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


The Magnuson Act requires that conservation and management measures prevent overfishing. The 1994 overfishing
level for POP in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA is established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647,
February 16, 1994) as 1,100 metric tons (mt) and the acceptable biological catch as 850 mt. The final specifications
closed directed fishing for POP in the Central Regulatory Area. As of September 30, 1994, NMFS anticipates that 880
mt of POP will have been caught.
NMFS prohibited retention of POP on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 44341). Substantial trawl fishing effort will be directed
at remaining amounts of groundfish in the GOA during 1994. These fisheries can have significant bycatch of POP.
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  672.22(a)(1)(i) and (a)(4), that closing
the season by prohibiting retention of rockfish species of the genera 

Sebastes

 and 

Sebastolobus

 by vessels using trawl gear is necessary to prevent overfishing of POP, and is the least restrictive measure to achieve
that purpose. Without this prohibition of retention, significant incidental catch of POP would occur by operators
of trawl vessels seeking to retain as much rockfish as possible under the standards for directed fishing  672.20(g).
Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of rockfish species of the genera 

Sebastes

 and 

Sebastolobus

 by vessels using trawl gear in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA be treated as prohibited species under  672.20(e)
effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 30, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds for good cause that providing prior notice and public comment
or delaying the effective date of this action is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Without this inseason
adjustment, POP in the Central Regulatory Area of the GOA will be overfished, jeopardizing the long-term capacity
of that stock. Under  672.22(c), interested persons are invited to submit written comments on this action to
the above address until October 15, 1994.


Classification


This action is taken under  672.22 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component
in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is
necessary to prevent exceeding the allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the offshore component
in the AI.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


The allowance of pollock TAC for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI was established
by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and a subsequent reserve apportionment
(59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 34,031 metric tons (mt). 
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional
Director established a directed fishing allowance of 32,831 mt after determining that 1,200 mt will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in the AI. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock
by operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the AI effective from 12 noon,
A.l.t., September 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. 
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may befound in the regulations at  675.20(h).

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments require the establishment of two 
clean-fuel vehicle programs: a Clean Fuel Fleet Program and a California Pilot Test 
Program. Under the Clean Fuel Fleet Program, a percentage of new vehicles 
acquired by certain fleet owners located in covered areas will be required to meet 
clean-fuel fleet vehicle emission standards. Fleet owners can comply with this 
requirement by purchasing new clean-fuel fleet vehicles, by converting conventional 
vehicles to clean-fuel fleet vehicles, or by acquiring ``credits'' pursuant to a credits 
program. Affected states are required to revise their State Implementation Plans to 
implement the fleet program, including provisions to implement a credit program and 
exempt clean-fuel fleet vehicles from certain transportation control measures. 
Regulations have already been promulgated for the credit program and transportation 
control measures exemptions. Also, definitions of terms used with the Clean Fuel 
Fleet program have recently been finalized. The other Clean Air Act clean-fuel vehicle 
program is the California Pilot Test program. This program requires manufacturers to 
sell light-duty clean-fuel vehicles in the state of California. EPA has established a 
credit program for the California Pilot Test Program in a separate rulemaking.

This action promulgates the statutory requirements that have not been implemented to date. 
These include the emission standards for light-duty and heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, regulations 
for the conversion of conventional vehicles to clean-fuel fleet vehicles, manufacturer California 
clean-fuel vehicles sales requirements under the California Pilot Test Program, and a state opt-in 
program for the California Pilot Test Program. The part of the conversion provisions addressing the 
sales volume limit beyond which special small-volume manufacturer provisions will not apply, will 
not become effective sooner than 60 days after publication and then only if no adverse comment is 
received within 30 days of publication. If adverse comment is received within 30 days of 
publication, EPA will withdraw this part of the rule pending a full notice and comment process on 
this topic.

B. Background 



The Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-549) added 
part C to Title II of the CAA entitled, ``Clean Fuel Vehicles''. Under part C, states are 
to establish clean fuel fleet programs (collectively called the Clean Fuel Fleet (or CFF) 
program) in certain nonattainment areas and EPA is to establish a clean-fuel vehicle 
(CFV) pilot program in the State of California (the California Pilot Test program or Pilot 
program). 

The purpose of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program is to introduce light- and heavy-duty CFVs in specified ``covered areas''
with air quality problems. CAA section 
246(a)(2) defines a ``covered area'' for purposes of the fleet program as an area 
having a 1980 population of 250,000 or more that is also (1) a serious, severe, or 
extreme ozone nonattainment area (based on 1987-1989 data), or (2) a carbon 
monoxide (CO) nonattainment area with a CO design value at or above 16.0 parts per 
million (based on 1988-1989 data). Currently, there are 22 such areas in 19 states 
(Table 1).

These states are required to revise their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to 
ensure that ``covered fleet'' owners will include, through purchase or lease, a minimum 
percentage of CFVs among the new vehicles they purchase for their fleets. (A 
``covered fleet'' is defined in CAA section 241 as a fleet of ten or more motor vehicles 
which are owned or operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by a single person.) 
Both private business and government (federal, state, and local) fleets are subject to 
the statute. However, certain fleets and vehicles are exempt from the regulations, 
including fleets with vehicles that cannot be fueled at a central location, vehicles that 
are normally garaged at a personal residence, or vehicles that belong to vehicle 
classes without applicable CFV standards. (See the Definitions Rule: 58 FR 64679, 
December 9, 1993). In their SIP revisions, states must include provisions to require 
that CFVs used in the clean fuel fleet program operate on fuels on which they comply 
with the CFV standards. 


Covered fleet operaters can also meet the requirements by converting 
conventional vehicles to CFVs, or by obtaining credits. CAA section 246(a)(3) requires 
that all states containing all or part of an ozone and/or CO nonattainment area 
described above that is reclassified in the future as a serious, severe, or extreme 
ozone nonattainment area, or has a CO design value at or above 16.0 parts per 
million, must prepare revised SIPs implementing the CFF program within one year of 
reclassification. 

Three vehicle classes are included in the CFF program: light-duty vehicles 
(LDVs) and light-duty trucks (LDTs) up to 8,500 lbs GVWR,
 and heavy-duty vehicles 
(HDVs) between 8,500 lbs and 26,000 lbs GVWR.
 To qualify as a CFV, a vehicle 
must meet one of three sets of increasingly stringent standards. These are referred to 
as low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards, ultra low-emission vehicle (ULEV) standards, 
and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) standards. 






CAA section 242(a) requires EPA to promulgate CFV emission standards for 
purposes of compliance with the CFF program and the Pilot program (LEV standards). 
In addition, section 246(f)(4) requires EPA to promulgate emission standards for 
purposes of the CFF program credit program (ULEV and ZEV standards). Under 
section 249(d)(3), the CFF credit program standards will also apply to the Pilot credit 
program. Therefore, vehicles that meet ULEV or ZEV standards are eligible for 
vehicle purchase credits under the CFF program and for manufacturers' credits under 
the Pilot program. 

The CAA Amendments of 1990 require EPA to promulgate a Pilot program for 
the sale of CFVs in the State of California. Whereas the CFF program will be run by 
individual states, the Pilot program is a federal program that will be administered in 
California. Manufacturers with motor vehicle sales in California are required to sell a 
minimum number of light-duty CFVs (CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR) in California on 
an annual basis. Manufacturers may meet their share of required sales by selling the 
required number of CFVs or by using earned credits or credits they have acquired 
from other manufacturers. (EPA established the credits program in a previous 
rulemaking (57 FR 60038; December 17, 1992)). To earn credits, a manufacturer may 
sell more CFVs than required or sell CFVs which meet stricter exhaust emission 
standards. Except for heavy LDTs, for model years 1996 through 2001, the 
compliance standards for the Pilot program are known as the TLEV standards and 
credits are available for LEV, ULEV and ZEV purchases. Beginning in 2001, the 
compliance vehicle shifts to the LEV standards, and credits are only available for 
ULEV and ZEV purchases. This provision commences in the 1998 model year for 
heavy LDTs. 

The CAA also directs EPA to establish a voluntary opt in program for states 
that want to adopt the Pilot program. States which contain all or part of any ozone 
nonattainment areas classified under subpart D of Title II as serious, severe, or 
extreme are eligible to participate. To do so, states are to revise their state 
implementation plans (SIPs) to include incentives for the sale and use of CFVs as well 
as the production and distribution of clean alternative fuels. States may not establish 
CFV sales or production mandates, however. 

The remainder of today's action covers light- and heavy-duty CFV exhaust 
emission standards, requirements for vehicle conversions to CFVs, and the Pilot 
program, as well as regulatory impacts of the CFF and Pilot programs. In addition, 
EPA has included several technical amendments and clarifications related to the 
Definitions rule (58 FR 64679) and the rulemaking for the CFF credits program and 
transportation control measure exemptions (58 FR 11888; March 1, 1993).

II. Description of Action 


A. Clean-Fuel Vehicle Emission Standards 


CAA section 242 requires EPA to promulgate regulations setting emission 
standards and other requirements for CFVs. For LDVs and LDTs, EPA is required to 
adopt the standards set forth in sections 242 and 243 unless it finds that the 
standards of the California Air Resources Board LEV program are, in the aggregate, at 
least as protective of public health and welfare as the federal standards that would 
apply to CFVs. EPA cannot make such a finding at this time so today's regulations 
adopt the standards set forth in the CAA. 


1. Light-Duty Vehicle and Light-Duty Truck Clean-Fuel Vehicle Standards 


a. 

Requirements of the CAA.

 
Clean Air Act section 241(7) defines a CFV as a vehicle that meets the 
emission standards applicable under part C of Title II of the CAA. As discussed later 
in this preamble, CFVs will satisfy the requirements of both the Pilot program and the 
CFF program. The CFV emission standards for LDVs and LDTs are set forth in 
sections 242 and 243. (Standards for heavy-duty CFVs under section 245 of the Act 
are discussed in II.A.2 below.) Any LDV, LDT, or HDV that can operate on only one 
fuel and that meets these standards will be classified as a CFV regardless of the fuel 
that is used to meet the CFV standards. However, a CFV in the CFF program must 
operate on clean alternative fuels, as defined in section 241(2) of the Act, when 
operating in the covered area. 
Subsections 243(a) through (d) specify LDV and LDT exhaust emission 
standards (50K and 100K miles)
 for the following pollutants: non-methane organic 
gas (NMOG), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

), diesel particulate 
matter (PM) (only for the 100,000 mile point), and formaldehyde (HCHO). These 
standards are prescribed in two phases for LDVs and light LDTs (up to 5,750 pounds 
loaded vehicle weight (LVW) and 6,000 pounds GVWR). Phase I applies only to the 
Pilot program and takes effect with the 1996 model year (MY), the first year of 
required sales under the Pilot program. These statutory Phase I standards are 
numerically identical to those which define the California Transitional Low Emission 
Vehicle (TLEV).
 The Phase I standards apply to the Pilot program in MYs 1996 
through 2001. Phase II standards are identical to those which define the California 
Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).
 The Phase II standards apply to the CFF program in 
MY 1998 and to the Pilot program beginning in MY 2001. Only one set of exhaust 
emission standards applies to heavy LDTs (above 6,000 lbs. GVWR). These 
standards take effect in MY 1998 and apply to both the CFF and the Pilot program. 
Table 2 contains the TLEV and LEV standards for LDV and LDT CFVs. 







CAA part C section 241 specifies that definitions contained in part A, section 
216, shall apply to the CFV programs. The heavy LDT subcategories (i.e., above 
6,000 lbs. GVWR) shown in Table 2 are based on test weight. CAA section 216(8) 
defines ``test weight'', or ``TW'', as the sum of the curb weight and the GVWR divided 
by two: 



TW = (Curb weight + GVWR)/2 = ALVW

 

This definition was established in 40 CFR 86.129-94 by the federal Tier 1 rulemaking 
(56 FR 25724; June 5, 1991) and is referred to as ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'', or 
``ALVW''. The Agency chose to use ALVW, as opposed to TW, to minimize confusion 
with the term ``equivalent test weight'', which is used interchangeably with ``test weight'' 
throughout current EPA motor vehicle regulations and test procedures. Therefore, 
``test weight'' defined in CAA section 216(8) is referred to as ALVW in this Final Rule, 
which is consistent with its definition established in the Tier 1 regulations.

CAA section 242(c) lists the useful life and in-use testing limitations for purposes of determining 
in-use compliance with the standards in section 243. The useful life for CFVs is the same as adopted 
in EPA's regulations for 1994 and later model year LDVs and LDTs, commonly called Tier 1 standards 
(56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991). For LDVs and LDTs, the standards in section 243 are established at the 
intermediate useful life of five years or 50,000 miles (5/50,000), whichever occurs first, and a full useful 
life of 10 years or 100,000 miles (10/100,000), whichever occurs first (see Table 2). With respect to in-use testing,
however, section 242(c) provides that such testing for these vehicle classes would not be 
done beyond seven years or 75,000 miles, whichever occurs first. The analogous intermediate and full 
useful life levels for heavy LDTs are 5/50,000 and 11/120,000, respectively (see Table 2). Similarly, 
section 242(c) provides that the in-use testing for these vehicles would not be done beyond seven 
years or 90,000 miles, whichever occurs first. 
While the standards described above apply to single fuel CFVs, subsection 243(d) also establishes different CFV
NMOG standards for dual and flexible fuel LDVs and LDTs.
 These vehicles are to be certified to two sets of NMOG standards (Table 3). One set contains the same NMOG levels 
that apply to single fuel CFVs; dual and flexible fuel vehicles must meet this standard when operating on the clean
alternative fuel on which they are certified (section 243(d)(2)). The second set of NMOG standards applies to flexible
and dual fuel vehicles when operated on conventional fuel for which they are certified (section 243(d)(3)).
 This second set of standards is, in effect, equivalent to the next less stringent set of standards for the applicable
vehicle category and model year. For example, the Phase I NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional
fuel is equivalent to the Tier I non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions standard.
 The Phase II NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional fuel is equivalent to the Phase I standard
for single fuel CFVs. The NMOG standards for flexible and dual fuel vehicles are listed in Table 3. Flexible or dual
fuel vehicles must comply with all other CFV exhaust standards shown in Table 2 and with all other applicable requirements
of Title II.

CAA section 246(f)(4) directs EPA to establish additional CFV standards for 
ULEVs and ZEVs (discussed earlier). These standards, shown in Table 4, should be 
more stringent than the CFV standards in section 243. Vehicles meeting these more 
stringent standards are eligible to earn credits which may be used toward compliance 
under the CFF program or the Pilot program, as specified in sections 246(f) and 
249(d)(3), respectively. The Act requires EPA to set these more stringent standards 
for LDVs and LDTs so that they conform ``as closely as possible'' to the ULEV and 
ZEV standards established by California for vehicles in the same class. The California 
ULEV and ZEV standards are described below in section A.1.b. in this preamble.

CAA section 242(b) states that CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR ``shall comply with 
all motor vehicle requirements of this title (i.e., on-board diagnostics, evaporative 
emissions, etc.) which are applicable to conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles of the 
same category and model year, except as provided in section 244 with respect to 
administration and enforcement, and except to the extent that any such requirement is 
in conflict with the provisions of'' part C. These include, but are not limited to, 
standards for cold temperature CO exhaust emissions (cold CO), on-board diagnostics 
(OBD), evaporative emission controls (evap), and onboard refueling vapor recovery 
(ORVR). Previous requirements such as crankcase controls and vehicle labeling also 
apply. 
CAA section 243(e) directs EPA to apply the standards of the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) LEV program in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable 
to CFVs under sections 242 and 243 if the CARB standards are, in the aggregate, at 
least as protective of public health and welfare as the federal standards that apply to 
CFVs. Section 243(e)(1) addresses the replacement of CAA standards if CARB 
promulgates a single set of standards while section 243(e)(2) addresses the 
replacement if CARB promulgates multiple sets of standards. CARB's LEV program 
contains multiple sets of standards to which vehicles can certify (i.e., LEV, ULEV, and 
ZEV); therefore, section 243(e)(2) is the appropriate language for consideration and is 
provided below:

 

Section 243(e)(2): If the State of California promulgates regulations establishing 
and implementing several different sets of standards applicable in California pursuant 
to a waiver approved under section 209 to any category of vehicles referred to in 
subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section and each of such sets of California 
standards is, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as 
the otherwise applicable standards set forth in section 242 and subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section, such
standards shall be treated as `qualifying California 
standards' for purposes of this paragraph. Where more than one set of qualifying 
standards are established and administered by the State of California, the least 
stringent set of qualifying California standards shall apply to the clean-fuel vehicles 
concerned in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable to such vehicles under section 
242 and this section. 



EPA believes that the required comparison between the federal and CARB 
standards is not limited to the CFV exhaust emission standards of sections 242 and 
243 but must also include the other Title II standards referred to in CAA section 242 
(i.e., OBD, evap, etc.) and any California counterparts. Thus, EPA is required to 
compare the standards in CAA sections 242(b) and 243 with the CARB standards to 
determine whether the CARB standards should replace the federal standards.

As is discussed below in Section II.c., EPA cannot at this time make the 
determination that each set of CARB standards is, in the aggregate, at least as 
protective as the federal standards that apply to CFVs. Therefore, this final rule 
promulgates the emission standards and requirements for CFVs found in sections 242 
and 243 of the CAA. EPA's reasoning to support this conclusion is included in Section 
II.c. 
Finally, CAA section 244 provides requirements regarding the administration 
and enforcement of CFV exhaust emission standards. In the event that numerical 
emission standards for CFVs up to 8,500 lbs. GVWR are the same under the federal 
and California LEV program, EPA is to administer and enforce those standards in the 
same manner and with the same flexibility as CARB does under the California LEV 
program. This requires utilizing the same interpretations and policy judgments 
including, but not limited to, requirements regarding certification, production-line 
testing, and in-use compliance. The application of California's administration and 
enforcement practices does not depend on whether EPA replaces federal 
requirements with California requirements under section 243(e). If the Administrator 
determines that adopting California's administration and enforcement approaches 
would not meet the criteria for a waiver under section 209, then federal administration 
and enforcement procedures and interpretations would apply. 
b. 

CARB's Low-Emission Vehicle Standards. 

Pursuant to CAA section 209, the State of California applied to EPA for a 
waiver on October 4, 1991 for its ``Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels 
Regulations''. EPA granted the waiver on January 7, 1993 (58 FR 4166, January 13, 
1993). (Although states are generally preempted by CAA section 209 from adopting 
their own motor vehicle standards, California may adopt its own standards provided 
that EPA waivers the preemption provision of section 209.) 
California's regulations establish four new levels of vehicle emission standards, termed ``vehicle emission categories'',
for LDVs, LDTs, and medium-duty trucks (MDTs).
 These new standards are effective with 1994 model year vehicles.
 The California emission categories are, in order of increasing stringency: TLEV (Transitional Low Emission Vehicle);
LEV (Low Emission Vehicle); ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle); and ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle). The TLEV exhaust
emission standards for NMOG, CO, NO

X

, PM, and HCHO are identical to the federal Phase I CFV standards described above. The LEV exhaust emission standards
are identical to the federal Phase II CFV standards. The California ULEV and ZEV standards are the same as the federal
ULEV and ZEV categories, established for purposes of the CFF and Pilot program credit programs. CARB defines a ZEV
as:

 




* * * any vehicle which is certified * * * to produce zero emissions of any 
criteria pollutants under any and all possible operational modes and 
conditions. A ZEV may be equipped with a fuel fired heater provided 
that the fuel fired heater cannot be operated at ambient temperatures 
above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and the heater is demonstrated to have 
zero evaporative emissions under any and all possible operational modes 
and conditions.





CARB is allowing the use of intermediate in-use compliance standards that are 
intended to facilitate compliance by vehicle manufacturers. These in-use standards 
are numerically half way between the certification standards of the new emission 
category and the old emission category (e.g., half way between TLEV and LEV 
standards). These intermediate standards will be effective through MY 1995 for TLEVs 
and through MY 1998 for LEVs and ULEVs. 
c. 

Comparison of CAA and CARB Requirements. 

As discussed above, CAA section 243(e) provides that CARB's standards shall 
replace the federal CFV and other motor vehicle standards if the CARB standards are, 
in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the CAA 
standards. While EPA believes that Congress preferred that the statutory standards 
be replaced with the CARB standards, EPA cannot at this time make the 
determination that CARB standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective as the 
federal standards. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, EPA is at this time establishing 
federal standards that will apply to CFVs in the CFF and Pilot program. 
As stated in the proposal, EPA believes that section 243(e)(2) requires a 
separate comparison of federal Phase I and Phase II standards to CARB standards. 
For the least stringent set of federal CFV standards (the Phase I standards), the 
appropriate comparison is to the least stringent set of California CFV standards (the 
TLEV standards). Similarly, the appropriate comparison for the federal Phase II 
standards is with the California LEV standards. 
The Phase I standards will apply to the Pilot program in the 1996 MY. The 
phase II standards will apply to the CFF program in the 1998 MY, and to the Pilot 
program in the 2001 MY. Therefore, the federal Phase I standards will not apply to 
any federal CFV program after MY 2001. For this reason, EPA considers the 
California LEV standards to be the least stringent set of qualifying California standards 
after MY 2001, and currently intends to apply the California LEV standard to the CFF 
and Pilot programs at that time if replacement of the federal Phase II standards is 
warranted under section 243(e)(2). EPA requested comment in the proposal on this 
interpretation of the CAA and no adverse comments were received.

EPA must also compare CARB standards to the following federal requirements 
that apply to CFVs to assess whether ``each of such sets of California standards is, in 
the aggregate, at least as protective'' as the federal standards: cold CO emissions, 
evaporative emissions, onboard refueling vapor recovery, on-board diagnostics, total 
hydrocarbons, and non-methane hydrocarbon standards. These standards are 
compared individually below. 
i. 

Cold CO emissions. 

The currently waived California program does not have a cold CO standard which corresponds to the federal cold CO standard.
It is not yet possible for EPA to consider CARB's cold CO standards in its comparison of the respective mobile source
programs since California has not yet requested nor received a waiver. 
In vehicles using liquid fuel, the difficult process of vaporizing cold liquid fuel for combustion contributes significantly
to cold start emissions. Gasoline vehicles are most susceptible to this phenomenon in cold conditions. On July 17,
1992, EPA promulgated a cold CO standard (57 FR 31888, 40 CFR 86.201) in order to control CO emissions from gasoline-powered
vehicles when operating in cold temperatures.
 These regulations became effective for MY 1994. Although these regulations cover only gasoline-fueled vehicles,
CAA section 242(b) extends the regulations to all CFVs regardless of fuel type by requiring that CFVs meet all federal
requirements of Title II of the CAA that apply to gasoline vehicles of the same category and model year. 




On January 14, 1993, CARB approved a cold CO standard which became 
effective in September 1993. CARB's regulations include gasoline-fueled, LPG, and alcohol-fueled vehicles, but
do not cover other fuels. EPA is not able at this time to consider the CARB cold CO regulations because CARB has not requested
nor received a waiver of federal preemption for its cold CO requirements. 
ii. 

Evaporative emissions. 

The currently waived CARB evaporative emission standards and test procedures are not comparable to the recently
promulgated federal evaporative emission standards and test procedures. Current federal regulations for evaporative
emissions testing are effective through MY 1995, after which new federal regulations will be phased in. California
has two sets of new evaporative emissions regulations: one set will be implemented only for 10 percent of California's
MY 1995 vehicles and the second set, which CARB is in the process of finalizing at this time, will be phased in beginning
in MY 1996. Indications are that CARB will seek a waiver for their 1996 evaporative emission regulations once they
are finalized. EPA cannot yet consider CARB's revised evaporative emission regulations applicable to the 1995 and
later model years because CARB has not yet received a waiver for them. 
iii. 

Refueling emissions. 

Based on the currently waived California program, EPA cannot at this time conclude that CARB's refueling emission
control regulations are as stringent as the federal onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR) standards. The currently
waived California Program does not have a mobile source component which addresses refueling emissions. Federal
Title II standards for ORVR will be required on certain vehicles beginning in MY 1998 (59 FR 16262; April 6, 1994).
 CARB, which currently requires the use of Stage II vapor recovery equipment at most service stations in California,
has held two workshops to discuss the proper application of refueling control (November 2, 1993 and March 15, 1994).
CARB considered three options: adopting the federal ORVR regulations,; adopting a California-specific ORVR rule,
test, or standard; or maintaining that California's current motor vehicle control program is, in the aggregate,
at least as protective as the federal program notwithstanding the lack of ORVR controls. In a recent CARB mailout (94-27)
dated May 27, 1994, ARB staff announced their proposal to allow the certification of ORVR-equipped vehicles for sale
in California. However, the ARB staff did not address the equipped vehicles for sale in California. However, the ARB
staff did not address the specific issue of whether ARB will require ORVR controls for certification. California's
final determination regarding ORVR control must ultimately be approved by the Air Resources Board. 





EPA is likely to consider California's lack of an ORVR aspect of its program in 
the next section 209 waiver proceeding for CARB regulations applicable to model 
years 1998 and later. EPA will likely decide in that context whether California's motor 
vehicle program absent ORVR is at least as protective of California as the federal 
program. 
iv. 

Volatile organic compound emissions. 

EPA and California use different approaches to regulate emissions of volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) from vehicles. Therefore, EPA believes it is useful to 
compare California VOC emission standards to the analogous federal standards on a 
fuel-by-fuel basis, as presented below. For gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, EPA 
concludes that the CARB VOC emission standards are individually at least as stringent 
as the federal standards. However, EPA cannot make this comparison for gaseous 
and alcohol fuels at this time because CARB has not yet finalized RAFs (reactivity 
adjustment factors) for these fuels.

v. 

Fuel-by-fuel comparison. 

As stated above, EPA and CARB use different approaches to establish VOC 
emission standards. Traditionally, federal organic emissions controls have been based 
on total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions where mass of THC emissions is measured by 
a flame ionization detector (FID), implicitly assuming that all hydrocarbon emissions 
behave similarly with respect to ozone reactivity and FID response. This approach is 
not used for methanol-fueled vehicles because emissions from these vehicles consist 
primarily of methanol and formaldehyde, and a FID will only detect about 70 to 80 
percent of the methanol and very little of the formaldehyde. For methanol-fueled 
vehicles, the methanol and formaldehyde emissions are sampled separately and 
measured chromatographically while other emissions are measured by a FID. The 
oxygen mass is factored out of the methanol and formaldehyde emissions resulting in 
``equivalent hydrocarbon emissions'', which are then summed with the other FID-measured hydrocarbons to yield
organic material (or total) hydrocarbon equivalent 
(OMHCE or THCE) mass. A third approach involves separately measuring methane 
and subtracting it from the THC to result in a non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) 
mass. For methanol-fueled vehicles, NMHC is equivalent to OMNMHCE (organic 
material non-methane hydrocarbon equivalent) or NMHCE (non-methane hydrocarbon 
equivalent). 
The CAA has established THC and NMHC exhaust emission standards for 
conventional light-duty gasoline and diesel vehicles (0.41 g/mile for THC and 0.25 
g/mile for NMHC). EPA has also established OMHCE and OMNMHCE standards for 
methanol-fueled vehicles (0.41 and 0.25 g/mile, respectively), an NMHC standard for 
CNG-fueled vehicles (0.25 g/mile), and THC and NMHC standards for LPG-fueled 
vehicles identical to the gasoline THC and NMHC standards.







CARB measures VOC emissions as non-methane organic gases (NMOG). 
Under this approach, the mass of each organic compound except methane is 
measured and adjusted according to its ozone-forming reactivity relative to gasoline 
emissions. The sum of these adjusted masses is the amount of NMOG emitted from 
the vehicle. An alternative CARB NMOG method involves measuring the total mass of 
organic emissions and multiplying this mass by a single RAF for the particular fuel 
used. A RAF is equivalent to the ratio of the ozone-forming potential of emissions 
from a given fuel and the ozone-forming potential of conventional gasoline emissions. 
CARB determines a RAF for each fuel. Therefore, the relative stringency of the CARB 
and EPA standards for organic emissions should be compared for each fuel 
individually. 


Gasoline and Diesel Fuel 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00144 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, NMHC and NMOG standards are 
equivalent since CARB has established a RAF of 1.0 for these fuels. In addition, since the methane fraction of the THC
emissions from these vehicles is very low,
 and since CARB's TLEV and LEV NMOG standards (.125 and .075 g/mile, respectively) are well below the federal THC standard
(0.41 g/mile), vehicles designed to meet the CARB NMOG standard will not exceed the federal THC standard. Thus, for
gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, the CARB NMOG standards are at least as stringent as the federal THC and NMHC
standards. 








CNG Fuel 



The equivalency of CARB's NMOG standard with the federal NMHC standards 
cannot be strictly determined at this point for natural gas vehicles since CARB has not finalized a RAF for natural
gas. Indications are that CARB may enact a CNG RAF between 0.5 and 0.6. If CARB adopts a RAF of 0.5 or more, then EPA expects
that the CARB TLEV NMOG standard of 0.125 grams/mile (representing the least stringent set of CARB standards) will
be at least as stringent as the 0.25 grams/mile federal NMHC standard. A RAF of 0.3 or more would make the CARB LEV NMOG
standard of 0.075 grams/mile equivalent to the federal NMHC standard. 
CNG vehicles being certified as CFVs for use in the CFF and Pilot program will not be subject to the federal THC standard,
therefore, a comparison of the relative stringency between the federal THC and the CARB NMOG standard is not appropriate.
In the Pilot program NPRM (58 FR 34727, June 29, 1993), EPA requested comment on the appropriateness of applying a THC
standard to natural gas CFVs even though a THC standard is not applied to other natural gas vehicles. EPA believes that
requiring CNG vehicles to meet the federal THC standard would exclude CNG vehicles from participating in the CFF and
Pilot programs. CNG vehicles do produce high methane emissions; however, these emissions have a very low ozone reactivity
and are therefore not a significant contributor to ozone formation, which is a primary objective of both programs.
 In addition, CNG vehicles typically produce lower NMHC emissions than gasoline-fueled vehicles. Therefore, although
a THC standard would strictly limit the amount of methane emissions a CNG vehicle could emit, this result would be contrary
to the ozone-reduction goals of the programs when methane reactivity and lower NMHC emissions of CNG vehicles relative
to gasoline-fueled vehicles are considered. A further consideration in deciding whether to apply a THC standard
to CNG CFVs was the Agency's desire to maintain consistency with its Gaseous Fuels rule whenever possible; that rule
also does not apply THC standards to CNG vehicles. Commenters were not supportive of CNG vehicles, including CFVs,
being subject to a THC standard. 






LPG Fuel 



CARB has not finalized a RAF for LPG fuel. Therefore, EPA cannot at this time strictly compare the CARB NMOG standard
to the federal NMHC standard for LPG vehicles. However, as with CNG, if CARB adopts a RAF of at least 0.5, EPA expects
that the CARB TLEV and LEV NMOG standard will be individually at least as stringent as the federal NMHC standard. 




Alcohol Fuels 



CARB has finalized a RAF of 0.41 for M85 vehicles and EPA's analysis 
indicates that the CARB NMOG standard is individually as protective as the federal NMHC equivalent standard for M85
fuel. However, CARB has not established a RAF for E85 and M100 fuel. EPA thus cannot determine at this time whether the
CARB NMOG standards are individually as protective of public health and welfare as the federal NMHC equivalent standards
for all alcohol-fueled vehicles. 

Regarding THC, methane emissions from alcohol-fueled vehicles, as with 
gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, are generally low enough that vehicles meeting the CARB NMOG standards would
also comply with the federal THC standards. Therefore, EPA concludes that the CARB NMOG standards are individually
at least as stringent as the federal THC standard.

vi. 

Onboard diagnostics. 

The currently waived California onboard diagnostic I (OBD I) regulation is not comparable to the recently promulgated
federal OBD regulation ( 58 FR 9468, February 19, 1993). The recently promulgated federal OBD regulation is comparable
to the recently revised California OBD II regulation. In fact, EPA has decided that vehicles demonstrating compliance
with CARB onboard diagnostic (OBD) regulations will be deemed to satisfy federal OBD requirements through the 1998
model year. 
However, EPA cannot properly consider California's OBD II regulations under section 243(e) of the CAA because California
has not yet received a waiver of federal preemption for them. Thus, in subsequent model years after 1998, vehicle OBD
systems must comply with the federal OBD requirements. 



vii. 

Summary. 

While the basic CFV exhaust standards are identical to CARB standards, EPA is not able to find that each set of currently
waived CARB standards are as protective as the federal standards. By comparison to the federal program established
for CFVs today pursuant to section 242 and 243, the California program lacks comparable components for at least the
federal cold CO standards, recently promulgated evaporative emission standards and on-board diagnostics, as well
as mobile source control for vehicle refueling vapor recovery. Since EPA cannot at this time make the required determination
under section 243(e)(2), EPA is promulgating federal standards and requirements in this final rule that will apply
to CFVs. The CAA exhaust 
standards will apply to clean fuel vehicles, and will be administered and enforced according to CARB practices under
CAA section 244, which is discussed later under ``Administration and Enforcement''. 



Pursuant to section 242(b), federal requirements for cold CO, evaporative 
emissions, refueling emissions, OBD (onboard diagnostics), NMHC, and, with certain exceptions, THC will also apply
to CFVs. As proposed, EPA is waiving testing requirements for the cold CO standards for gaseous-fueled, diesel-fueled
and electric CFVs when manufacturers demonstrate compliance with the cold CO standard through engineering analysis
or test data.
 EPA does not expect problematic cold temperature CO emissions from gaseous-fueled CFVs since they do not generally
use fuel enrichment strategies to aid with cold starts. Because of efficient combustion in diesel-fueled vehicles
and the minimal emissions inherent with electric vehicles, EPA does not expect problematic cold CO emissions from
these vehicles either. Also as 
discussed above, EPA will not require CNG vehicles to meet the THC standard due to the conflict with provisions of part
C of the Act and other factors. 





In the NPRM, EPA had anticipated that the regulatory processes underway 
would allow EPA to conclude at the time of this final rule that each set of California standards is, in the aggregate,
at least as protective of public health and welfare as the otherwise applicable standards set forth in section 242
and 243. The Agency still believes that such a conclusion may be possible in the future. EPA will continue to monitor
developments on these issues and, if changing circumstances warrant, EPA intends to revisit this rule and propose
replacing the federal CFV standards with CARB 
standards under section 243(e)(2). In such a situation, the Agency will supplement the record and provide an opportunity
for comment as appropriate. 



d. 

Credit Generating Standards. 

As mentioned previously, the CAA requires EPA to establish standards for Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) and
Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) which are more stringent than the standards that otherwise apply to CFVs. Section 246(f)(4)
of the CAA states that, ``[t]he standards established by the Administrator under this paragraph for vehicles under
8,500 lbs. GVWR or greater shall conform as closely as 
possible to standards which are established by the State of California for ULEV and ZEV vehicles in the same class''.
As proposed, EPA is promulgating the ULEV and ZEV standards established by CARB in the California LEV program as the
federal ULEV and ZEV standards. Section 249(d)(3) specifies that these and other requirements established for purposes
of the credit program for the Clean Fuel Fleet program shall also apply for purposes of issuing credits in the Pilot
Program.

A ZEV (e.g., an electric vehicle) is defined as a vehicle that complies with the 
applicable ZEV standards (40 CFR 88.101). Like CARB, EPA will determine 
compliance with the ZEV standard through engineering analysis rather than by testing. 
As per section 244 of the CAA, the federal ZEV standards will be administered and 
enforced in accordance with applicable CARB procedures for LDVs and LDTs. 

Consistent with the CARB, EPA is establishing ZEV standards which require 
zero emissions of the following pollutants: NMOG, NO

x

, CO, particulates, and HCHO. 
(Emissions from non-fuel sources, like tires, seats, paint, etc., will likely exist as they 
do for conventional vehicles and other CFVs.) Compliance with this requirement may 
be assessed through engineering analysis. This analysis will include a description and 
analysis of all primary or auxiliary equipment and engines which concludes that no 
emissions of the stated pollutants is possible. The engineering analysis will determine 
that the vehicle fuel system(s) does not contain either carbon or nitrogen compounds 
(including air) which, when burned, form the above regulated exhaust emissions. 
Such criteria will also assure that evaporative emissions will not occur. Emission 
testing will not be necessary. When applicable, compliance testing on ZEVs may be 
performed according to the testing requirements of CFR Part 86 and 88 (Federal Test 
Procedure) at EPA's discretion. As with other CFVs, ZEVs will be subject to the 
standards of part 88 which will be administered per CARB's procedures for LDVs and 
LDTs and which are incorporated by reference. 

Like CARB, EPA will consider a vehicle with an auxiliary heater to be a ZEV if 
the heater will not operate at ambient temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 
the heater's power and/or fuel source does not have any evaporative emissions in 
use. Commenters responding to this issue supported this definition, on which EPA 
requrested comment in the NPRM. This auxiliary heater will not be subject to the cold 
CO standard (contained in 40 CFR Part 86.201-94) because the cold CO regulations 
do not require the testing of heaters. In addition, CARB has provided a specific 
exemption for ZEVs from the CARB cold CO requirements (whether or not the vehicle 
is equipped with an auxiliary heater); thus EPA's action on this issue is consistent with 
CARB's approach. EPA may reconsider subjecting ZEV auxiliary heaters to the 
federal cold CO requirement through regulation if circumstances warrant in the future. 
Any vehicle with additional power system(s) or auxiliary engine(s) that might produce 
regulated pollutants (e.g., a hybrid vehicle or electric vehicle with an auxiliary power 
source to run other vehicle systems) will be subject to the standards of 40 CFR Part 
88 (administered per CARB procedures, which are incorporated by reference) or future 
applicable regulations and might not qualify as a ZEV. One respondent requested that 
EPA establish ZEV exhaust emission standards above zero such that hybrid electric 
vehicles may qualify as ZEVs. EPA has not promulgated a test procedure for such 
vehicles and therefore standards have not been established. 

e. 

Administration and Enforcement Per California Practice. 

As proposed in the NPRM, EPA will administer and enforce the numerical CFV 
exhaust emission standards in the same manner as does the state of California. 
Section 244 of the Act directs EPA to administer and enforce the numerical CFV 
emission standards in the same manner as CARB does for vehicles less than 8,500 
lbs. GVWR. Specifically, section 244 states that when the applicable CAA and CARB numerical standards are the same,






Such standards shall be administered and enforced by the Administrator (1) in 
the same manner and with the same flexibility as the State of California 
administers and enforces corresponding standards * * *; and (2) subject to the 
same requirements, and utilizing the same interpretations and policy judgments, 
as are applicable in the case of such CARB standards, including, but not limited 
to, requirements regarding certification, production-line testing, and in-use 
compliance. 






The application of California administration and enforcement procedures does 
not depend on whether EPA has replaced federal CFV standards with California 
standards under section 243(e). Section 246(f)(4) provides that the credit generating 
standards are to be administered and enforced in the same manner as the other CFV 
standards. Therefore, EPA will administer and enforce the ULEV and ZEV standards 
in the same manner as does CARB.

Section 244 states that EPA shall use California administration and enforcement 
procedures unless EPA determines that doing so will not meet the criteria for a waiver 
of preemption under section 209. EPA believes that the application of current 
California procedures would meet the criteria for a section 209 waiver. However, in a 
letter dated February 17, 1994, CARB requested that EPA waive preemption under 
section 209 for certain proposed amendments to California certification test 
procedures. EPA is currently analyzing this waiver request to determine whether 
these test procedure amendments meet the criteria for a waiver under section 209. 
For example, EPA must determine if the California enforcement procedures, as 
amended, are consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. 

Until it has completed its analysis of the waiver request, EPA cannot present a 
determination that the amended California regulation, and thus California 
administration and enforcement, do not meet the criteria for a waiver under section 
209. Given that section 244 directs EPA to adopt California's procedures unless it 
makes such a determination, EPA believes that it is required to adopt today 
California's administration and enforcement procedures. EPA believes this adoption is 
in accordance with the plain language of section 244. If EPA later determines that the 
California enforcement procedures do not meet the section 209 waiver criteria, it will 
propose to amend its regulation regarding enforcement of CFVs according to 
California procedures. 

California procedures currently require certification testing of gasoline vehicles 
either on California reformulated gasoline or on the current federal gasoline test fuel 
called ``indolene.'' EPA believes that adopting this requirement as a part of adopting 
California administration and enforcement procedures will allow manufacturers to 
certify vehicles both for California as well as the other 49 states. In most cases, EPA 
believes that vehicle designs likely to be certified on California reformulated gasoline 
to the CFV standards will be capable of being certified to those standards on indolene 
as well with no technological changes. 

It is possible that some manufacturers may wish to certify vehicles on a 
gasoline formulation different from either California reformulated gasoline or indolene. 
For example, a manufacturer may wish to certify and market a CFV engine family for 
use by fleet operators only in areas where federal reformulated gasoline requirements 
apply, but where California reformulated gasoline is unavailable or expensive. A CFV 
engine family certified only on California reformulated gasoline would not be an 
attractive option to fleet operators in areas covered by federal reformulated gasoline 
requirements because the vehicles in that family will not have been demonstrated to 
comply with the CFV standards on federal reformulated gasoline. If certifying that 
family to the CFV standards on indolene would require additional emission control 
development effort over the California-fuel version, but certifying on a federal 
reformulated fuel would not, the manufacturer might prefer to certify on a fuel 
representative of federal reformulated gasoline. Thus, such a manufacturer might 
choose to market a line of CFVs which could use the local fuel (reformulated gasoline) 
instead of only marketing California-fuel versions. In this kind of situation, then, 
allowing manufacturers the option of certifying to the CFV standards on other gasoline 
formulations might provide fleets covered by the CFF program with an additional 
vehicle choice, one which may help them comply in a cost-effective manner with the 
requirement that they operate their CFVs in covered areas only on fuels on which the 
vehicles comply with the CFV standards. 

While the California procedures adopted here do not appear to permit 
certification on gasoline different from California reformulated gasoline or indolene, 
EPA is considering whether it has the authority to propose and promulgate a provision 
which would permit manufacturers to request certification on a different gasoline 
formulation. Particularly if interest is shown in such a provision on the part of fleets, 
vehicle manufacturers, fuel producers, states, or other interested parties, EPA may 
issue a proposed rule to permit certification on any gasoline formulation. 

With respect to the NMOG standard, CAA sections 241(3) and 241(4) provide 
definitions for NMOG and base gasoline to be used in determining reactivity 
adjustments for alternative fuels. Section 241(4) further provides that EPA is to modify 
these definitions and the method used for determining reactivity adjustment factors to 
conform to the definitions and method used by CARB, provided CARB's definitions 
are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the CAA 
definitions. CARB's definition of NMOG, contained in the ``definitions'' section of its 
LEV program regulations, is identical to the CAA definition. The CAA section 241(4) 
specifications for ``base gasoline'' for the most part fall within the specification ranges 
for CARB's ``baseline'', i.e., ``conventional'', gasoline used by CARB in establishing the 
RAF for methanol-fueled vehicles.
 Thus, EPA concludes that CARB's regulatory 
definition of ``conventional gasoline'' is at least as protective as the CAA definition of 
base gasoline for determining RAFs. 





To ensure that the administration and enforcement of the CFV exhaust 
emission standards is undertaken in conformance with section 244, EPA incorporates 
by reference CARB's test procedures and other regulatory provisions regarding 
administration and enforcement. (The California Regulatory Requirements Applicable 
to the Clean Fuel Fleet and California Pilot Programs, April 1, 1994, have been 
incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 88.104-94(k)(2).) Any vehicle certified by CARB 
in California to the same CFV exhaust emission standards promulgated today will be 
considered to satisfy the requirements for certification to the federal CFV exhaust 
standards although the vehicle must meet all other Title II requirements as well as 
qualify as a CFV. For federal standards which are not currently identical to CARB 
requirements (e.g., cold CO emissions, evaporative emissions, THC, NMHC), the 
existing federal administration and enforcement provisions, including the applicable test procedures, will apply.

Provisions established in the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program Fees rule (57 FR 30044, July 7, 1992) give
EPA the authority to recover all reasonable costs associated with enforcement and compliance activities performed
by EPA. CFVs certified for use in the Pilot program may be subject to California-only fees if a manufacturer only intends
to sell the CFV in California. However, other CFVs certified under the same process may be subject to fees applicable
for a federal certificate. This would be the case if such CFVs were sold outside of California (e.g., CFVs used in the
CFF program outside California).
As EPA proposed in the NPRM, vehicles certified as CFVs are to be labeled according to CARB's revised motor vehicle
emission control label specifications.
 These revised labeling requirements include labeling vehicles to designate that they meet LEV, ULEV or ZEV standards.





2. Heavy-Duty Clean-Fuel Vehicle Standards


Today's rule requires that engines intended for use in clean-fuel vehicles greater than 8,500 and up to 26,000 pounds
GVWR meet a combined non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) plus NO

X

 emissions standard of 3.8 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/Bhp-hr). This new standard applies to all light
and medium heavy-duty engines which are to be certified for inclusion in the Clean Fuel Fleet program, independent
of fuel type. (Also, this standard applies to heavy heavy-duty engines participating in the Clean Fuel Fleet program
for the purpose of generating credits.) Thus, it applies to vehicles operating on gasoline, diesel, alcohols, gaseous
fuels, electricity, and other fuels.
Section 246(f)(4) of the CAA requires that credit-generating standards be promulgated for heavy-duty clean-fuel
vehicles, including standards for heavy-duty ULEVs and ZEVs. The CAA requires these standards to be ``comparable'',
which EPA interprets to mean comparable to the credit-generating standards established for light-duty vehicles.
a. 

The Heavy-Duty Clean Fuel Vehicle Low-Emission Vehicle NMHC+NO

X

 

Standard.

 Section 245 of the CAA sets forth the statutory framework governing establishment of the heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicle
standards. Section 245(a) sets a combined NMHC+NO

X

 standard of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr for engines intended for use in heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, reflecting a 50 percent
reduction from the current combined HC and NO

X

 standards for heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDE). Section 245(b) permits EPA to set a less stringent standard or standards
if EPA determines that the statutory level of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is infeasible for clean diesel-fueled engines. Under
this provision, EPA must make a determination as to the feasibility of this standard for clean diesel-fueled engine
technology, taking into account ``durability, costs, lead time, safety, and other relevant factors.'' If the Administrator
determines that the standard is not feasible for clean diesel-fueled engines, EPA may set a less stringent standard
so long as it is at least a 30 percent reduction from the combined NMHC plus NO

X

 standards for model year 1994 heavy-duty engines. A 30 percent reduction would be equivalent to a NMHC plus NO

X

 standard of 4.41 g/Bhp-hr.
EPA determines today that a combined NMHC+NO

X

 emission standard of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is infeasible for clean diesel-fueled engines, for the reasons discussed below.
Under Section 245(b)(1), EPA has the authority to establish a less stringent standard. The only statutory criteria
for setting the less stringent standard is the requirement that the standard require at least a 30 percent reduction
from the combined NMHC+NO

X

 standards for the 1994 model year heavy-duty engines. Because the same standard that will apply to diesel-fueled
vehicles will also apply to vehicles run on other fuels (including gasoline), EPA has looked at feasibility for both
diesel- and nondiesel-fueled vehicles. Based on these considerations, EPA has decided to set the standard at 3.8
g/Bhp-hr.
(i) 

Establishing the NMHC+NO

X

 

Standard.

 In determining whether the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 standard is feasible for clean diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines, EPA believes that the CAA does not require a determination
that the standard is feasible for every diesel engine family, but rather that it is feasible for at least enough diesel
engine families such that fleet operators have enough choice to meet their requirements under the Clean Fuel Fleet
Program. The clean-fuel vehicle standard is not a mandatory national standard for all heavy-duty vehicles manufactured,
but instead applies to vehicles that fleet owners in certain areas must buy as a certain percentage of their vehicle
purchases beginning in model year 1998.

In the NPRM, EPA proposed a level of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 based on concerns about technology, cost, leadtime, and durability for diesel engines as prescribed in section 245
(b) of the CAA. Based on the comments submitted to EPA and further analysis by the Agency, EPA believes that achieving
HDDE emission levels below about 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 would be technically difficult and costly to manufacturers and would not be achievable for an adequate number of light
and medium heavy-duty diesel engine families by 1998. In their comments, engine manufacturers argued that the 3.15
g/Bhp-hr level, as well as the proposed 3.5 g/Bhp-hr level, would not be technologically and economically feasible
for diesel-fueled engines. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) argued that the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr level would be
feasible for diesel-fueled engines, based largely on a final report by Acurex under contract with CARB, entitled
``Technical Feasibility Reducing NO

X

 and Particulate Emissions from Heavy-Duty Engines.''
 As the analysis summarized below demonstrates, EPA agrees in part with each set of comments, but reaches a conclusion
different from both.




As a part of its assessment of the potential HDDE emission control technology, EPA studied the Acurex report in depth.
Like the Regulatory Support Document associated with this rule,
 this report concludes that to achieve a NO

X

-emission level of 2.5 g/Bhp-hr by 2000 (NO

X

 levels needed to meet a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 standard),
 diesel-fueled engines would need to be equipped with advanced catalytic trap or EGR (exhaust gas recirculation)
technologies. In addition, the 2.5 g/Bhp-hr level would also require the use of a combination of some or all of the following
emission control approaches for diesel-fueled engines: very high pressure fuel injection, variable geometry turbocharging,
air-to-air aftercooling, optimized combustion, electronic unit injections with minimized sac volumes, optimized
fuel injection nozzles, rate shaping, exhaust gas recirculation and sophisticated electronic control of all engine
systems. Most of the devices described in the Acurex report are in relatively early stages of development and would
require extensive changes in heavy-duty diesel-powered engines compared to today's designs. Acurex projects that
achieving this level would be possible, but it would result in a 5 percent fuel economy penalty and a doubling of the
engine price of a 1994 diesel-fueled engine. Based on reasons discussed throughout this section, EPA is very doubtful
that this standard could be met in a cost-effective manner in time for the production of an adequate number of 1998 model
year engine families. However, Acurex has projected that a 3.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

X

-emission level (approximately equivalent to a 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 level) is achievable for diesel-fueled engines by 1999 with the addition of EGR and oxidation catalyst technology
without major new costs or fuel economy penalties.





Also, the NGVC argued that no technological breakthroughs are required to meet the 3.15 standard since each one of
these technologies is already in use in one or more commercial diesel engine families to meet the 1994 and 1998 standards.
They also state that all that would be required to meet the 3.15 standard would be the addition of EGR and possibly a particulate
trap. Although it is true that some versions of the necessary technologies are in use today, EPA believes, as stated
above, that the additional development effort needed to reach very low emission levels would be very costly and would
likely limit or eliminate the availability of heavy-duty diesel engines for the program.

Furthermore, a review of the 1993 HDE federal certification results clarifies the magnitude of the developmental
task for manufacturers to achieve extremely low- emission levels, especially for diesels. The data, which represents
engines tested on federal certification fuel, indicates that no current gasoline or diesel HDE family meets or is
close to the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr standard on federal certification fuel (for diesel and gasoline engines NMHC and HC are
roughly equivalent). Of the 9 gasoline HDE families certified in 1993, three are within one g/Bhp-hr of the standard
(see Figure 1). Based on the aftertreatment control technology used by and available for gasoline engines, EPA believes
that 3.15 g/Bhp-hr level would be within reach for a number of these families. For diesel engines, however, the 1993
heavy-duty engine federal certification results presented in Figure 1 indicate that achieving the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr
standard on federal diesel fuel would be extremely problematic for the majority of engine families by 1998. However,
five of the 37 diesel engine families certified in 1993 are within one g/Bhp-hr of the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 level (equivalent to NO

X

-certification level of 3.0 g/Bhp-hr), indicating that a standard in this range would more likely be achieved by a
variety of diesel engines on federal certification fuel than would the 3.15 level. Only one of 37 diesel engine families
certified in 1993 is within one g/Bhp-hr of the 3.15 level; most have combined HC and NO

X

 certification levels of 5.5 g/Bhp-hr or less.



















There are two existing sets of regulations that will drive heavy-duty engine technology towards low NMHC+NO

X

 levels: the federal 1998 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

X

 standard, and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty
vehicles of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

. EPA received many comments in Docket A-91-28 stating that the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

X

 standard for all 1998 and later HDEs, which is one g/Bhp-hr lower than the existing standard, is feasible for diesel
engines. Development of the technology necessary to comply with the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

X

 standard will make it more likely that a significant number of light and medium diesel HDE families will be able to reach
emission levels slightly below 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

X

 on federal diesel fuel in the future, but it is unlikely that this federal standard will force the development of technologies
needed to achieve a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

X

 standard on such fuel (i.e., NO

X

 levels of 3.0 g/Bhp-hr or less) since there is no federal requirement to reach lower levels.

CARB's 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 standard is the only other impetus driving technology to achieve emission levels significantly below the 4.0 g/Bhp-hr
NO

x

 standard. Engine manufacturers have stated that the CARB 1998 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 standard for incomplete medium-duty vehicles and diesel engines is feasible, and EPA agrees with CARB's expectation
that manufacturers will market a range of LEV diesel HDEs in California which will meet the California standard. However,
as with the federal 4.0 g/Bhp-hr NO

x

 standard, it is unlikely the current California standard will prompt the additional technology development needed
to reach a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 level since there is no requirement to reach levels below 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

. This is especially true for engines intended for vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 pounds GVWR, which are covered
by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program but not the current CARB LEV program. 
EPA believes it is appropriate to look at the demand that will be created for heavy-duty CFVs as a relevant factor when
determining whether a particular combined NMHC+NO

x

 standard for diesel-fueled vehicles is technologically feasible under section 245(b)(1). For the reasons discussed
above, EPA believes that achieving a level of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 for even a small selection of HDDEs by 1998 will be a very difficult task. Manufacturers will need to invest significantly
in research and accelerated technology development, and any engines which reach production would be more costly
(in terms of both engine price increase and fuel economy penalty, as discussed above), especially based on the relatively
small demand that will be created by the Clean Fuel Fleet Program. In the absence of mandated production, EPA believes
that a technological effort of this magnitude is likely to be undertaken by engine manufacturers only under circumstances
of a certain, substantial market. 
The CFF program contains no authority for a production mandate. Thus, the size and certainty of the market is central
to whether diesel engines will be developed to meet the requirements of heavy-duty fleets covered by the fleet program.
However, only a small number of vehicles will be needed by fleets for their fleet program purchase requirements. For
example, during each year of the fleet program EPA estimates that a maximum of only about 2 percent (10,000) of total
nationwide new heavy-duty diesel vehicles will be purchased by fleet operators to meet the Clean Fuel Fleet Program
requirements.
 This projected market decreases by about 25 percent if California opts out of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program; other potential
opt outs by additional states may reduce the market to under one percent of nationwide heavy-duty diesel engine sales
(or under about 5000 vehicles). By comparison, based on 
the implementation schedule of CARB's LEV program, the annual market (30,000) for vehicles required to meet CARB's
LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium duty-vehicles of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 is approximately three to six times as large as the potential federal clean diesel-fueled market.
 CARB's program incorporates a phased-in percentage sales mandate for this larger number of vehicles. 





EPA is concerned that a market of the size represented by the CFF program 
will not be seen as sufficient for engine manufacturers to justify the major voluntary technological development
efforts necessary to reach a 3.15 g/Bhp-hr standard. Even if some manufacturers do launch such an effort, the likely
higher cost and possible fuel economy penalty may make it much more difficult for diesel engine producers to compete
for sales with gasoline or alternative fueled engine options which may be available. Since developing and producing
vehicles for the fleet program is, by statute, voluntary, the Agency believes that it is very possible that, with a
very low emission standard, no diesels will be produced for the clean fuel fleet program. The Act is clear in its intention
that EPA may design the fleet program such that clean diesel vehicles can participate. EPA thus concludes that a standard
of 3.15 g/Bhp-hr is not feasible for heavy-duty diesel-fueled CFVs taking into account costs, lead time, durability,
and other relevant factors, and should not be promulgated at this time. 
EPA reserves the right to reconsider through rulemaking the 3.15 g/Bhp-hr NMHC+NO

x

 standard at a later time if diesel NO

x

 control technology and the HD clean-fuel engine market develop to a point which would make this level feasible for
heavy-duty diesel-fueled CFVs. Such a reconsideration may be prompted by developments in the ongoing CARB HD LEV
program now under consideration. 
ii. 

NMHC+NO

x

 

LEV standard.

 EPA is adopting an approach for the heavy-duty clean fuel vehicle engine standard that is very similar to the proposed
approach. The intent of this approach is to implement a challenging standard in a way that harmonizes as completely
as possible the federal standard with CARB's NMHC+NO

x

 LEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty vehicles. The Agency believes that the effect of this
harmonization is to make the overall national market for clean HDDs significantly larger than it would be with either
program alone and will thus assure that clean diesels will in fact be produced by 1998 for the clean fuel fleet program.

To meet these objectives, EPA is promulgating a combined NMHC+NO

x

 
clean-fuel engine emission standard of 3.8 g/Bhp-hr for heavy-duty engines certified on federal diesel certification
fuel. Manufacturers may also certify heavy-duty engines to a standard of 3.5 g/Bhp-hr on California diesel certification
fuel, which for a given engine is approximately equal in stringency to the 3.8 g/Bhp-hr standard using federal diesel
certification fuel, as described below. The level of stringency represented by these standards should be achievable
for at least several diesel engines with fairly straightforward technological improvements and without a serious
fuel economy penalty. EPA intends for this approach to assure that the same engines that are developed and produced
for the California LEV program will also be acceptable to fulfill the requirements of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program.
These vehicles and engines would, as specified by section 242(b) of the Act, also be required to meet all other applicable
emission standards and requirements of 40 CFR Part 86 (such as standards for CO, particulates, smoke and evaporative
emissions, as applicable). 
As discussed in the NPRM, EPA recognizes that differences between California and federal certification and in-use
diesel fuels may cause a difference in emission rates. CARB limits the aromatics content of the test fuel to a maximum
of ten percent, while federal test fuel may contain as much as 35 percent aromatics. There is evidence to suggest that
the use of federal test fuel can result in higher NMHC+NO

X

 emissions than the use of CARB fuel in the same engine. Apparently, this occurs because the higher aromatic content
of the fuel reduces its cetane rating and thus combustion is slightly less enhanced. Data reported in the NPRM for a
1991 prototype DDC Series 60 heavy heavy-duty engine showed this difference to be in the range of 0.3 g/Bhp-hr offset.

In addition to the analysis of the 1991 prototype heavy-duty diesel engine 
referenced in the NPRM, EPA has used a similar analysis to examine diesel fuel 
effects based on data presented in a study performed on a 1993 prototype Navistar 
Diesel DTA 466 medium heavy-duty engine.
 As had been done in the earlier 
analysis, EPA compared federal and California diesel fuels on the basis of aromatic 
percent and cetane number. EPA used the specified aromatic levels of 10 percent for 
California test fuel and 35 percent for federal test fuel and natural cetane numbers of 
50 and 46 for typical California and federal certification fuels, respectively.
 An API 
gravity number typical of both test fuels of 36 degrees was used. The following 
regression equations were developed in the study conducted on the 1993 engine for 
total hydrocarbon (THC) and NO

X

:





THC [g/Bhp-hr] = 0.819 ^ 0.01942 * (Natural Cetane) + 0.01159 * (API) 
NO

X

 [g/Bhp-hr] = 6.593 + 0.01183 * (SFC Aromatics %) ^ 0.02497 * (Natural Cetane) ^ 0.02365 (API) 



Substituting the values selected above for percent aromatics and cetane 
numbers into these equations, the Agency calculated a THC + NO

X

 offset of about 9.7 
percent. Applying this percent offset to the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard for CARB diesel 
fuel, the Agency analysis calculated that the offset would be about 0.34 g/Bhp-hr THC 
+ NO

X

. (This analysis assumed that the offset would apply equally whether THC or 
NMHC was being considered; the Agency has no data to indicate that the small 
methane emissions component in diesel emissions would affect the relative behavior 
of the engine on the two fuels). 
Thus, the Agency concludes that diesel engines certified to a 3.5 g/Bhp-hr level 
on California diesel fuel would for typical engines, result in emissions of approximately 
3.8 g/Bhp-hr for the same engines operated on federal diesel fuel, confirming the 
estimate made in the NPRM. In their comments engine manufacturers quoted the 
same data that EPA has used for the 1991 and 1993 prototype diesel engines, but 
used different assumptions for the cetane number for in-use diesel fuel. Also, the 
industry analysis did not adjust the offset proportionally to account for the much lower 
emissions of CFVs as compared to the current engine which generated the test data. 
In their comments, they concluded that the offset between federal certification fuel and 
California certification fuel may be more in the range of 0.55-0.66 g/Bhp-hr. EPA 
has examined the assumptions used in the industry analysis and concluded that the 
EPA analysis is a more appropriate approach for determining the expected emissions 
offset. While this conclusion is based on data from a single engine, the 1993 engine 
is of the appropriate size (medium heavy-duty) from which to draw a conclusion for 
this program and the study was done on a meaningful array of diesel test fuels. It is 
likely that if similar data were collected on other engines, somewhat different values 
for the CARB/federal fuel offset might be observed. Until such a time when additional 
data becomes available, EPA will assume that offsets for other heavy-duty diesel 
engines would range on either side of the 0.34 g/bhp-hr level EPA has developed for 
the 1993 engine. Thus, the Agency believes that its analysis reasonably accounts for 
potential fuel variability and that the 0.34 g/Bhp-hr value represents a reasonable 
estimate for the average emissions offset between federal certification fuel and 
California certification fuel. If a reduction catalyst is used as a means to reduce NO

X

 
levels, concerns over fuel variability diminish significantly. The CARB/federal fuel 
offset would tend to be less because the reduction catalyst would reduce emissions 
proportionally for both fuels. While the use of reduction catalysts may not be 
universal, EPA expects that some light/medium heavy-duty engine families will use 
reduction catalyst technology to meet the NO

X

 target level. Additional data and 
analysis supporting the above conclusion of the offset between federal and California 
diesel fuel can be found in the Summary and Analysis of Comments document for this 
rulemaking. 

Based on its analysis of the emissions offset above, EPA has set the emission 
standard for HDD CFVs certified on federal diesel fuel at 3.8 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO

X

. 
This standard is consistent with EPA's intent that the heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicle 
standards be of as close to equivalent stringency as possible to the CARB LEV 
standard for similar vehicles to assure the production of an adequate number of diesel 
engine models for the clean fuel fleet program. Further, because the Agency is 
reasonably confident that in-use emissions of a engine certified at 3.5 g/Bhp-hr on 
California fuel will emit in the range of 3.8 g/Bhp-hr on federal fuel, EPA will grant a 
federal certificate of conformity to a manufacturer which demonstrates compliance with 
the 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard on California certification fuel. While it is possible that 
individual engines certified on California fuel may experience a slightly different offset 
when operated on federal diesel fuel (e.g., when a cetane number is much different 
between the fuels), EPA believes that this will be the exception and that in-use 
performance on federal diesel fuel will average about 3.8 g/Bhp-hr. The use of federal 
fuel in engines certified on California fuel is consistent in this case with the fuel use 
provisions of sections 246(b) and 241(2), since EPA has concluded that such engines 
indeed comply with the clean fuel vehicle requirements on federal diesel fuel.

As another way of harmonizing the CARB LEV program and the CFF program 
to ensure a sufficient number of HDDEs will be available by 1998 for the fleet 
program, EPA will only test engine families which were certified to CFV standards on 
California diesel fuel on diesel fuel meeting California specifications during any 
Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) testing or in-use recall enforcement testing. The 
Agency believes that if manufacturers of HD CFVs certified on California fuel perceive 
that their engines may be subject to later EPA testing on federal diesel fuel, then they 
may desire to perform additional testing of these engines on federal certification diesel 
fuel for the purpose of assuring themselves of in-use compliance on federal diesel 
fuel. This approach to SEA and in-use recall testing should assure manufacturers that 
they will not need to perform any additional testing at certification beyond that required 
for California certification. Fuel meeting California diesel test fuel specifications is an 
acceptable test fuel under the FTP because it meets the federal fuel specifications. 
This policy of the Agency using fuel meeting California diesel test fuel specifications 
for SEA and recall testing applies only to CFVs. If the Agency becomes aware of 
changed circumstances which indicate that this policy is inappropriate, the Agency 
reserves the right to discontinue this policy. 
For gasoline-fueled HD CFVs, EPA is aware of no evidence to suggest any 
significant difference in emissions between such vehicles operating on federal and 
California certification gasolines; thus the technical basis for separate standards which 
exists for diesels does not apply for gasoline engines. Commenters did not respond 
to the issue of the appropriateness of a single standard for all HDEs. However, EPA 
believes that in general, a single standard for all fuels provides equity among 
manufacturers of different types of engines for this program. Also, section 245 of the 
Act seems to indicate that Congress intended for there to be a single heavy-duty CFV 
standard. Therefore, as for diesel engines, EPA today also promulgates a standard of 
3.8 g/Bhp-hr for gasoline clean-fuel vehicle engines certified on federal gasoline test 
fuel. As with diesel engines, gasoline engines demonstrating compliance with the 
California 3.5 g/Bhp-hr standard on California gasoline certification fuel will be eligible 
for a federal certificate. 
Given the arguments above, as well as the fact that manufacturers have more 
than three years before the purchase requirements for clean-fuel fleet vehicles begin, 
EPA believes that several heavy-duty diesel engine families will achieve a standard of 
3.8 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO

X

 on federal certification fuel or 3.5 g/Bhp-hr NMHC + NO

X

 
on California certification fuel by the 1998 model year. Also, EPA believes that most 
gasoline-fueled HDE families can meet a standard of either 3.8 g/Bhp-hr on federal 
certification fuel or 3.5 g/Bhp-hr on California fuel by the 1998 model year. These 
clean fuel vehicle standards will apply to HDEs used in clean-fuel fleet vehicles of 
8,501 to 26,000 lbs. GVWR to meet the purchase requirements of the fleet program. 


b. Heavy-Duty ULEV and ZEV Standards. 


As previously discussed, section 246(f)(4) of the CAA requires EPA to 
promulgate emission standards for ULEVs and ZEVs, for the purpose of determining 
fleet program credits. The provision states that the standards: 



* * * shall be more stringent than those otherwise applicable to clean-fuel 
vehicles under this part* * * . The standards* * *for [light-duty] vehicles* * *shall

conform as closely as possible to standards which are established by the 
State of California for ULEV and ZEV vehicles in the same class. For 
vehicles of 8,500 lbs. GVWR or more, the Administrator shall promulgate 
comparable standards for purposes of this subsection. 




EPA interprets this comparability criteria to mean that ULEV and ZEV standards 
for heavy-duty engines should require approximately the same percentage of emission 
reduction compared to heavy-duty CFV LEV standards as light-duty CFV ULEV and 
ZEV standards require compared to light-duty CFV LEV standards. Under this 
provision, EPA must determine the appropriate level for the heavy-duty ULEV and 
ZEV standards. EPA proposed this interpretation and did not receive any comments 
objecting to it. 
EPA also believes it is appropriate to take California's ULEV and ZEV 
standards into consideration and attempt to harmonize the federal and California 
standards where possible. As mentioned above in the section pertaining to the 
feasibility of the HD CFV LEV standard, EPA believes such harmonization is valuable 
because it helps create a single larger market for heavy-duty ULEVs and ZEVs rather 
than two smaller markets. A single larger market makes it more economical for 
manufacturers to produce heavy-duty ULEVS and ZEVs, which makes it more likely 
that manufacturers will choose to produce vehicles that can participate in the federal 
program. (The federal program does not have a sales mandate for manufacturers, so 
their participation is voluntary and controlled, in part, by market demand for their 
products.)

<TEXT>
 

EPA also believes it has authority to consider harmonization of federal 
heavy-duty ULEV and ZEV standards and California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV and ZEV standards
in setting the federal standards.
 As explained above, EPA interprets ``comparable standards'' to mean that heavy-duty CFV ULEV and ZEV standards must
be comparable to light-duty CFV ULEV and ZEV standards. Since the Act requires EPA to establish federal light-duty
ULEV and ZEV standards that conform as closely as possible to California's light-duty ULEV and ZEV standards, harmonization
of the federal heavy-duty ULEV and ZEV standards and California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine
ULEV and ZEV standards could be part of the comparability determination. In addition, the direction of section 246(h)
to set ``comparable standards'' gives EPA some discretion in establishing standards. EPA believes it is appropriate
to consider California's standards in exercising this discretion. EPA believes that, since the federal HD ULEV and
ZEV standards are voluntary credit-generating standards, their intended purpose is primarily to provide compliance
flexibility for manufacturers and fleet operators. The Agency's goal then, in selecting these standards, is to provide
the maximum flexibility allowable under section 
246(f)(4) of the Act, while ensuring that there will be no negative impacts on the environment. 






i. Ultra low-emission vehicle standards. EPA is adopting standards for heavy-duty ULEVs NMHC+NO

X

, CO, particulate, and formaldehyde emissions as specified below in Table 5. These standards are the same as those
that were proposed, except the formaldehyde standard, which is lower than originally proposed. In the opening statement
at the public hearing for the proposal and in a memorandum that was placed in the docket and distributed at the public
hearing,
 EPA informed the public that the proposed standard for formaldehyde was a typographical error and requested comment
on the change of the heavy-duty ULEV standard to the level specified in Table 5. EPA did not receive any comments objecting
to this level for the formaldehyde ULEV standard. The final heavy-duty ULEV standards require reductions in emissions
that are comparable to the respective emission reductions required of light-duty ULEVs, and are consistent with
the respective requirements of the California LEV program. 





As proposed, EPA is setting a combined NMHC + NO

X

 HD CFV ULEV standard that is approximately a 30 percent reduction from the HD CFV LEV standard. 
The comparable light-duty CFV ULEV standards require reductions from light-duty CFV LEV standards of 38 to 50 percent
of NMOG emissions and 45 to 50 percent for NO

X

 emissions. Even though EPA has separate NMOG and NO

X

 standards for light-duty CFV ULEVs, the Agency does not believe it is required to establish such separate standards
for heavy-duty CFV ULEVs. Rather, EPA believes it is appropriate to have a combined NMHC + NO

X

 heavy-duty CFV ULEV standard because heavy-duty CFV LEV standards have a combined NMHC + NO

X

 standard rather than separate NMOG and NO

X

 standards (as do light-duty CFV LEVs and ULEVs). 
Furthermore, a combined NMHC + NO

X

 standard is consistent with the California incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV standard. EPA
proposed this interpretation and did not receive any comments objecting to a combined NMHC + NO

X

 standard for HDEs. 

EPA also is setting specific emission standards for CO and particulates that require a reduction in emissions from
the heavy-duty CFV LEV standards of 50 to 54 percent and 50 percent, respectively, as proposed. (For both CO and particulates,
heavy-duty CFV LEVs must meet the same standards as do conventional heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, for these standards,
the reductions in emissions for heavy-duty CFV ULEV standards are the same whether they are compared to conventional
or CFV LEV heavy-duty standards.) The comparable light-duty CFV ULEV standards require reductions in CO and particulate
emissions of 50 percent each from light-duty CFV LEV standards. These federal heavy-duty ULEV standards are identical
to California's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV standards. 

Finally, EPA is also setting a specific heavy-duty ULEV standard for formaldehyde. The comparable light-duty CFV
ULEV standard requires a reduction in emissions ranging from 39 to 52 percent from light-duty CFV LEV standards. Though
formaldehyde is not regulated for heavy-duty CFV LEVs, formaldehyde is regulated in the light-duty CFV ULEV standards.
EPA believes that heavy-duty vehicles that emit formaldehyde are likely to participate in the CFV ULEV program. Because
emissions of formaldehyde are of significant concern to EPA and to Congress, as evidenced by the inclusion of formaldehyde
standards for light-duty CFV LEVs and the inclusion of formaldehyde as a hazardous air pollutant, EPA believes it
is appropriate to include standards for formaldehyde emissions in the heavy-duty CFV ULEV program. EPA has the authority
to regulate formaldehyde emissions not only under section 246(f)(4), but also under CAA sections 202(a) and 301(a).
Also, the CARB LEV program includes a formaldehyde ULEV standard for diesel engines and incomplete medium-duty vehicles.
Therefore, it is consistent with the CARB LEV program to set a formaldehyde standard for federal HD ULEVs. The standard
promulgated today is identical to CARB's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ULEV formaldehyde standard.

<TEXT>
 





Based on the Acurex report, Regulatory Support Document, and comments 
received from the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, EPA believes that alternative fuel vehicle technology will be available
to meet these standards by 1998, and that gasoline and diesel engines may also be able to achieve these ULEV levels by
that time or shortly thereafter. In any event, covered fleet operators are never required to purchase ULEVs to meet
the requirements of the fleet program. 

ii. 

Zero-emission vehicle standards. 

Zero-emission vehicles (e.g. electric vehicles) are vehicles which have no emissions of the pollutants of concern.
Therefore, as proposed, EPA today establishes heavy-duty ZEV standards of zero for NMHC + NO

X

, CO, particulates, and formaldehyde. (Emissions from non-fuel sources (e.g. tires, seats, paint, etc.) will likely
exist as they do for conventional vehicles and other CFVs.) These final heavy-duty ZEV standards each require a 100
percent reduction in emissions from the heavy-duty LEV standards, which for each pollutant is comparable to the respective
emission reductions required of light-duty CFV ZEVs. Furthermore, these federal ZEV standards are identical to
California's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ZEV standards. 

Compliance with the ZEV standards may be assessed through engineering analysis, which shall include a description
and analysis of all primary or auxiliary equipment and engines which concludes that no emissions of the stated pollutants
is possible. The engineering analysis must determine that the vehicle fuel system(s) does not contain either carbon
or nitrogen compounds (including air) which, when burned, form the above regulated exhaust emissions. Such criteria
will also assure that evaporative emissions will not occur. Given these criteria there is no need to perform emission
testing because the above pollutants cannot be emitted from the vehicle. However, compliance for ZEVs may be assessed
through testing by performing the tests required by Parts 86 and 88 (Federal Test Procedure) when applicable.

<TEXT>
 

Any vehicle with additional power system(s) or auxiliary engine(s) that might produce regulated pollutants (e.g.
hybrid vehicle or an electric vehicle with an auxiliary power source to run other vehicle systems) will be subject
to the testing requirements of Part 86 or Part 88 or future applicable regulations and might not qualify as a ZEV. A ZEV
with a heater will be considered a ZEV as long as the heater will not operate at an ambient temperature above 40
 F and the heater's power/fuel source does not have evaporative emissions in use.

c. 

Other Issues

_i. 

Flexible- and Dual-Fuel HDEs. 

EPA is not promulgating a set of emission standards for flexible- and dual-fuel heavy-duty vehicles. (Flexible-
and dual-fuel vehicles are also commonly referred to as variable- and bi-fuel vehicles, respectively.) Section
243(d) of the Act prescribes emission standards for flexible- and dual-fueled light-duty vehicle and light-duty
trucks. EPA is establishing these standards today (see II.A.1.a). The directive of section 243(g) that ``nothing
in this section shall apply to heavy-duty engines'' makes it clear that section 243(d) does not require EPA to establish
flexible- and dual-fueled standards for heavy-duty engines.

Even if EPA has authority to promulgate such standards (a question which we do not answer here), EPA does not think it
is appropriate to exercise that authority at this time. As Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition suggested in their comments,
it is possible that similar standards could be implemented for HDEs in the same manner as prescribed in the statute
for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. However, as described in the proposal, separate NMHC standards are
not necessary for flexible- or dual-fuel HDEs since similar behavior of NMHC (or the equivalent (NMHCE)) would be
expected for all fuel types. In addition, as discussed above, heavy-duty vehicles operated on conventional gasoline
and diesel fuel will be able to comply with the CFV standards by 1998, and thus, there is not a compelling technical reason
to have slightly higher standards for the vehicle when it is operated on clean alternative fuel. For all these reasons,
EPA is not adopting separate standards for flexible- or dual-fuel HDEs.

Section 241(2) defines clean alternative fuel for flexible- or dual-fuel vehicles and engines as the fuel(s) on which
such vehicles are certified to the CFV standards. EPA concludes from this statutory language that engines certified
on California gasoline or diesel fuel only will need to operate exclusively on that fuel in covered nonattainment
areas. (For single-fuel vehicles and engines, section 241(2) requires operation in covered areas on the fuel(s)
on which they ``comply'' with the CFV standards. As discussed above, EPA has determined that single-fuel HDEs certified
on California gasoline or diesel fuel comply with the HD CFV standard on federal fuels.)

ii. 

Optional LDT Certification. 

For a number of years, manufacturers have had the option of certifying their HDEs used in vehicles between 8501 and
10,000 lbs. GVWR using the LDT emission standards and provisions. This provision is found in 40 CFR 86.085-1(b).
EPA finds no reason why the treatment of CFVs should be different than conventional vehicles in this regard, and thus
for consistency EPA will also make this option available for clean-fuel HDEs.

iii. 

Heavy-duty test procedures. 

While this action establishes NMHC + NOx standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines, EPA regulations historically
have not included test procedures for the measurement of methane separate from other hydrocarbons, and thus the calculation
of NMHC emissions would not have been possible. Prior to today's regulations the heavy-duty test procedures only
measured the total amount of hydrocarbons (including methane), but did not separately measure the amount of any individual
hydrocarbons such as methane. Therefore, EPA is promulgating additional test procedures for the separate measurement
of methane and calculation methods for NMHC emissions, as discussed below. Test procedures for measurement of total
hydrocarbon (THC) emissions will be unchanged, and EPA will continue the current practice of using a flame ionization
detector (FID) for THC measurement.

<TEXT>
 

The test procedures call for the separate measurement of methane using gas chromatography
 as specified in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practice J1151. This is consistent with both
the previously established EPA procedure for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks (40 CFR 86.111-94
and 40 CFR 86.140-94), and the California procedure for methane measurement. This approach does not permit
continuous methane measurement of exhaust samples and will require that a bag sample be collected for all classes
of vehicles and engines. (The SAE Recommended Practice J1151 is incorporated by reference in sections 86.111-94(b)(3)(vii)
and 86.1311-94(b)(2)(iii) of the regulatory text and is available in EPA Air Docket A-92-30.) 





Under the approach for measuring NMHC, THC will first be measured using the FID. Then, methane will be measured using
gas chromatography. This methane measurement will then be multiplied by a ``FID response factor.'' This response
factor is necessary because the FID responds differently to methane than it does to other hydrocarbons. In order to
find what portion of the FID's THC reading is attributable to methane, the tester must know the relationship between
the FID response to other hydrocarbons and to methane. Such a ``FID response factor'' is calculated by noting the response
of the FID, calibrated for typical HCs, to a known quantity of methane. For example, if a sample known to be 10.0 grams
of methane gives a FID reading of 11.0 grams, then the FID response factor is 11.0/10.0 or 1.10. The mass of NMHC is then
the difference between the THC (as measured by the FID) and the methane (as measured by gas chromatography), multiplied
by the FID response factor. 

For natural gas vehicles (NGVs), the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and the American Gas Association suggested that
the EPA adopt the CARB method of direct measurement of NMHC by gas chromatography. This issue was also raised in response
to the Gaseous Fuels Rule NPRM (proposed in November, 1992), and EPA has addressed all concerns related to the measurement
of NMHC emissions for NGVs in the subsequent Gaseous Fuels FRM. The NMHC measurement method promulgated in this section
is the same as the method established in the Gaseous Fuels FRM. If the NMHC measurement procedure for NGVs is revisited
and changed in the future, then any revised method will apply to clean-fuel vehicle testing as well. 

In order to provide manufacturers with additional flexibility, EPA proposes to make the measurement of methane (and
subsequent calculations) optional. Manufacturers would be allowed to measure and report THC emissions for compliance
with the NMHC standards. Since THC emissions are the sum of the methane and NMHC emissions, they will be higher than
the NMHC emissions alone; thus, if the THC emissions are lower than the standard, the NMHC will also be below the standard.
While this option in effect increases the stringency of the standard, some manufacturers may find that the savings
associated with using a simpler test procedure justify certifying under this option. This is especially true for
diesels, where the methane fraction of THC emissions is small. 

iv. 

Averaging, trading, and banking. 

The Agency has previously established an extensive credit exchange program for NO

X

 and PM emissions from heavy-duty engines
. Under this program, a manufacturer can take emissions credits for producing vehicles that are below the applicable
standards, and then use those credits either on its own engines within the same averaging set or to sell to other manufacturers
for use in families in the same averaging set which do not meet the applicable standards (trading). These emission
credits can be used in the year generated or retained for later use (banking). Fleet average emissions are unchanged
by this program. 





It would be inappropriate for a manufacturer to receive certification emission credits for vehicles certified under
part 88 (i.e., CFV LEVs, ULEVs and ZEVs) for participation in the fleet program. The CFV standards are mandatory for
covered fleet vehicle purchases; to also allow manufacturer credits for certification of the same vehicles would
result in less emission reduction than is contemplated in the Act. Thus, CFVs certified under part 88 for use in the
fleet program for either compliance or credit purposes shall be excluded from the manufacturers' credit exchange
program. By contrast, single-fuel engines that are certified under part 86 may not participate in the fleet program
even if their emissions meet CFV standards. Therefore, such engines may generate manufacturer certification credits.
However, dual- and flexible-fuel vehicles certified under part 86 may only be able to generate certification emission
credits based on the least stringent standard to which the vehicle is certified since the manufacturer has no control
of the fuel used by the vehicle owner. 

In order to allow a distinction between engines which are eligible for the fleet program and those that are not, EPA
requires manufacturers to have different engine lables. Those engines labeled under Part 88 must include on the label
an indication that this engine is intended to be part of a clean-fuel vehicle program, and as such, they will be excluded
from the manufacturers' credit exchange programs. Those engines labeled under Part 86 only will not include any indication
on the label that the engine meets any of the emissions requirements of Part 88, and as such, they will be excluded from
all clean-fuel vehicle programs and may be included in a manufacturers' credit exchange programs. EPA will allow
manufacturers to divide a clean-fueled engine family into two engine families, one labeled under Part 88 (the Part
which regulates clean-fuel fleet vehicles) and one labeled under Part 86 (the Part which regulates conventional
vehicles) only. The Agency believes that this approach will prevent ``double counting'' of emissions benefits,
but will still provide the manufacturers flexibility in determining the most cost effective means of complying with
the requirements of Part 86.

Furthermore, EPA has decided not to pursue the proposed Credit Exchange 
Programs for Manufacturers of Heavy-Duty Clean-Fuel Fleet Vehicles. The programs 
appeared to be administratively burdensome with minimal economic and emission 
benefit, and there was no support expressed in the comments for these programs. 

v. 

Labeling.

 Section 86.095-35 of Part 86 requires that all heavy-duty vehicles and engines 
certified by EPA have a permanently affixed label indicating that this vehicle or engine 
meets all of the applicable requirements of Part 86. All heavy-duty LEVs, ULEVs, and 
ZEVs will be required to meet additional labeling requirements so the purchaser (e.g. 
fleet operator) knows the vehicle is a CFV and ``double counting'' of emissions benefits 
by the purchasers or manufacturers of CFVs is prevented as discussed above in the 
Averaging, Banking, and Trading section. Those clean-fuel vehicles and engines that 
are regulated under both Part 86 and Part 88 (e.g., gasoline-fueled vehicles, 
methanol-fueled vehicles) shall meet the standard labeling requirements of Part 86 
with the addition of a statement that this vehicle or engine meets the applicable heavy-duty LEV, ULEV, or ZEV standards.
However, certain clean-fuel vehicles (for instance 
electric vehicles) are regulated under Part 88 but have not yet been regulated under 
Part 86. For these clean-fuel vehicles not yet regulated under Part 86, the 
manufacturer shall affix a permanent label that indicates that the vehicle or engine 
meets the requirements of Part 88 for heavy-duty LEVs, ULEVs, or ZEVs, as 
applicable, but does not necessarily meet the requirements of Part 86. The reason for 
this requirement is to inform the consumer that the vehicle may be used by a fleet 
operator towards meeting the purchase requirements of the Clean Fuel Fleet program, 
but the vehicle is not eligible to be used in the averaging, trading, and banking 
program in Part 86. 



B. Conversions to Clean-Fuel Vehicles 



CAA section 247 states that fleet owners may meet clean-fuel fleet vehicle 
purchase requirements through the conversion of existing or new gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles to clean-fuel
vehicles. A converted CFV will thus be considered a 
new vehicle for the purposes of the Clean Fuel Fleet program, and so it will be eligible 
to meet CFF purchase requirements and to earn credits and TCM exemptions. For 
this purpose, a clean-fuel fleet vehicle (or engine) is one which meets the applicable 
CFV emission standards and other requirements as prescribed in CAA sections 242 
through 245.



1. EPA's General Regulatory Approach for Conversions of Vehicles 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00160 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA today codifies the exemption from tampering liability for conversion of 
gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicles to clean fuel vehicles if the converted vehicles 
comply with the applicable clean fuel vehicle standards and the conversions are 
performed in compliance with EPA's conversion regulations being promulgated today. Section 247(e) states that
such conversions shall not be considered as violations of the tampering prohibition in Section 203(a)(3). 

Since conversions involve changes to vehicles/engines that have previously 
been certified as meeting applicable emission standards, conversions are typically subject to the tampering prohibitions
of CAA section 203(a)(3), which prohibit tampering with emission control devices. The initial guidelines established
by EPA regarding the enforcement of tampering prohibitions are contained in the two documents entitled ``Mobile
Source Enforcement Memorandum No. 1A'', dated June 25, 1974, and ``Fact Sheet: Conversion of Vehicles and Engines
to Operate on Natural Gas or Propane'', dated November 1, 1991. In the 1990 amendments to the CAA, section 203 was amended
to limit the scope of the tampering provisions of section 203(a)(3). As amended, an exemption to the tampering provisions
of section 203(a)(3) is provided where a conventional vehicle is converted ``* * * for use of a clean
alternative fuel and if such vehicle continues to comply with section 202 standards 
when operating on the alternative fuel * * * and if in the case of a clean alternative fuel 
vehicle (as defined by the Administrator), the device or element is replaced upon 
completion of the conversion procedure and such action results in proper functioning 
of the device or element when the motor vehicle operates on a conventional fuel.'' 

In addition to the general exemption for clean fuel conversion from the 
tampering prohibitions, section 247(d) creates a special exemption for conversions 
performed pursuant to EPA's regulations issued under section 247. Thus, if a 
conversion is performed in compliance with the regulations issued today, the 
conversion will not violate the tampering prohibition of section 203(a)(3). For any 
conversions that are not performed in compliance with today's regulations (e.g., 
installation of a not-certified conversion configuration), liability for tampering will be 
determined based on section 203(a). 

Issues related to the conversion of vehicles to alternative fuel use are 
addressed in the NPRM and FRM on gaseous-fueled emission standards, (FRM: published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 21, 1994), hereafter referred to as the Gaseous 
Fuels Rule. The conversion provisions in the Gaseous Fuels Rule apply to all 
conversions regardless of fuel type and hence form the basis for the certification 
procedures established in today's rule for vehicles converted to CFVs except where 
superseded by the requirements of today's rule. The Gaseous Fuels Rule provides 
that a vehicle conversion will not be considered tampering if the vehicle has been 
converted to a configuration which has been certified by EPA as meeting applicable 
emission standards. For vehicles converted to use fuels for which no standards exist, 
the provisions of Memorandum 1A apply, and EPA will not consider a modification to a 
certified emission control 
configuration to be tampering if the emissions from the vehicle are not increased as a 
result of the modification. Consistent with the Gaseous Fuels Rule, today's rule 
provides that in order to be considered clean fuel vehicles, conversion configurations 
of vehicles/engines must include all of the hardware necessary to allow a vehicle to 
operate on a fuel other than the fuel for which the vehicle or engine was originally 
manufactured. 



2. Requirements for Clean Fuel Fleet Vehicle Conversions 



Section 247(b) of the CAA directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing 
conversions of conventional vehicles to CFVs that ``* * * will ensure that a converted 
vehicle will comply with the standards applicable under this part to clean-fuel vehicles.'' 
While the conversion provisions in the Gaseous Fuels Rule will require that emissions 
from converted vehicles meet the applicable emission standards whenever 
manufacturers certify conversion configurations, those provisions are not intended to 
fulfill all of the requirements of section 247 of the CAA. Therefore, in addition to the 
general guidelines for converted vehicles discussed in the section above and in the 
Gaseous Fuels rule, today's rule establishes that certification must be obtained from 
EPA before a converted vehicle can be sold to the public as a clean fuel fleet vehicle. 
The following sections describe the regulations which are promulgated by today's rule 
to satisfy the requirement of section 243(b).

a. 

Responsible parties: certification, warranty and liability provisions for CFV vehicles. 

EPA in today's rule holds that the certifier of the conversion configuration is liable as a manufacturer for purposes
of sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement provisions. Imposing such liability on the certifier is an outgrowth
and systhesis of the two options presented in the proposal. Following is a discussion of the significant advantages
and disadvantages inherent in each of the proposed options, a response to pertinent pubic comments, and the final
approach being promulgated today. 

Section 247(c) states that ``any person who converts conventional vehicles to clean-fuel vehicles * * *
shall be considered a manufacturer for purposes of sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement provisions.'' To
implement this requirement EPA considered two options in the NPRM regarding the definition of the ``person who converts.''


Under the first proposed option, the person(s) who installs a conversion configuration on a vehicle in order to convert
the vehicle into a CFV would be liable as a manufacturer under section 247(c). Thus, a person installing a conversion
kit would be required to obtain a federal certificate of conformity for that conversion configuration. Under the
second proposed option, both the conversion kit manufacturer and the installer of the kit would be liable as manufacturers
under 247(c). In the second option, the kit manufacturer and the installer would both have responsibilities in demonstrating
that a vehicle converted to a CFV complies with the CFV standards and with EPA's regulations promulgated under section
247(b). 

A significant advantage inherent in the first option is that liability is easily assigned and enforcement is less
complicated if a single entity is held accountable for warranting each vehicle's emissions performance and is subject
to production line testing requirements. The existence of such a sole liable party may also make it easier for purchasers
of converted vehicles to seek redress for emissions performance failures under warranty provisions. 

However, EPA believes that the installer may not be the appropriate party on which to focus all liability. Commenters
indicated that the kit manufacturer is in the best position to perform the required certification testing. In addition,
EPA believes that the first proposed option would result in a larger number of certifiers, and multiple certificates
for the same conversion configuration. This would complicate enforcement and warranty actions by increasing the
number or parties against whom such actions would need to be taken. 

Commenters also noted the need for strong warranty and recall provisions in order to increase public confidence in
the performance of converted vehicles. EPA believes that the existence of a large number of certifier-installers,
many of whom may be relatively small businesses with limited financial resources
 will adversely affect the confidence of purchasers of converted vehicles in their ability to pursue warranty claims.






The second option offers the advantage of allowing EPA to hold kit manufacturers legally responsible for some or all
of the certification, production line testing, in-use testing, warranty, and recall requirements. EPA believes
it will be more practical to focus enforcement efforts on kit manufacturers than on installers, given the large number
of installers in relation to the number of kit manufacturers. This option would also allow EPA to distribute the responsibility
for certification, and warranty and recall between a kit manufacturer and installers in a manner consistent with
their abilities and level of involvement in the conversion process. Public comment was generally in support of adopting
this option and favored holding conversion kit manufacturers responsible for in-use emission performance of kit
hardware except where performance failures result from poor installation. 

A significant disadvantage in this approach is that, though EPA could bring an action against either the kit manufacturer
or the installer for any violation of the Act, as both would be jointly and severally liable, factual disputes between
the parties regarding the actual cause of the emission failure could become a complicating factor during an enforcement
action. This could lead to lengthy proceedings between the involved parties which in turn may delay resolution of
emission problems and/or the compensation to vehicle owners for in-use performance problems covered under vehicle
warranty.

The definition of the ``person who converts'' for the purposes of section 247(c) that will be promulgated by today's
rule is as follows. Any entity (kit manufacturer, installer, or other) may apply for a certification for a conversion
configuration and receive a federal certificate of conformity. This certifier will be considered the ``person who
converts'' under section 247(c) and will assume all responsibility as the manufacturer under sections 206 and 207.
If the conversion is performed by an entity other than the certifier, the certifier must provide the installer with
instructions for proper installation, and the installer must follow these instructions. While the certifier is
responsible as the manufacturer, if the installer installs improper equipment or performs a faulty installation,
EPA may hold the installer responsible as well under the tampering provisions of the Act. 

Under this approach a single party, the certifier, will be responsible for 
warranting the vehicle's emissions performance, and liability can easily be assigned for enforcement and warranty
purposes as under the first option considered in the NPRM. In addition, this approach avoids the disadvantages inherent
in the first option by providing industry with the flexibility to determine which business entity is in the best position
to provide EPA with the data necessary for certification and to assume responsibilities as the manufacturer. Based
on public comment EPA anticipates that in most cases the kit manufacturer will be the certifying party. Since the certifier
will 
assume liability for in-use vehicle performance failures that result from faulty installations, EPA expects that
the certifier will develop oversight programs to insure that installations are performed properly and will enter
into indemnification agreements with installers. Kit manufacturers would be wholly within their rights to require
such indemnification agreements before allowing installers to install their kit. 

Thus, the result of holding the certifier solely responsible is consistent with the intent of the second option and
with public comment in that it provides that the responsibility for certification, and warranty and recall will be
distributed equitably among all those responsible for the completion of the final vehicle. Given that under the second
option, kit manufacturers would have been liable for any violation (although EPA would have attempted to enforce
against the party it believed was responsible), this approach does not substantially increase manufacturers' liability.
In addition, enforcement actions by EPA will be simplified and the resolution of warranty claims by 
vehicle owners will be expedited. EPA believes that this approach best satisfies the need expressed in public comment
to provide strict standards of liability in order to instill consumer confidence in the emissions performance of
converted vehicles. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and the American Gas Association encouraged EPA to establish
CFV conversion requirements that are consistent with requirements for all other conversions. Holding the converter
solely responsible is also consistent with the approach taken in the Gaseous Fuels Final Rule. 

As proposed, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) will remain 
responsible for the equipment that was on the vehicle before it was converted unless the conversion caused the failure
of the OEM equipment to function in its role in meeting emission standards. EPA believes that this is necessary because
the proper performance of the conversion configuration relies on the OEM's underlying emissions control systems.
Also, EPA interprets section 247(c) of the CAA to direct that the certifier of a CFV conversion will not be required
to warrant any vehicle for parts or operation existing in the vehicle prior to conversion and not affected by the conversion.


Public comment was mixed on the issue of OEM liability, with some 
commenters agreeing with EPA's proposed approach and others stating that the OEM should not be held responsible for
post-conversion failures of OEM equipment due to concerns over the potential impact that converted parts may have
on the performance or durability of the original parts. EPA recognizes this concern, and will evaluate in-use enforcement
actions that involve an OEM versus converter liability decision on a case by case basis. One indicator that might be
used by EPA to determine that the OEM was liable for an emission failure of a converted vehicle will be an emission-related
recall action against unconverted OEM vehicles of the same model. 

The CAA does not specify how the useful life period of converted vehicles 
should be measured for the purposes of in-use liability. EPA requested comment on this issue, and all of the public
comment received suggested that the liability of the converter should not extend beyond the original useful life
of the vehicle. Given that the emissions performance of the conversion configuration depends on the underlying emissions
control systems of the OEM, EPA agrees with this approach. Thus, the regulations promulgated by today's rule provide
that the liability of both the OEM and converter for in-use emission performance will extend to the end of the original
vehicle/engine's useful life. 

This definition of useful life creates the potential concern that fleet operations will satisfy Clean Fuel Fleet
Program (CFFP) purchase requirements through the conversion of vehicles that have little mileage remaining in their
useful life. If this occurs to a significant degree, CFFP purchase requirements could be met without achieving the
emissions reductions anticipated from the CFFP. However, EPA does not expect fleet operators to satisfy their CFFP
purchase requirements in this way because of the financial disincentives involved with converting such high mileage
vehicles and maintaining them beyond their useful life solely for the purpose of 
meeting CFFP purchase requirements.

b. 

Certification requirements. 

Dedicated, dual, or flexible fuel conversions of light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles/engines
may qualify as CFVs. CFV conversions must meet the CFV emission standards (LEV, ULEV, or ZEV) prescribed in 40 CFR Part
88 
(as described in the previous section on light-duty and heavy-duty standards) and must also meet the applicable emission
standards and provisions of Part 86 which apply to all vehicles to the extent they are not superseded by the requirements
of Part 88. In addition, the conversion must comply with the requirements of the regulations being promulgated today
to qualify as a CFV. 

A separate certification is required for each conversion configuration to be used with a given model year vehicle/engine
for each certifier desiring to perform such a conversion. The conversion configuration certification will also
be eligible for carryover to future model years only if the OEM vehicle/engine is also certified under carryover provisions
and no changes occurred in the conversion configuration. A dual-fuel or flexible fuel conversion must be certified
according to the general requirements for 
dual-fuel/flexible fuel vehicles discussed in section A.1.a above. 

It should be noted that a certificate issued for a given model year expires on December 31st of that calendar year, after
which time a conversion under that certificate may no longer be performed. A conversion for a given model year may be
introduced for sale prior to January 1st of that year, but in no case may a conversion be introduced prior to January
1st of the preceding year. 

i. 

Small-volume manufacturers certification program_volume limits. 

Consistent with the Gaseous Fuels Rule, today's rule establishes that a 
conversion configuration may be certified according to the Small-Volume 
Manufacturers Certification Program (55 FR 7178, February 28, 1990) and that 
certifiers of conversion configurations will be treated the same as small volume manufacturers for this purpose.
In the Gaseous Fuels NPRM and in the proposal for this rule, EPA proposed that all certifiers of conversion configurations
be permitted to use the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program, regardless of the annual volume of conversions.
Public comment on the gaseous fuels NPRM
 was received that suggested that the production volume limits that currently define a small volume vehicle manufacturer
under 40 CFR 86.092-14 should also apply to parties seeking to 
certify a conversion configuration. The Agency agrees with this comment and believes that given the anticipated
increase in demand for conversions in response to a variety of federal and state programs, it is reasonable to believe
that existing or future manufacturers may produce more than 10,000 converted vehicles annually at some point in the
future. (No current company produces this number of conversions). EPA does not believe it would be equitable for certifiers
with sales or production of more than 10,000 converted vehicles to take advantage of the Small Volume Manufacturer's
Certification Program when that program is not available to manufacturers of more than 10,000 new vehicles. EPA believes
it would be inappropriate to provide relief designed for small volume manufacturers to entities that sell or produce
more than 10,000 converted vehicles annually. 





Thus, consistent with the approach taken in the Gaseous Fuels Rule, EPA believes that the volume limits that currently
apply to manufacturers seeking to certify under the provisions for small volume manufacturers should also apply
to parties seeking to certify under the CFF program. Small-volume aftermarket conversion certifiers will also have
the option of using the EPA full certification program prescribed in 40 CFR 86.094-23. Aftermarket conversion
certifiers with annual sales or production volume of more than 10,000 converted vehicles should be required to use
the EPA full certification program. 

While the sales volume limit in the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program applies to sales for a particular
model year, conversion companies may certify conversion configurations based on engine families from older model
years. To accommodate this, the 10,000 vehicle limit will apply to the aggregate total of all vehicles converted within
a calendar year by a given aftermarket conversion certifier at all of its installation facilities without regard
to the model year of the original vehicles upon which the configurations are based. All vehicle conversions within
a calendar year will be considered when determining whether the 10,000 vehicle limit is exceeded 
including those converted under the CFF program, the Gaseous Fuels Rule, and 
Memorandum 1A. Apart from this difference, all provisions related to the sales volume limit under the Small-Volume
Manufacturers Certification Program would apply (40 CFR Part 86, as promulgated by 55 FR 7178, February 28, 1990).

In this rulemaking, EPA did not propose to set a sales or production volume 
limit for manufacturers wishing to certify according to the Small Volume Manufacturers 
Certification Program (the ``volume limit''), nor did EPA receive any comments in this 
rulemaking suggesting that such a volume limit should be used. In this circumstance, 
EPA believes it should not finalize a volume limit without first providing the public an 
opportunity to comment on such a limit. Therefore, the portion of today's rule that 
limits the use of the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification program to those 
certifiers with an annual sales or production volume of 10,000 or fewer converted 
vehicles, shall be effective on November 29, 1994, unless the information collection requirements contained in
this section 
have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In that 
case, EPA will publish a timely document in the 

Federal Register

 delaying the effective 
date. If, on or before October 31, 1994. EPA does not receive notification that someone wishes to file an adverse or
negative 
comment on the volume limit portion of the rule, then the volume limit portion of the 
rule will become final and effective without further EPA action. On the other hand, if, 
on or before October 31, 1994, EPA 
receives notification that someone wishes to file adverse or negative comment on the volume limit portion of the rule,
EPA will withdraw the 
volume limit portion of the rule. EPA will then repropose the volume limit and go 
through full notice-and-comment procedures before adopting the volume limit. If EPA 
were to withdraw this portion of the rule, all certifiers would be able to certify according 
to the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program until and unless EPA issued 
a final rule that established a different requirement. 
ii. 

Small-volume manufacturers certification program_durability testing. 


Under the Small-Volume Manufacturer's Certification Program, a certifier will be 
required to demonstrate durability unless the certifier is specifically authorized to use 
another certifier's durability data and deterioration factors. If deterioration factors are 
not available, certifiers will be required to use assigned deterioration factors from the 
Small-Volume Manufacturer's Certification Program. Current regulations require that 
assigned deterioration factors be determined based on the seventieth percentile of 
industry-wide gasoline-fueled vehicle deterioration factors. Since the emission 
deterioration characteristics of vehicles operating on other fuels may be different, EPA 
may in the future consider through rulemaking the use of deterioration factors based 
on data from vehicles using different fuels when developing deterioration factors for 
such vehicles. 
The Small-Volume Manufacturers Program requires manufacturers to provide 
full low mileage emission data which show compliance with new vehicle emission 
standards, but requires complete durability testing only for vehicles with unproven 
technology. Certification through use of the small-volume certification program 
reduces the burden of durability testing for small volume manufacturers while providing 
reasonable assurance of emission compliance. Public comment was received that to 
further reduce the burden on small volume manufacturers, EPA should accept as 
proven technology under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Program any aftermarket 
conversion technology that has been durability tested and certified under CARB's 
bench testing rules
 or has been durability tested using on-road mileage 
accumulation. 





As specified in 40 CFR 86.092-2, EPA will accept bench or road test data that 
has been demonstrated to be equal or more severe than certification mileage 
accumulation requirements to satisfy the requirements for proven technology under the 
Small-Volume Manufacturers Program. Thus, durability test data collected to satisfy 
CARB's bench testing rules or by on-road mileage accumulation could be submitted to 
EPA for review under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Program. EPA reserves the 
right to evaluate the adequacy of such data, and acceptance by CARB will not 
constitute automatic acceptance by EPA. It should be noted that EPA requires in-use 
data to demonstrate that bench and on-road durability testing is equal or more severe 
than certification mileage accumulation requirements. For example, actual 
temperature trace data collected during vehicle operation must be used to 
demonstrate that the temperature experienced during bench aging testing is at least 
as severe. 
It should also be noted that EPA will only permit the use of provisions in the 
Small-Volume Certification Program to demonstrate the durability of technology that is 
currently used in automotive applications. For technology that has not previously been 
used in automotive applications in certified vehicles the full mileage accumulation 
durability requirements will be required. 
iii. 

Other provisions.

 
EPA is also establishing other requirements with which certifiers must comply. 
For vehicles converted under today's regulations, the certifier must list each installer 
which produces CFV conversions on the certification application for that CFV 
conversion. A revised list must be submitted as new installers are authorized to 
produce the conversion configuration. Because the certifier will be treated as the 
manufacturer for purposes of sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement 
provisions, EPA anticipates that certifiers will enter into legally binding agreements 
with installers to ensure that installers are exercising due care in performing the 
installation and meeting other obligations under today's regulations.

In cases where installations of conversion configurations are performed by 
parties other than the certifier, EPA envisions that the certifier will enter into legally 
binding agreements with said installers. To facilitate EPA enforcement actions each 
installer must be listed on the certificate filed with EPA at the time of certification for 
each conversion configuration, and the certifier must submit a revised list to EPA 
when new installers are added. The certifier is responsible for compliance with any 
applicable production line testing requirements (e.g., Selective Enforcement Auditing in 
federal certification) regarding the availability of vehicles and emissions testing 
facilities at the certifier's facilities and at those of the certifier's installers. 
Identification of a converted CFV as a LEV, ULEV, or ZEV will be based on the 
information provided to EPA at the time of the certification of the conversion 
configuration. To aid in their identification, a converted CFV must be labeled as such 
on the engine labels. Consistent with other EPA certification programs, records are 
required to be maintained of the tests performed to support the certification 
application, and these records must be made available to EPA enforcement personnel 
upon request. Certifiers must maintain records of each vehicle converted including the 
make of the vehicle, vehicle identification number, serial number of the conversion kit, 
date and location of the conversion, and the results of the post-installation emission 
test discussed in the following section. 
c. 

Conversion installation quality test

. i. 

Background.

 
The CFV emission standards are considerably more stringent than conventional 
standards, and converted vehicles certified as CFV's will be eligible to earn marketable 
purchase and emission credits and to receive TCM exemptions as CFVs in the Clean 
Fuel Fleet program (LEVs, ULEVs, ZEVs or ILEVs). In the NPRM EPA requested 
comment on whether additional requirements are necessary to ensure compliance with 
the CFV standards given that the conversion industry historically has consisted of a 
large number of relatively small businesses that have not previously faced specific 
emissions performance requirements. Specifically, EPA requested comment on 
whether it would be useful to require a post-installation test for converted vehicles to 
assess the quality of the conversion installation from an emissions perspective. Such 
a test is required by the California Air Resources Board in its regulation of alternative 
fuel retrofit systems.





Of those commenting on this subject, all expressed concern regarding reports 
of poor emissions performance of some converted vehicles presently in use and 
stated that EPA should promulgate strict standards to instill consumer confidence in 
the emissions performance of CFVs. There was support for the EPA concept of a 
post-installation test requirement to help identify poor installations or defective 
conversion kit hardware that would otherwise result in high emissions.

ii. 

Summary of today's action. 

EPA believes that the certification program and warranty and liability provisions promulgated by today's notice
address many of the concerns noted in the public comments and will provide a fair degree of confidence that the in-use
emissions performance of CFVs will remain within the applicable standards. EPA believes that these provisions,
coupled with production line and in-use testing programs, will adequately ensure that installations by larger conversion
manufacturers that produce or sell more than 10,000 converted vehicles per year will be performed properly and that
the emissions performance of these vehicles will meet expectations. However, EPA believes that it is uncertain whether
smaller conversion manufacturers will have the resources and experience to institute the necessary quality control
measures. Therefore, to provide greater assurance that conversion hardware is installed properly, EPA will require
that each vehicle converted by a manufacturer that sells or produces less than 10,000 converted vehicles per year
undergo a post-installation test to assess the quality of the installation from an emissions perspective before
it may be sold as a CFV or is eligible for special benefits available under the CFF program.
 For vehicles that fail the post-installation test, the certifier will be required to take such remedial actions as
are necessary to ensure compliance, and to retest each vehicle before it is sold as a CFV.





Another point that supports the need for a post-installation test for small-volume conversion manufacturers is
the anticipated difficulty in conducting production line emissions testing at small manufacturers' facilities.
In such cases, small production volumes will make the necessary statistical sampling difficult to achieve, and such
manufacturers will not generally have on-site test equipment capable of running FTP testing. Due to these difficulties,
EPA will not be able to rely on production line testing of small manufacturers to the same degree as it will for larger
volume manufacturers. Requiring post-installation testing of small-volume manufacturers helps to compensate
for this limitation. 

EPA proposed to allow manufacturers that convert fewer than 300 vehicles per year special exemptions from the post-installation
test requirements when access to inspection and maintenance test facilities is not available in the area where the
production facility for converted vehicles is located.
 EPA believes that it is unlikely that manufacturers will be located in areas without access to such facilities. However,
inspection and maintenance testing is not available for heavy duty vehicles in all areas, and the alternate two-speed
idle post-installation test may represent a significant burden for small manufacturers. Therefore, in cases where
inspection and maintenance testing is not available, manufacturers which sell or produce fewer than 300 vehicles
in a calendar year may request an exemption from EPA from the post-installation test requirement. Included in the
request for exemption must be the estimated number of vehicles and engines that the manufacturer will convert in the
calendar year, a description of any emissions related quality control procedures used, and sufficient information
to demonstrate that the post-installation testing requirement represents a severe financial hardship. Within
120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption
has been granted, or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been demonstrated and that all of the manufacturer's
vehicles are subject to the post-installation testing requirement.





If granted, an exemption from the post installation testing requirement would apply only to the manufacturer's vehicles
which have the conversion installations performed outside of a nonattainment area with an inspection and maintenance
testing program that has a test for CO emissions. A small manufacturer that is exempted from the post-installation
test requirement could sell untested converted vehicles otherwise certified as CFVs. These vehicles could be used
by covered fleet owners in compliance with CFFV purchase requirements, would be eligible for temporal TCM exemptions,
would be eligible to participate in the CFF purchase credit program, and could qualify as ILEVs.

EPA considered allowing the post-installation test to be alternately conducted by the purchaser to provide additional
flexibility for those manufacturers who may not have access to inspection and maintenance test facilities. Upon
further evaluation of this option, EPA believes that it is unworkable given that it would create a situation where
the requirements for producing a certified vehicle would not be complete until after the manufacturer transferred
the title of the converted vehicle to the ultimate purchaser. To be eligible as a CFV, each vehicle emission control
information label
 must state that it is a clean fuel vehicle (indicating that a post-installation test was performed as required). The
transfer of the vehicle title before all of the criteria for certification of the converted vehicles are met would
raise doubts as to the validity of such a label given that a vehicle purchaser could fail to perform the required test.







Public comment largely supported the use of a CO emissions test such as that discussed in the NPRM for the post-installation
emission evaluation. Commenters agreed that the approach proposed by EPA would be useful in uncovering gross installation
errors and would provide an additional level of assurance that CFV emission standards will be met in-use. EPA believes
that the simple requirements of such a CO emissions test will fulfill the goal of uncovering gross installation errors
without imposing a significant burden on small-volume manufacturers.
 It should be noted that this test is intended as a screening mechanism only and may not be as discriminating of emissions
levels as tests performed for inspection and maintenance purposes or a full Federal Test Procedure. 





Two options will be available to satisfy the post-installation test requirement. Under both options, a separate
test would be required for dual-fuel vehicles for each fuel on which the converted vehicle is capable of operating.
Under the first option, a CO emissions test could be performed using the same equipment, procedure, and pass/fail
criteria as that used under the inspection and maintenance testing program in the area where the testing is conducted.
This test could be performed at an official inspection and maintenance facility, by the manufacturer, or by the manufacturer's
contractor. If pass/fail criteria specific to the converted vehicle's operation on alternative fuel are not available
the pass/fail criteria applicable to the vehicle's operation on gasoline prior to conversion will be used. In cases
where inspection and maintenance testing procedures are not available the second post-installation testing option
described below must be used. The second post-installation testing option may also be used in areas where inspection
and maintenance facilities are available at the manufacturer's discretion. 

In the NPRM EPA discussed adopting a single-speed idle test per 40 CFR 85.2212 as an alternative to the inspection and
maintenance testing facilities procedure described above. Since the publication of the NPRM, EPA has further evaluated
the capabilities and limitations of potential post-installation test procedures and has determined that measuring
CO emissions on an existing two-speed idle test
 would provide greater assurance of properly identifying gross installation errors while limiting the potential
of false failures as compared to a single-step idle test. EPA believes that the minor change from a single-speed to
a two-speed idle test will not add significantly to the cost and difficulty of post-installation testing.
 The California Air Resources Board's regulation of alternative fuel retrofit systems also requires that a two-speed
idle test be performed as part of a post-installation vehicle evaluation.
 For these reasons, EPA is adopting the two-speed idle test of CO emissions as the required post-installation test
when an inspection and maintenance test procedure is not available. 







A two-speed idle test is required to be performed on the certification vehicle during certification testing to establish
reference values (at idle and 2500 rpm) against which post-installation test results may be compared. EPA considered
requiring that each vehicle's post-installation test CO emissions measurement be below the reference value established
at the time of certification plus 20 percent of the reference value. The comment received from the public on the post-installation
test pass/fail criteria indicated that the CO emissions of some CFVs may be so low as to make the use of a cut point at this
level impractical given the measurement accuracy of the test. One commenter suggested an alternative cut point of
the CO certification reference value plus 0.4 percent CO by volume.

This cutpoint is very similar to the 0.5 percent CO standard promulgated for the certification short test (CST) two-speed
idle procedure for gasoline-fueled vehicles (58 FR 58382-58440, November 1, 1993). The choice of the CST standard
was based on a review of data collected from inspection and maintenance facilities that employ a two-speed idle test
which indicate that production line gasoline powered vehicles from non-pattern failure engine families could easily
meet a 0.5 percent CO standard.
 Since the CO emissions of CFVs can be expected to be no greater than, and in many cases are expected to be less than, those
from vehicles meeting Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards, EPA believes that properly manufactured CFVs can also easily meet
a 0.5 percent CO standard and will therefore not have difficulty in meeting a standard of 0.4 percent plus the certification
reference value (the sum of which will likely total more than 0.5 percent in most instances). Based on the above discussion,
EPA agrees that a cut point of the CO certification reference value plus 0.4 percent CO by volume provides reasonable
assurance that gross installation errors will be discovered while sufficiently limiting the probability of false
test failures, and therefore will adopt this pass/fail criteria for the two-speed idle post-installation test.






C. The California Pilot Test Program 



The Pilot program will be federally administered in the State of California and will require vehicle manufacturers
to sell a minimum number of clean-fuel LDVs and LDTs in California starting in MY 1996. Unlike the CFF program, the Pilot
program's requirements do not include HDVs. The CAA gives EPA several responsibilities with regard to the Pilot program.
EPA has already implemented a credit program for vehicle manufacturers (57 FR 60038, December 17, 1992; 40 CFR 88.304-94)
and today's action covers vehicle sales requirements and state opt-in provisions. The light-duty vehicle and truck
CFV emission standards applicable to vehicles under both the Pilot and CFF program are discussed above under section
A.1.a. 



1. Sales Requirements 



a. 

CAA Requirements.

 Section 249(c) of the CAA requires EPA to promulgate regulations requiring that ``[c]lean fuel vehicles shall be
produced, sold, and distributed (in accordance with normal business practices and applicable franchise agreements)
to ultimate purchasers in California (including owners of covered fleets . . .) in numbers that meet
or exceed'' 150,000 in MYs 1996 through 1998 and 300,000 in MYs 1999 and later. However, the CAA does not direct EPA on
how to distribute these sales requirements among vehicle manufacturers. Section 249(d) allows EPA to make available
credits for use in the ``fulfillment of [a] manufacturer's share of the requirements'' of the Pilot program. As mentioned
earlier, EPA has established a credit program that allows manufacturers to use credits to meet the sales requirements
of the Pilot program. 

b. 

CARB requirements

. CARB's Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program will require the sale of vehicles meeting more stringent exhaust emission
levels by establishment of (1) a decreasing fleet average NMOG emission requirement (for manufacturers of vehicles
up to 6,000 lbs GVWR) and (2) through direct sales percentage requirements (for manufacturers of vehicles from 6,000
to 14,000 lbs GVWR). (Note: The Pilot program and the California LEV program will overlap only for those vehicles up
to 8,500 lbs GVWR, as the Pilot program does not cover vehicles beyond this GVWR.) 

The CARB program will require each manufacturer of vehicles up to 6,000 lbs GVWR to sell LEVs in each of two LVW subclasses
(>3750 and 3750-5750 lbs LVW) . Each manufacturer will need to sell a sufficient number of LEVs such that the
manufacturer's California fleet average NMOG exhaust emission value is less than or equal to a fleet average NMOG
exhaust emission requirement for the corresponding model year, vehicle type, and LVW subclass. In addition to meeting
the fleet average NMOG requirement, each manufacturer must also sell a required minimum percentage of ZEVs starting
in the 1998 MY. Also beginning with MY 1998, CARB requires that manufacturers of medium-duty vehicles (i.e., trucks
from 6,001 to 14,000 lbs GVWR) certify enough such vehicles to CARB's emission standards such that the manufacturer's
fleet consists of a minimum percentage of ULEVs. 

The projected sales of vehicles in California resulting from the CARB LEV program are likely to far exceed the sales
of CFVs under the Pilot program. Based on the projected sales of only LDVs and LDTs under 3,750 LVW in 1996 and 1999, sales
under the CARB LEV program are expected to reach about 200 and 400 percent of the Pilot program CFV sales requirements,
respectively. Unless and until EPA adopts California standards for CFVs, CARB LEVs which do not meet federal CFV requirements
could not be counted in the Pilot program (although vehicles meeting CFV requirements will likely meet the exhaust
emission requirements of the CARB LEV program). 

c. 

California Pilot Program sales requirements

_i. 

``Sales'' definition.

 CAA Section 249(c)(1) requires that ``[c]lean fuel vehicles be produced, sold, and distributed to ultimate purchasers
in California''. EPA is today establishing this requirement as applying at the first point of sale from the manufacturer
to the dealer or ultimate owner. Until such time as EPA formally changes its interpretation of section 249(c), manufacturers
covered by the Pilot program may not use sales of converted vehicles to meet the sales requirements of the Pilot program.
Similarly, manufacturers of conversions are not subject to the sales requirements. As was stated in the NPRM for this
rule, nothing in section 249(c)(1) requires that conversions be part of the CFV sales requirements. Furthermore,
section 247 sets forth requirements applicable to conversions and states that conversions to CFVs that meet those
requirements may be used to satisfy the purchase requirements of the federal CFF program; however, there is no mention
of the Pilot program.

In light of the evolving regulatory framework affecting conversions, culminating with today's provisions for CFV
conversions, EPA is reconsidering whether it is appropriate for manufacturers of CFV conversions to participate
in the Pilot program. This reconsideration is largely due to the fact that manufacturers of CFV conversions under
today's rule will be treated like vehicle manufacturers for purposes of compliance with EPA emission regulations.
EPA may propose by regulation in the future to include manufacturers of conversions in the Pilot program. EPA will
solicit public comment on this issue at that time. 



ii. Manufacturer sales distribution. 

Although CAA section 249 clearly indicates that vehicle manufacturers are responsible for meeting sales requirements,
it does not cover how the sales requirements are to be allocated among manufacturers. Sales under the California LEV
Program are likely to far exceed the sales requirements set forth in the Pilot program and, since the vehicles for the
two programs will be identical or at least very similar, the Pilot program requirements will likely be easily satisfied.
As a result, any method for allocating sales requirements among manufacturers will have little impact. 

Two options for determining a manufacturer's individual sales allocation were presented in the NPRM. In both options,
an equation was used to calculate a manufacturer's share of required CFV sales based on the share of that manufacturer's
vehicle sales in the State of California during the previous model year. Under Option 1, EPA would be responsible for
calculating the individual sales responsibilities; in the second option, manufacturers would perform the computation.
The primary concern of those commenters who responded was that only California vehicle sales be considered since
the Pilot program was to be implemented in California. The proposed regulations were written based on the second option
and it is this option that is finalized today. 

A manufacturer's share of the total CFV sales requirement in any given year (150,000 CFVs annually for 1996-1997;
300,000 CFVs annually thereafter) will be based on the ratio of the manufacturer's sales to all sales in California
according to the following equation:

 


RMS = (MS/TS)  x  TCPPS 




where: 




RMS = a manufacturer's required sales in a given model year. 

MS = a manufacturer's total LDV and light LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for
MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). 



= a manufacturer's total LDV and light LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for MY
1998 and later RMS calculations). 



TS = total LDV and light LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question
(for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will
not be included. 



= total LDV and light LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question
(for MY 1998 and later RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will
not be included. 



TCPPS = Pilot program CFV sales requirement for the year in question (either 150,000 or 300,000). 




Each manufacturer will use this equation to determine its individual CFV sales requirement. The two factors, MS and
TS, will be based on vehicle sales two MYs from the year in question (e.g, for MY 1996, a manufacturer will use sales data
from MY 1994). In the NPRM, EPA requested comment as to whether a manufacturer's share of required CFV sales should
be calculated based on sales in the previous model year or sales two model years prior. Commenters did not address this
issue. EPA believes that using MY sales data that is two years prior, as opposed to only one year, is not likely to reflect
the most recent market changes and will also allow new manufacturers a two year delay before they are factored into
the equation; however, it will provide manufacturers with sufficient time for planning their CFV production and
will also require less administration and oversight on the part of both EPA and manufacturers. EPA believes that the
CFV sales distribution that will result among manufacturers will be fair and equitable in light of these advantages.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the requirement that California sales figures from two model years earlier be used by
manufacturers to calculate required CFV sales shares. 



Since heavy LDT standards under the Pilot program are not effective until MY 1998, a manufacturer's share of required
sales for MYs 1996 and 1997 will be based on LDV and light LDT sales only. All LDV and LDT sales will be used once the CFV
standards for heavy LDTs are in effect beginning with MY 1998.

iii. 

Exemptions for small volume manufacturers. 

EPA proposed that, for the Pilot program, small volume manufacturers of clean-fuel LDVs and LDTs would not have to
fulfill a calculated share of the required CFV sales requirements until the 2001 MY. EPA is finalizing this requirement
today. However, in 2001 and subsequent model years, no further distinction will be made between small volume manufacturers
and larger manufacturers for purposes of the Pilot program.
As defined in the CARB LEV program, a small volume manufacturer has average annual vehicle sales less than or equal
to 3,000 vehicles based on the consecutive three-year period 1989-1991. If a small volume manufacturer exceeds
this average level, they are then subject to the LEV program fleet average NMOG requirements applicable to larger
manufacturers beginning four model years after the last of the consecutive three model years. Larger manufacturers
with average sales that fall below the 3,000 unit threshold over any consecutive three-year period qualify as small
volume manufacturers beginning with the following model year.
Due to the many parallels between the Pilot program and the CARB LEV program, EPA continues to believe it is logical
that the ``small volume manufacturer'' definition under the Pilot program should be as similar as possible to the
definition under the CARB LEV program. Several commenters also supported consistency between the two programs.
Therefore, for purposes of the Pilot program, EPA is defining ``small volume manufacturer'' as one whose average
annual LDV and LDT sales in California are less than or equal to 3,000 units during a consecutive three-year period
beginning no earlier than 1993. (This accommodates new manufacturers who may have less than three consecutive years
of sales but which do not exceed the 3,000 threshold.) And, like CARB, EPA is also granting leadtime to small volume
manufacturers who exceed the average annual level. A manufacturer who qualifies as a small volume manufacturer for
the first year of the Pilot program (i.e., in model year 1996) will not have to fulfill a CFV sales requirement until
model year 2001. As proposed in the NPRM and finalized here today, beginning with model year 2001, all manufacturers,
regardless of average annual sales, will have to calculate and fulfill their CFV sales share based on the formula above.
This five-year delay is intended to encourage the viability of small volume manufacturers whose limited capital
and resources do not allow them to comply as easily. It is also intended to provide consistency with the CARB LEV program
and minimize adminstrative burden.
iv. 

Sales reporting and enforcement of requirements. 

In order for EPA to administer and enforce the sales requirements of the Pilot Program, manufacturers will have to
report their California vehicles sales to EPA. Currently, there is a requirement for manufacturers to submit sales
data to EPA in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 40 CFR 86.085-37); however, the reporting requirements do
not distinguish between California vehicle sales and sales throughout the U.S. Such a distinction is necessary for
purposes of the Pilot Program. Therefore, EPA will require that manufacturers, in addition to complying with the
requirements of 40 CFR 86.085-37, report the number of vehicles sold only in California.
If a manufacturer fails to meet its required sales volume, EPA believes that it has the authority to penalize the manufacturer
to the full extent allowed for such an infraction under CAA section 205(a). In accordance with this section, a $25,000
penalty will be levied on a manufacturer in the event of a failure to meet the prescribed sales requirements for certified
Pilot Program vehicles.


2. State Opt-In Program


CAA section 249(f) requires that EPA promulgate regulations which will (1) allow states other than California to
encourage the sale of CFVs in their state which are sold in California under the Pilot program and (2) allow such states
to use incentives to promote the sale and use of CFVs and clean alternative fuels. States opting into the program may
voluntarily decide to implement a clean fuel vehicle incentive program as described in this Final Rule.
Any state that contains all or part of any ozone nonattainment area that is classified under subpart D of Title I as serious,
severe, or extreme can choose to submit a revision of their applicable state implementation plan (SIP) under part
D of Title I and section 110. A state's SIP shall include incentives for the sale and use of CFVs and for the production
and distribution of clean alternative fuels such as those that are required to be produced, sold, and distributed
in the State of California. These SIP provisions shall come into effect at least one year after the state has notified
vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers of the plan provisions.
As mentioned above, section 249(f) directs EPA to establish the voluntary opt-in program under which states may use
incentives to promote the sale and use of CFVs and clean alternative fuels. Examples of incentives listed in section
249(f) include higher registration fees for non-CFVs, financial incentives, exemptions from high occupancy vehicle
or trip reduction requirements, and parking preferences. Today's rule establishes these incentives for use by states
under a section 249(f) opt-in provision. States may develop additional incentives, as well, subject to EPA approval
via the SIP approval process.
Section 249(f) prohibits a state opting into the program from including sales or production mandates for CFVs or clean
alternative fuels in its SIP revision opting into the Pilot program. In addition, the SIP revision must provide that
vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers will not be penalized or subject to sanctions for failing to produce or sell
CFVs or clean alternative fuels.

1. Explanatory Language in the Preamble of the Final Rulemaking for Clean Fuel Fleet Definitions and General Provisions
Is Clarified in Four Areas, as Described Below 


a. 

The role of fleet payment methods in establishing whether fleet vehicles are centrally fueled. 

In the description of ``contract fueling'' as it pertains to the definition of ``centrally fueled'' (section III(3)(a)
of the Definitions final rule preamble, 58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993), EPA indicated that the nature of the method
of payment used by a fleet operator for fuel purchases might be useful for determining whether the fueling arrangement
constituted ``central fueling.'' In its description, EPA stated that ``retail credit cards'' would not represent
central fueling arrangements while ``commercial fleet credit cards'' would represent such arrangements.
Since the time of the final rule, parties representing fleet leasing companies and independent fuel marketers informed
the Agency that the emerging business in broad national fleet fueling cards requires further clarification of this
issue. These parties have indicated that the use of such cards, which generally include a wide network of fuel providers
nationwide and an administrative system for monitoring fuel purchases, do not necessarily indicate that fueling
is occurring at a central facility or set of facilities. Similarly, the use of retail credit cards does not prove that
fueling is not occurring in a centralized way. EPA believes there is value in these observations, and the Agency will
no longer recommend that states look to the payment method as a key indicator of the presence or absence of central fueling.
Instead, EPA recommends that states look at the actual refueling patterns used by fleet operators. When an individual
fleet's fueling is limited to a single location or a prescribed and identified set of locations within the operational
range of the vehicles, EPA believes this situation represents central fueling, regardless of the method of payment
for the fuel. As the implementation of state fleet programs evolves, EPA may consider further clarification of this
issue, by rule or by guidance.
b. 

Clarification of the determination of whether a fleet is ``capable of being centrally fueled''.

 In the preamble of the Definitions final rulemaking, EPA described a preferred technique for determining fleets
capability of being centrally fueled, based on the number of miles from trips that could be centrally fueled. Because
of an editorial oversight, portions of section III(4)(a)(i) and (4)(c) of the Definitions final rule preamble may
be misleading (58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993). EPA wishes to clarify that the number of miles from trips that could be
centrally fueled should be tabulated only from those trips that do not require the fleet vehicle to travel outside
of its operational range (i.e., the distance a vehicle is able to travel on a round trip with a single refueling). This
clarification makes the method of calculation consistent with the stated intent of the overall determination procedure.
c. 

Correction to reference in the definition of ``owned or operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by such person''.


The definition of ``owned or operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by such person'' in  88.302-94
of the Definitions final rule regulations may be misleading (58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993). Paragraph (2) within
this definition refers to the definition of ``control'' as being in paragraph (c) of  88.302-94; however,
the definition of ``control'' is not designated as paragraph (c). Thus, EPA wishes to clarify that in the definition
of ``owned or operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by such person'' it intended to refer to the definition of
``control'' in  88.302-94.
d. 

Correction to the instructions for the promulgation of  88.308-94 of the regulations, entitled ``Programmatic
requirements for clean-fuel fleet vehicles''. 

Because of an editorial error, the definition of ``multi-state nonattainment areas'' ( 88.308-94)
in the Definitions final rule regulation (58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993) was described as an amendment to a previously
promulgated section instead of a new definition to be promulgated in a new section of part 88. Thus, EPA wishes to clarify
that it intended to add a new  88.308-94 to 40 CFR part 88.

2. Harmonization of ILEV Exhaust Standards and Test Procedures With the CFV Provisions


In EPA's final rule on ``Clean Fuel Fleet Credit Programs, Transportation Control Measure Exemptions, and Related
Provisions'' (58 FR 11888, March 1, 1993), Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle (ILEV) emission standards and test procedures
were established. The exhaust emission standards were published in tables C93-6, C93-6.1, and C93-6.2.
With the finalizing of exhaust emission standards and test procedures in today's rule, the earlier treatment of ILEV
standards and test procedures for exhaust emissions are now obsolete. Technical revisions of the ILEV regulations
are included in today's rule. These changes have the effect of focusing ILEV exhaust requirements on those of other
CFVs, while the special ILEV evaporative emissions standard and test procedure remains unchanged.


E. Display of OMB Control Numbers


EPA is also amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for various regulations. This amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements
contained in this final rule which have already been approved. This display of the OMB control number and the subsequent
codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320.
The ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be necessary. For the same reasons, EPA finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).


F. Regulatory Impacts


The economic and environmental impacts of this rulemaking are only from the provisions pertaining to the Clean Fuel
Fleet Program since the impacts of the California Pilot Program will most likely be superseded by the projected effect
of the CARB LEV program and other federal requirements and should not create additional economic or environmental
impact. EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) that evaluates the program costs, potential program
benefits, and cost effectiveness of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program. As described in the proposal, included here is a
summary of the results of those analyses. The program costs and potential benefits related to light-duty vehicles
and trucks are evaluated separately from those of heavy-duty vehicles (above 8,500 lbs GVWR) because the CFV standards
and the technology used to meet them are very different for the light-duty and heavy-duty classes.


1. Program Costs


a. 

Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. 

As described in the proposal, to estimate the potential costs of clean-fuel LDVs and LDTs, EPA has developed two scenarios
representing different assumptions about the future use of nonconventional fuels. Scenario I assumes no major changes
from conditions that exist today. Scenario II assumes the emergence of some driving force that would encourage or
require OEMs to offer more non-petroleum fuel/vehicle combinations.
Using the above scenarios, the incremental acquisition and operating costs, coupled with estimates of the number
of CFVs operating, can be used to estimate an overall cost of the fleet program for LDVs and LDTs. The incremental acquisition
cost is the amount a fleet owner must pay for a CFV above the cost of a comparable conventional vehicle, and different
incremental costs are associated with each vehicle/fuel type. As in the proposal, EPA estimates an incremental acquisition
cost of $170 for vehicles fueled with reformulated gasoline, $300 for alcohol-fueled vehicles, $2,000 for gaseous-fueled
vehicles, and $3,300 for electric vehicles.
Another fleet program cost is incurred in the operation of clean-fuel vehicles. Estimated operating costs, for all
of the vehicle/fuel combinations, are based solely on fuel costs, since no additional maintenance is expected for
CFVs above their conventional counterparts. As in the proposal, compared to conventional gasoline equivalent cost
of $1.31 in the year 2000, the projected gasoline equivalents for the same year are as follows: $1.36 for reformulated
gasoline, $1.12 for alcohol fuels, $1.09 for CNG, $0.62 for LPG, and $1.12 for electricity. Thus, all fuels except
for reformulated gasoline represent a cost savings when compared to the estimated price of conventional gasoline
in the year 2000.

<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00173 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00028 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The incremental costs for new CFV acquisitions and their operation were summed for each future year between 1998 and
2010 to yield an estimated total annual cost of the fleet program for LDVs and LDTs. The present value costs under Scenario
I for the years 1998 through 2010 is almost $709 million in 1998 dollars. Under Scenario II, the present value of the
potential costs in years 1998 through 2010 is estimated at $673 million in 1998 dollars. (In contrast to the proposal,
the discount rate used in this analysis is 7 percent instead of 10 percent as recommended by EPA's Office of Policy,
Planning, and Evaluation.)
 Projected annual costs for each of the years from 1998 to 2010 are presented in the RIA. This analysis does not take into
account infrastructure costs. EPA has examined the sensitivity of the projected incremental acquisition and operating
costs results in the RIA to other reasonable estimates of future acquisition and operating costs and concluded that
the impact on the cost effectiveness is not major.




b. 

Heavy-duty vhicles. 

As described in the draft RIA for the proposal, incremental acquisition costs were estimated for conventional gasoline
and diesel HDVs expected to be capable of meeting CFV standards through the use of technological changes rather than
the use of clean fuels themselves. However, possible manufacturing process changes or slightly higher component
costs may be incurred when adapting these technologies to HDEs. The analysis projects that these changes could increase
the variable production cost of heavy-duty gasoline engines by $50.00 and heavy-duty diesel engines by about $100.00.
Factoring in a 29 percent overhead and profit mark-up would bring the estimated increase in manufacturing costs to
$65 and $129 per engine for gasoline and diesel engines respectively. In addition to this increased manufacturing/component
cost per engine, consumers will also have to pay for the amortized cost of research and development and engine certification,
as well as retail price mark-up. Manufacturers are expected to recover the development costs over the first five years
of engine sales. Thus, using a more conservative range of projected costs than in the proposal, the total incremental
acquisition cost is estimated at $246 more per gasoline engine and $477 more per diesel engine for the first five years
of the program as compared with engines used in conventional heavy-duty vehicles. During the remaining years of the
program, the total incremental acquisition cost is estimated at $178 more per gasoline engine and $338 more per diesel
engine.
Gasoline- and diesel-fuel HDVs meeting CFV standards are not expected to have added fuel or maintenance costs compared
to conventional HDVs. However, EPA expects that approximately 10 percent of all fleet HDVs will need to be operated
on reformulated gasoline in an area where reformulated gasoline is not routinely supplied. Thus, as in the proposal,
an incremental fuel cost of five cents per gallon is applied to approximately 10 percent of all fleet HDVs.
The incremental costs for new CFV acquisitions and operations were summed for each year from 1998 to 2010 to yield an
estimated total annual cost of the fleet program for HDVs. As described in the proposal, three scenarios were developed
based on differing assumptions about vehicle mix and about costs of alternative-fuel vehicles compared to conventional
HDVs. The first scenario, Scenario A, assumes conventional-fuel vehicles will be purchased for the fleet program,
while the second, Scenario B, assumes 20 percent of CFVs will be nonconventional-fuel vehicles. The third scenario,
Scenario C, assumes 30 percent of CFVs are nonconventional-fuel vehicles. Thus, for the first twelve years of the
program 1998 present value cost is estimated to be $67 million for Scenario A, $99 million for Scenario B, and $30 million
for Scenario C (using a discount rate of 7 percent).





2. Program Benefits


As with the draft RIA for the proposal, the final RIA presents an analysis of the expected emission benefits of the Clean
Fuel Fleet Program. These benefits were estimated by comparing the total emissions from covered fleet vehicles to
the emissions which the same number of conventional vehicles would produce in the absence of a fleet program. As in
the economic analysis, the emission benefits of LDVs and LDTs were studied separately from HDVs, and the results of
both are summarized below. The same scenarios used in the economic analysis (i.e., assuming different degrees of
participation by non-petroleum fueled vehicles) were used in the benefits analysis. Along with vapor emission reductions,
reductions in NMOG, NO

X

, and CO combustion emissions from LDVs and LDTs, and reductions in NMHC, NO

X

, and CO combustion emissions from HDVs, are discussed below.

a. 

Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.

 To estimate the environmental benefits of the fleet program, emission inventories were generated for two cases.
In the base case, the number of covered fleet LDVs and LDTs estimated to be operating in each year were all assumed to
be conventional vehicles. The base case emission inventories were calculated by computing lifetime emission factors
for conventional (Tier 1) vehicles using the MOBILE5a emission factor model (instead of the specialized analysis
using vehicle standards developed for the proposal). Similarly, emission inventories for the covered fleet vehicles
were calculated using lifetime emission factors for LEVs from MOBILE5a. The difference between the two inventories
yields the emission benifit of the program in terms of NMOG and NO

X

 reductions. The final analyis results in 1998 present value benefits of the light-duty NMOG and NO

X

 reductions realized for the years 1998 through 2010 (using a discount rate of 7 percent) are approximately 11,720
tons and 12,119 tons, respectively.
As in the proposal, since LEVs will not generally achieve CO emission reductions, potential CO inventories were determined
using the number of light-duty ULEVs and ZEVs. The 1998 present value benefit of the annual CO reductions is projected
to range between 93,694 tons and 120,885 tons.
In addition to combustion emission benefits, the fleet program will also realize benefits from vapor emission reductions
resulting from use of CNG, LPG, and electric vehicles. Some of these benefits will be achieved by inherently low-emission
vehicles (ILEVS); however, a calculation of the amount of vapor reduction attributable to ILEVs was not attempted
because the purchase of these vehicles is voluntary and their numbers are very uncertain.
As in the proposal, vapor emission benefits of the fleet program were determined by multiplying the number of in-use
CFVs projected to be operating on CNG, LPG, and electricity, by the average annual vehicle miles traveled for each
class, and by the projected vapor emission reduction (grams/mile/vehicle) expected for each vehicle class. These
vapor emission reductions were based on MOBILE5a evaporative emission factors in today's rule instead of MOBILE5.0
evaporative emission factors as were used in the proposal. Even though the new analysis results in lower annual emission
reductions, the vapor emission benefits reported in today's rule are higher level than those in the proposal due to
the use of the 7 percent discount rate. The 1998 present value benefits of the light-duty vapor emission reduction
realized from the 1998 through 2000 are approximately 4,654 tons under Scenario I and 6,982 tons under Scenario II.
Thus, summing the benefits, the 1998 present value benefits of NMOG and CO emission reduction achieved by the light-duty
portion of the fleet program for the years 1998 through 2010 are projected to range from 16,400 to 18,700 tons and 93,700
to 121,000 tons respectively. The NO

X

 emission reduction is estimated to be approximately 12,100 tons. 
b. 

Heavy-duty vehicles.

 As in the proposal and similar to the analysis conducted for light-duty fleet vehicles, the emission benefits of heavy-duty
clean-fuel fleet vehicles have been estimated by comparing total emissions from a base case to the emissions from
a scenario using clean-fuel fleet vehicles. (Unlike LDVs and LDTs, EPA has not incorporated clean-fuel HDVs into
MOBILE5a, and thus, HDVs were modelled in the same way as in the proposal.) The clean-fuel fleet vehicle scenario assumes
that all covered fleet HDVs operate at the LEV emission level, and is used to generate emission inventories of NMHC
and NO

X

. CO benefits expected to be realized at the ULEV level are also summarized below (heavy-duty ZEVs are not likely to
be a viable option to fleet owners at the time the fleet program begins and thus no CO benefits are expected from vehicles
other than heavy-duty ULEVs).
Annual emission inventories of NMHC and NO

X

 were generated by multiplying the number of in-use heavy-duty vehicles by the number of vehicle miles traveled and
multiplying the result by the appropriate difference in emission factors. The 1998 present value benefits of the
heavy-duty NMHC and NO

X

 emission reduction realized from the 1998 through 2010 are approximately 4,100 tons and 16,400 tons, respectively.
The emission benefits are lower than the benefits reported in the proposal because the combined NMHC+NO

X

 standard was changed from the proposed 3.5 g/Bhp-hr to 3.8 g/Bhp-hr in today's final rule (See section (II)(A)(2)
above).
In determining CO benefits, there is no reduction in the CO emission standard for heavy-duty vehicles meeting the
minimum clean-fuel fleet vehicle (LEV) requirements, but gasoline ULEVs will achieve a benefit. Those vehicles
operating at the ULEV level, will include a 50 percent reduction in CO emissions from their conventional or LEV counterparts.
Diesel heavy-duty vehicles are not expected to generate incremental CO benefits since they currently emit below
the heavy-duty ULEV standard for CO. The present value of the CO emission benefits are projected to range from 15,500
to 27,000 tons/year. Using a discount rate of 7 percent in today's rule instead of the proposed 10 percent rate, results
in higher CO emission benefits than were projected in the proposal.
Vapor emission benefits were projected for the replacement of gasoline-fueled HDVs by gaseous-fueled HDVs. For
the years 1998 through 2010 the program yields 1998 present value vapor emission benefits of 2,700 to 4,500 tons. As
with LDVs and LDTs, these vapor emission reductions were based on MOBILE5a evaporative emission factors in today's
rule instead of MOBILE5.0 evaporative emission factors as were used in the proposal, and thus, the vapor emission
reductions used in today's rule for HDVs are at a higher level than those emission reductions used in the proposal.
(Also, using a discount rate of 7 percent instead of the proposed 10 percent rate contrubuted to the higher levels of
vapor emission reductions.)
Thus, summing the benefits together, the 1998 present values of NMHC and CO emission reduction achieved by the heavy-duty
portion of the fleet program for the years 1998 through 2010 are projected to range from 4,100 to 8,600 tons and to 15,500
to 27,000 tons respectively. The NO

X

 emission reduction is estimated to be approximately 16,400 tons.


3. Cost Effectiveness


As described in the proposal, for both light-duty and heavy-duty portions of the fleet program, the overall cost effectiveness
was determined by dividing the total 1998 present value costs of the first 12 years of the program by the associated
discounted 12-year benefits. The overall cost effectiveness for LDVs is estimated to range between $4,400 and $5,800
per ton of all pollutants. The analysis suggests that the fleet program will provide a greater reduction in emissions
per dollar spent if more light-duty vehicles operate on alternative fuels. The overall estimated heavy-duty cost
effectiveness ranges from $580 per ton to $3,300 per ton.

The increased use of clean alternative fuels due to the fleet program may well result in the displacement of some of
the use of conventional fuels. As in the proposal, EPA projects for the first twelve years of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program
3.2 to 6.4 billion gallons of petroleum-based fuel could be conserved. In addition to the conservation of petroleum
resources, the fleet program may provide a number of non-quantifiable impacts, as well. The program will potentially
furnish incentives for the development of clean-fuel vehicle technology, stimulate the vehicle conversion industry,
support the wider distribution of alternative fuels and related infrastructure, and encourage the public to purchase
and use clean-fuel vehicles.



III. Public Participation



As in past rulemaking actions, EPA strongly encouraged full public participation in arriving at final decisions.
On July 15, 1993 a public hearing was held for any person to present testimony in response to the proposal, and written
comments on this proposal were accepted for a period of sixty days after the hearing (September 15, 1993). EPA has fully
considered all of the comments and has modified the proposal to reflect many of the suggestions received. EPA's complete
assessment of the comments received can be found in the summary and analysis of comments document for this rulemaking,
which has been placed in Docket No. A-92-30 and A-92-69.



IV. Statutory Authority



The statutory authority for this proposal is provided by sections 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247(a), 247(b), 249,
and 301(a) of the CAA.



V. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis



Under Executive Order 12866 [58 

Federal Register

 51,735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

This rulemaking, covering emission standards for clean-fuel vehicles and engines, CFV conversion requirements,
and the California Pilot Program, is considered an ``economically significant regulatory action'' under this definition,
since the Clean Fuel Fleet Program and California Pilot Program together will cost more than $100 million annually
in at least some years of its implementation. In addition, this rule is significant in that it represents the first
motor vehicle emission control program which focus exclusively on fleets, raising a range of unprecedented issues.
Finally, the rule is significant in that it parallels in many ways the alternative fuel fleet program required in the
Energy Policy Act, which the Department of Energy is implementing; the areas of overlap between the two programs add
to the significance of the rule. For these reasons, an RIA has been prepared, and is available in the docket for this
rulemaking.

This final rulemaking was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive
Order 12866. Any written comments from OMB and any EPA response to OMB comments are in the public docket for this rulemaking.



VI. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of federal regulations
and to identify significant adverse impacts on a substantial number of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide
concrete definitions of ``small entity'', ``significant impact'', or ``substantial number'', EPA has established
guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses.
 Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires EPA to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis when the
Agency determines that there is a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. 





Concerns regarding the potential impact of this regulation on small businesses are related to vehicle conversions.
There could be a significant impact on small converters if they were distant from inspection and maintenance testing
facilities. Difficulty in using such test facilities to comply with the post-installation emission test requirement
could represent a significant economic burden to small manufacturers if they were compelled to rely solely on the
alternative two-step idle post-installation test. (See section II.B.2.c. for a discussion of the post-installation
testing requirements). However, EPA has no information to indicate that converters which may face such a situation
currently exist or will exist in the future. Generally, EPA expects that such a situation would not occur or would occur
very infrequently since there are significant economic and logistical advantages associated with locating a vehicle
conversion facility within or close to an urban area. In any event, the rule provides for converters of 300 or fewer
vehicles per year to request an exemption from the post-installation test if a severe economic hardship can be demonstrated.


EPA has evaluated the effects of this regulation and the Administrator of EPA certifies that there will not be an adverse
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was not conducted.




VII. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this rule pertaining to the California Pilot Program and the post-installation
test for converted vehicles have been submitted to OMB for approval under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act, 

44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 An Information Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1694) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer,
Information Policy Branch, EPA/OPPE/ORME, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460 (Mail Code 2136) or by calling (202)
260-2740. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect
is published in the 

Federal Register

. 

This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 1.4 hours per response and an estimated
annual recordkeeping burden averaging 67 hours per respondent. However, the hours spent annually on information
collection activities by a given manufacturer depends upon manufacturer-specific variables, such as the number
of engine families, production changes, emissions defects, and so on. This estimate includes time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA/OPPE/ORME; 401 M Street SW, (Mail Code 2136); Washington,
DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC
20503, marked ``Attention: EPA Desk Officer''. 

All other information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned control number 2060-0104. 



VIII. Consultation With DOE and DOT 



As per section 250(d) of the Clean Air Act, this rulemaking has coordinated with the Department of Energy and the Department
of Transportation. Also, pursuant to section 247(e) of the Act that states ``* * * The Secretary of
Transportation shall, if necessary, promulgate rules under applicable motor vehicle laws regarding the safety
of vehicles converted from existing and new vehicles to clean-fuel vehicles,'' this rulemaking has been coordinated
with the Department of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicles converted to CFVs. Interagency review documents
are contained in section II-F and IV-H of this rulemaking's docket. 



IX. Judicial Review 



Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby finds that these regulations are of national applicability.
Accordingly, judicial review of this action is available only by filing a petition for review of the United States
Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of publication. Under section 307(b)(2) of the
Act, the requirements which are the subject of today's notice may not be challenged later in the judicial proceedings
brought by EPA to enforce these requirements.

 88.204-94 

Sales requirements for the California Pilot Test Program.


(a) The total annual required minimum sales volume of new clean fuel vehicles in California for this program shall
correspond to Table B204.
(b) (1) When manufacturers of vehicles subject to the regulations of this section file a report pursuant to 40 CFR 86.085-37(b),
such report shall include the following information: the number of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks sold
only in California, and the number of clean-fuel vehicles sold for the Pilot program beginning with model year 1996.
(2) For model years 1996 and 1997, manufacturers may exclude heavy light-duty trucks from the reporting required
by this section.
(c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each vehicle manufacturer must sell clean-fuel vehicles
in California in an amount equal to the required annual sales volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) The required annual clean fuel vehicle sales volume for a given manufacturer is expressed in the following equation
rounded to the nearest whole number. 








Where:



RMS=a manufacturer's required sales in a given model year.
MS=a manufacturer's total LDV and light LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for
MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations).


=a manufacturer's total LDV and LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for MY 1998 and
later RMS calculations).


TS=total LDV and light LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question
(for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will
not be included.


=total LDV and LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question (for MY
1998 and later RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will not
be included.


TCPPS=Pilot program annual CFV sales requirement (either 150,000 or 300,000) for the model year in question.



(i) A manufacturer's share of required annual sales for model years 1996 and 1997 will be based on LDV and light LDT sales
only. Once the heavy LDT standards are effective beginning with model year 1998, a manufacturer's required sales
share will be based on all LDV and LDT sales.

(ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in 
California shall calculate annual required sales share based on 
projected California sales for the model year in question. In 
the second year, the manufacturer shall use actual sales from the 
previous year. In the third year and subsequent years, the 
manufacturer will use sales from two model years prior to the 
year in question. 
(d) (1) Small volume manufacturer is defined in the Pilot 
program as one whose average annual LDV and LDT sales in 
California are less than or equal to 3,000 units during a 
consecutive three-year period beginning no earlier than model 
year 1993. 
(i) A manufacturer with less than three consecutive years of 
sales in California shall use a single year of sales or, if 
available, the average of two years of sales in California to 
determine whether they fall at or below the threshold of 3,000 
units. 
(ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in 
California shall be considered a small volume manufacturer if 
their projected California sales level is at or below 3,000 units for a given year. Once the manufacturer has actual
sales data 
for one year, this actual sales data shall be used to determine 
whether the manufacturer qualifies as a small volume 
manufacturer. 
(iii) A manufacturer which does not qualify as a small volume 
manufacturer in model year 1996 but whose average annual LDV and 
LDT sales fall to or below the 3,000 unit threshold between 1996 
and 2001 shall be treated as a small volume manufacturer and 
shall be subject to requirements for small volume manufacturers 
as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section beginning with 
the next model year. 
(2) A manufacturer which qualifies as a small volume 
manufacturer prior to model year 2001 is not required to comply 
with the sales requirements of this section until model year 
2001.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FRA is issuing a final rule requiring that railroads 
comply with specific maintenance, inspection, and testing 
requirements for active highway-rail grade crossing warning 
systems. FRA is also requiring that railroads take specific and 
timely actions to protect the travelling public and railroad 
employees from the hazards posed by malfunctioning highway-rail 
grade crossing warning systems. This action is taken in part, in 
response to a statutory requirement that FRA ``issue rules, 
regulations, orders, and standards to ensure the safe 
maintenance, inspection, and testing of signal systems and 
devices at railroad highway grade crossings.'' 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On January 20, 1994, FRA published a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) in which FRA proposed to require that railroads 
comply with specific maintenance, inspection, and testing 
requirements for active highway-rail grade crossing warning 
systems. FRA also proposed to require that railroads take 
specific and timely actions to protect the travelling public and 
railroad employees from the hazards posed by malfunctioning 
highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. A public hearing 
was held in Washington, D.C. on March 1, 1994. The comment 
period in this rulemaking closed on March 21, 1994. The final 
rule issued today reflects many of the comments and the testimony 
presented by 25 parties. 
FRA had issued an earlier NPRM on June 29, 1992 (57 FR 
28819), in which FRA proposed rules requiring specific and timely 
response in situations involving malfunctioning highway-rail 
grade crossing warning systems. A public hearing was held in 
Washington, D.C. on September 15, 1992. This prior NPRM did not 
address maintenance, inspection and testing of such warning 
systems. Due to comments received and an intention to widen the 
scope of the rulemaking to include proposed standards for 
maintenance, inspection, and testing pursuant to the mandate of 
49 U.S.C. 20134(b), (formerly  202(q) of the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431(q)) (Safety Act) as amended by 
section 2 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102-365)), an open meeting was held on December 11,
1992. Among the 
comments received was a joint submission from the Brotherhood of 
Railroad Signalmen, the Association of American Railroads, and 
The American Short Line Railroad Association. In addition to 
commenting on the prior NPRM, the labor/management group proposed 
specific regulatory language addressing both timely response and 
maintenance, inspection, and testing. 
The NPRM issued on January 20, 1994 reflected the 
consolidation into one rulemaking docket of the timely response 
rulemaking with proposed standards for maintenance, inspection, 
and testing of grade crossing warning systems. The NPRM 
generated a wide range of comments. Individual comments were 
received from: thirteen state regulatory agencies representing 
eleven states; five commuter rail authorities; three freight 
railroads; one union; and two industry associations. 
Additionally, a joint submission was received from the 
Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the American Short Line 
Railroad Association and the Association of American Railroads 
(``labor/management group''). 
This final rule amends 49 CFR Part 234, ``Grade Crossing 
Signal Safety'', and to a lesser extent, 49 CFR Part 212, ``State 
Safety Participation Regulations.''

This rule is a vital component of DOT's Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Action Plan which details six major Departmental
initiatives addressing highway-rail grade crossing safety and trespass prevention. These initiatives include:
enhanced enforcement of traffic laws at crossings; enhanced rail corridor crossing reviews and improvements; expanded
public education and Operation Lifesaver activities; increased safety at private crossings; improved data and
research efforts; and prevention of rail trespassing. These initiatives are comprised of fifty-five separate actions
the Department proposes to take. 
Part 234 was issued in 1991 (56 FR 33728, July 23, 1991) primarily as a reporting rule by which FRA received data pertaining
to malfunctions of highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. Part 234 is being amended by restructuring the existing
Part 234 into two new subparts, ``Subpart A_General'' and ``Subpart B_Reports'' and by adding two subparts, ``Subpart
C_Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction'' and ``Subpart D_Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing.''

Additionally, 49 CFR Part 212 is being amended to provide for the participation of qualified state highway-rail grade
crossing inspectors and apprentices within the State Participation Program. 
As we stated in the preamble to the early NPRM, we believe the risks to the travelling public and railroad employees
from grade crossing accidents resulting from system failures can be reduced. The active grade crossing warning systems
in place at the nation's highway-rail grade crossings are designed to fail in a ``fail-safe'' mode. If a component
or circuitry fails, the device fails in such a manner that the warning is activated, thus in theory preventing a highway
user from entering onto the tracks in front of a train. This system has worked successfully for many years. FRA does
not take issue with the basic design theory of ``fail-safe'' warning devices_they are true lifesaving devices. However,
the fail-safe feature loses its effectiveness as time goes by without repair of the warning system and its return to
fully functioning status. 
Failure of a device to activate when a train is approaching creates an obvious and acute risk. Indeed, an otherwise
cautious highway user could be entrapped by the failure to warn. Although activation failures are rare events and
railroads typically respond with appropriate dispatch, adding further impetus to appropriate diagnosis and response
is warranted by the critical nature of the risk. 
Therefore, FRA is issuing these amendments to 49 CFR part 234 in which railroads are required to take certain steps
when they are notified of either activation failures or false activations. These steps, designed to assure the safety
of the travelling public and railroad employees, are not unknown to the railroad industry. They require the railroad
to take the following three series of steps after learning of a malfunctioning warning system: (1) Notify trains and
law enforcement authorities of the malfunction; (2) take appropriate actions to warn and control highway traffic
pending inspection and repair of the system; and (3) repair the system. 
The rules do not establish a specific time frame for repair of malfunctioning warning systems. Setting a specific
repair time would necessitate establishing a schedule of various defects together with approved repair periods.
Not only is a system of this type very cumbersome to establish and monitor, it would not take into consideration the
operating environments of various railroads. Rather, safety is being maintained while the warning system is out
of service by requiring an equivalent level of warning and protection. That safety level will be ensured by the flagging
and speed restrictions contained in this rule. 
Safety at active grade crossings will be further ensured by the maintenance, inspection, and testing requirements
contained in this rule. 


Section-by-Section Analysis 


49 CFR Part 212 


FRA proposed revisions to 49 CFR Part 212, ``State Safety Participation Program'' in order to provide for qualified
state railroad safety inspectors to enforce the grade crossing safety rules issued today. 


Section 212.231 Highway-rail Grade Crossing Inspector 


As proposed, this section amends 49 CFR Part 212, ``State Safety Participation Program'' to create a new category
of ``Highway-rail grade crossing inspector'' within the State Participation Program. The proposal established
minimum qualification standards enabling state inspectors to enforce grade crossing signal system safety regulations
at 49 CFR Part 234. Additionally, this section as proposed provided that all state signal and train control inspectors
qualified under  212.207 are also thereby fully qualified under new  212.231. California Department
of Transportation, Division of Rail (CA DOT) commented that this proposed section was ``worrisome in its flagrant
approval of substituting schooling or related technical specialization, or completion of an apprentice training
program, in lieu of having four years of specific experience* * * .'' FRA appreciates CA DOT's
concerns, however, FRA has not found the qualification requirements, which mirror the requirements for state inspectors
in other disciplines, to be a problem. However, if any state regulatory agency deems it appropriate to impose more
stringent requirements for its inspectors, it is entirely free to do so. General qualifications of state inspection
personnel under the state participation program are governed by 49 C.F.R. part 212.201 which, in subsection (a) states
that ``this subpart [subpart C_State Inspection Personnel] prescribes the minimum qualification requirements
for State railroad safety inspectors, compliance inspectors and inspector apprentices. A State agency may establish
more stringent or additional requirements for its employees.'' Consequently, FRA has not modified this section
as suggested by CA DOT.

Final Rule



This section is being adopted as proposed, with the exception that language has been added to subsection (d) to clarify
FRA's original intent that state signal and train control inspectors can also enforce Grade Crossing Signal System
Safety Rules only if they have demonstrated the ability to understand and detect deviations from those rules. While
FRA anticipates that state signal and train control inspectors will have the technical expertise needed to ensure
compliance with these rules, they also need to be familiar with the regulatory requirements themselves. 



Section 212.233 Apprentice Highway-rail Grade Crossing Inspector 



As proposed, this section establishes minimum qualification standards which applicants must meet prior to being
enrolled in the inspector training program within the State Participation Program. FRA received no specific comments
regarding this section.



Final Rule 



This section is adopted as proposed.



49 CFR Part 234

Section 234.1 Scope 



As proposed, this section expands the scope of Part 234. The final rule issued today adds two new subparts to Part 234,
``Response to Reports of Warning System Malfunction'' and ``Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing.'' This section
is amended to include the subject areas covered by these new subparts. 

This section has been revised from that proposed to make clear that this part does not restrict a railroad from adopting
and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this part. In addition to prescribing
standards for the reporting of failures of highway-rail grade crossing warning systems, this part also prescribes
minimum actions railroads must take when such warning systems malfunction and imposes minimum maintenance, inspection,
and testing standards for such systems. The actions required by this part are the minimum actions which need to be taken
by a railroad in a specific situation. Thus, it would be acceptable for a railroad to determine that it will stop at every
malfunctioning warning system rather than cross at a reduced speed. Similarly, it is acceptable to test a crossing
system component every three months, rather than every 12 months as required by this rule. References in sections
234.105 and 234.107 to a railroad ``taking, at a minimum, the following actions:'' have accordingly been revised
to delete ``at a minimum'' inasmuch as the requirement has been placed more appropriately in section 234.1.


The NPRM contained a provision stating that ``[w]hen any person performs any function required by this part, that
person is required to perform that function in accordance with this part.'' After review, and in an effort to delete
unnecessary and confusing language, FRA will delete the proposed language inasmuch as section 234.6 ``Penalties'',
provides for appropriate penalties against any person who violates any requirement of this part. 



Final Rule 



This section sets forth the scope of Part 234. Part 234 imposes minimum maintenance, inspection, and testing standards
highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. This part also prescribes standards for the reporting of failures
of such systems and prescribes minimum actions railroads must take when such warning systems malfunction. This part
does not restrict a railroad from adopting and enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent
with this part.



Section 234.3 Application 



FRA did not propose any specific changes to this section. Rather, FRA posed a series of questions pertaining to the
application of these rules. FRA questioned whether the rules should apply to scenic or tourist railroads_those both
on and off the general railroad system of transportation. FRA stated that:





FRA does not believe that scenic railroads which are part of the general railroad system of transportation should
be treated differently than other railroads under the proposed rules issued today. The primary beneficiary of these
rules will be the motoring public. A motorist should have the same assurance of safety whether crossing the tracks
of a Class I railroad, a small short line, or those of a small scenic railroad. FRA invites public comment on this issue.




FRA further questioned whether these rules should ``be applied to crossings on trackage not located on the general
railroad system? Should the answer depend on whether the crossing is a public or private crossing?'' 



There was disagreement among commenters as to whether these rules should be applied to trackage not located on the
general railroad system. The Minnesota Department of Transportation stated, ``We believe the rules should apply
to all signals whether they are on public or private railroads, public or private roadways or whether the railroad
is connected into the rail network or not. The driver of a vehicle is seldom aware of facility ownership. The credibility
of crossing signals needs to be maintained regardless of where they are used.'' The New York State Department of Transportation
(NYS DOT) agreed to the extent that the rules ``should apply to all crossings of public roadways regardless of the status
of the railroad.'' However, the NYS DOT further stated that ``extension of the authority to include tourist and plant
railroad crossings on private property would not be appropriate, since motorist expectations are different on private
property and both train and vehicle speeds are generally low.'' This difference of opinion was also reflected in comments
received from other parties.

In analyzing this issue, FRA is confronted with a number of differing situations based on the different nature of vehicle
roadways (public and private) and differing railroad operations: freight and passenger operation on the general
system; freight operations within an industrial plant; tourist railroad on the general system; and tourist railroad
not part of the general system (see discussion below). 
Commenters generally agree that all crossings over general system railroads should be governed by this rule. We agree.
Thus, active warning systems on both private and public roadways crossing general system railroads are subject to
this rule. 
There was no consensus as to whether these rules should apply to public or private crossings over ``plant'' railroads.
While some commenters urged that all crossings under all circumstances should be governed by the rule, others, such
as NYS DOT and West Virginia Department of Transportation held the opinion that crossings over plant railroads should
not be subject to the rule. Unfortunately, FRA did not receive specific information or data supporting the views commenters
supporting either position. If FRA were to include plant railroads within the application of this rule, it would be
applying a regulatory regimen over entities which have historically not been regulated by the FRA. Although FRA has
authority to regulate this field of entities, it has not chosen to do so for reasons of both lack of a demonstrated safety
need and the need to apply limited FRA safety resources where they can be best utilized. As has been stated, plant railroad
operations typically involve low speed operations with small numbers of rail cars permitting relatively short stopping
distances. These operations typically also involve roadway crossings with relatively low speed vehicular traffic.
These reasons, together with the historical basis for not asserting jurisdiction in these situations leads FRA to
not assert jurisdiction over public and private crossings at such plant railroads. Of course, because FRA's regulatory
authority permits it to amend the applicability sections of its regulations so as to expand or contract the populations
of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations, if circumstances so warrant, FRA may assert such jurisdiction
in the future. 
As noted in the NPRM, FRA recently received a petition from the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, Incorporated on behalf
of tourist, excursion, and scenic railroads requesting the need for legislative and regulatory action for new regulations
tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. Pursuant to FRA's response to that petition, FRA has considered
the suggestions made by those parties in drafting these final regulations. There is a very wide range of operations
that could be considered tourist, excursion, or scenic railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.''
In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA recently settled on several principles
that will be used as current FRA guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist, excursion, and scenic
railroads, whether or not they operate over the general railroad system, except those that are (1) less than 24 inches
in gage and/or (2) insular. 
To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations
might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad is insular if its
operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of
any member of the public (except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a
trespasser) would be affected by the operation. A railroad is 

not

 considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) A public highway-rail crossing that is in
use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation;
or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, 

i.e.

, its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. 
Thus, the mere fact that the trackage of a railroad is not connected to the general system does not make the railroad
insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular theme parks and museums, a need to do
case-by-
case analysis in certain close situations still exists. 
Therefore, FRA has concluded that the requirements contained in this part should apply to each non-general system,
non-insular passenger railroad that confines its operations to lines that are not part of the general system (

i.e.

, it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular).
FRA believes that application of these regulations to non-insular passenger operations off the general system is
warranted by the risk to passengers associated with accidents involving heavy motor vehicles and is consistent with
FRA's ability to regulate and enforce safety standards in a cost effective manner. 
FRA recognizes that additional crossings equipped with automated warning systems may be found on plant railroads
and private freight railroads. Maintenance, inspection, and testing of these automated systems is the responsibility
of entities not otherwise regulated by FRA. As to plant and private freight railroads, these functions lie outside
the scope of this final rule, and state and local authorities will retain their existing authority to administer and
enforce appropriate requirements for the protection of the public. If data should be developed that indicates a need
for uniform national regulation of this subject matter, FRA may revisit this issue at a future time.

<DOCNO> FR940930-0-00211 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Based on the above, FRA is revising  234.3 to apply to all freight, passenger and scenic railroads which are part
of the general system of transportation. Because the present definition of ``highway-rail grade crossing'' contained
in  234.5 includes both private and public crossings, no change is necessary to provide that this part applies
to both private and public crossings over railroads which are subject to the rule. As a consequence, private and public
crossings over general system railroads will be covered by this part. Additionally, this part will apply to all non-insular
passenger railroads off the general system. FRA notes that a passenger railroad off the general system may be considered
non-insular under FRA's listed factors, but have only private grade crossings on its line of railroad. Because of
the non-insular status of the railroad, the private crossings will be subject to this rule. However, if based on an
analysis of the listed factors which determine insularity, a tourist operation is considered to be insular, private
crossings on its line would not be subject to this rule. 


Final Rule. 


This section provides that this part applies to all railroads except a railroad that exclusively operates freight
trains only on track which is not part of the general railroad system of transportation, rail rapid transit operations
conducted over track that is used exclusively for that purpose and that is not part of the general railroad system of
transportation, or a passenger railroad that operates trains only on track inside an installation that is insular.



Paragraph 234.4 Preemptive Effect 


FRA proposed adding this section to Part 234 to inform the public as to FRA's views regarding the preemptive effect
of these rules. While the presence or absence of such a section does not in itself affect the preemptive effect of this
part, it informs the public concerning the statutory provision which does govern the preemptive effect of these rules.
Section 20106 of title 49 of the United States Code, (formerly Section 205 of the Safety Act (45 U.S.C. 434)) provides
that all regulations prescribed by the Secretary relating to railroad safety preempt any State law, regulation,
or order, covering the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that
is not incompatible with a federal law, regulation, or order and that does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.

The California Public Utilities Commission commented that the ``Federal regulations do not explain the relationship
between the FRA rules and the various state rail-highway crossing regulatory agency rules. Federal rules which preempt
state regulation should clearly define a state regulatory agency's role.'' FRA views the terms of 49 U.S.C. 20106
as explaining such relationships. Any state regulatory agency rules covering the same subject matter as these regulations
issued today are preempted. However, section 20106 provides that a State may adopt or continue in force an additional
or more stringent law, rule, regulation, or order, relating to railroad safety when necessary to eliminate or reduce
an essentially local safety hazard, and when not incompatible with any Federal law, rule, regulation, or order, and
when not creating an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.

Section 20105 of title 49 of the United States Code, (formerly Section 206 of the Safety Act (45 U.S.C. 435)) provides
a mechanism by which a state agency can participate in the subject areas covered by today's regulation. That section
provides for state participation in carrying out investigative and surveillance activities in connection with
federal railroad safety rules. See also FRA's state participation regulations at 49 C.F.R. Part 212. 



Final Rule



This section explains that under 49 U.S.C. 20106 (formerly Section 205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45
U.S.C. 434)), issuance of these regulations preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering
the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that is consistent with
this part and that does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. 



 Section 234.5 Definitions 



The NPRM contained proposals to add three definitions to those terms already defined in the rule. Commenters generally
supported the proposed definitions contained in the NPRM. However, some parties suggested changes to two proposed
definitions, ``appropriately equipped flagger'' and ``credible report of system malfunction''. No opposition
was expressed to the definition of ``warning system malfunction.'' 



``Appropriately equipped flagger.'' 

As proposed, the definition of ``appropriately equipped flagger'' means a person other than a train crewmember who
is equipped with an orange vest, shirt, or jacket for daytime flagging. For nighttime flagging, similar outside garments
shall be retroreflective. The retroreflective material shall be either orange, white (including silver-colored
coatings or elements that retroreflect white light), yellow, fluorescent red-orange, or fluorescent yellow-orange
and shall be designed to be visible at a minimum distance of 1,000 feet. The design configuration of the retroreflective
material shall provide recognition of the wearer as a person and shall be visible through the full range of body motions.
Acceptable hand signalling devices for daytime flagging include STOP/SLOW paddles and red flags. For nighttime
flagging, a flashlight, lantern, or other lighted signal shall be used. The West Virginia Department of Transportation
recommended that flaggers' clothing, devices and training conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(``MUTCD'') in all respects. As we stated in the NPRM, we encourage railroads to provide equipment and training in
accordance with ``Standards and Guides for Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction, Maintenance,
Utility and Incident Management Operations'' issued by the Federal Highway Administration as part VI of the MUTCD.
However, given the industry-wide cost of equipping in full accordance with the MUTCD and training thousands of employees,
FRA is leaving to individual railroads the decision as to the extent of training and equipping beyond the minimum requirements
of this rule. The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commented that a uniformed police officer should be considered to meet
the requirements of this section. We agree. As noted in the NPRM, FRA does not intend to impose flagging equipment requirements
on police officers, including uniformed railroad police. Police officers are presumably trained and equipped for
traffic control functions. There is therefore no need for requiring any additional training or equipment. The American
Public Transit Association (APTA) suggested that FRA eliminate the requirement that flaggers carry specific signalling
equipment. APTA stated that ``it is important for flaggers to have their hands free to stay in radio contact with the
railroad, which may not be possible if the flagger has to carry items such as paddles. In the commuter railroad's experience,
once a flagger is at a crossing, motorists will obey the flagger regardless of the flagger's signalling devices.''
We agree that a motorist will obey the flagger, however a motorist must first identify a person as a flagger, and then
the motorist must be able to determine the instructions given by the flagger. FRA believes that the proposed requirements
provide the motorist with the necessary visual clues. FRA believes that the proposed requirements are the minimum
that provide safety for both the highway user 

and

 the flagger and thus are retained in the final rule. Maine DOT also recommended that ``reflective'' be used to describe
materials to be worn by flaggers rather than ``retroreflective.'' Retroreflective is used in the latest version
of the MUTCD. FRA will retain use of ``retroreflective'' to maintain consistency with the MUTCD. In addition to the
minimum standards established by this definition, FRA encourages railroads to provide flagging equipment and training
in accordance with ``Traffic Controls for Street and Highway Construction, Maintenance, Utility and Emergency
Operations'' issued by the Federal Highway Administration as Part VI of the MUTCD.

As stated in the NPRM, persons needing to be appropriately 
equipped are railroad employees other than a train crewmember, or 
others acting on behalf of the railroad, who flag highway traffic 
at grade crossings with malfunctioning warning systems. The 
requirement that persons be appropriately equipped does not apply 
to train crewmembers who dismount from a locomotive to flag the 
train through a crossing in an emergency situation, or to 
uniformed law enforcement officers. 


Final Rule


The definition of ``appropriately equipped flagger'' is 
adopted as proposed. 


``Credible report of system malfunction.''

 As proposed, ``credible report of system malfunction'' means 
specific information regarding a malfunction at an identified 
highway-rail grade crossing, supplied by a railroad employee, law 
enforcement officer, highway traffic official, or an employee of 
a public agency acting in an official capacity. 
APTA and LIRR stated that given the high frequency of 
commuter rail operations, commuter railroads consider all reports 
of malfunction as credible and respond accordingly. The American 
Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA) objected to the definition of 
``credible report'' as too narrow. The ATA believes that reports 
from individual citizens should be given the same weight by the 
railroad as reports from railroad employees and the police. FRA 
believes that a reporting system in which citizens notify their 
local police or highway department of malfunctions will be more 
efficient. Providing this initial screening process will reduce 
frivolous or fraudulent notifications in which members of the 
public may attempt to harass a railroad or individual railroad 
employee. Additionally, as discussed below in the analysis of 
 234.101, certain situations requiring repair or adjustment of 
the warning system do not trigger a railroad response under 
  234.105 and 234.107. Although those situations, such as dirty 
roundels, a burnt out bulb, a broken reflector, or a broken gate 
arm tip, although important, are not the type of situations in 
which the railroad should be expected to take the actions 
required under this rule, it is likely that such reports would be 
made to the railroad. Providing an initial screening process 
will better enable a railroad to quickly respond to those 
situations which safety factors clearly require the speedy 
response. 
FRA, of course, has no objection to railroads acting on 
reports from individuals and, indeed, as we stated in the 
preamble to the NPRM, ``we expect that railroads will, as they 
have traditionally done, investigate reports of malfunctions 
received from the public. After determining the accuracy of the 
report a railroad would then take appropriate action in 
accordance with regulations.'' The rules issued today do not 
prohibit a railroad from adopting internal rules that would 
trigger specific responses to an individual's complaint, but 
would only mandate the required responses to reports from 
``official'' sources. 
FRA is including within the definition of ``credible report'' 
information generated by an automatic reporting device. FRA has 
considered this inclusion in light of possible ``scope of notice'' 
problems. However, after consideration, FRA is of the opinion 
that even without this clarifying language, railroads would be 
required to respond to such reports under the rule as proposed. 
Section 234.101 mandates rules requiring employees to report 
instances of malfunctions. The employee responsible for 
monitoring such automatic devices must report such malfunctions 
under section 234.101. Such reports are within the definition of 
``credible report.'' By adding ``generated by an automatic 
reporting device'' to the definition, FRA will avoid any confusion 
in the industry as to what is expected when automatic reporting 
devices are used. 
In a comment related to credible reports, the ATA further 
recommended that railroads be required to post at the crossing 
the railroad's name, crossing identification number, and a 
telephone number for reporting malfunctions similar to the system 
now in place in Texas. The railroads have cooperated in 
establishing such systems in three States (Texas, Delaware and 
Connecticut), and FRA is finalizing a report reviewing the 
results of the Texas program. 
FRA agrees that establishment of a notification system is a 
desirable objective. The Department's Rail-Highway Grade 
Crossing Action Plan specifies that this issue will be further 
examined through a special safety inquiry. 
Public/private cooperation is needed to make this type of 
system workable. It is important that initial notification go to 
a public authority or an entity operating on behalf of the 
public. This procedure helps prevent the misuse of the 
notification system, while providing immediate notice to public 
authorities where steps should be taken to protect highway 
traffic pending the railroad response. Where citizens making 
reports do not note the inventory number or it is not posted due 
to vandalism, knowledge of the street or highway system may be 
necessary to identification of the railroad company and specific 
crossing.

Railroad cooperation is important to sort out valid reports 
from those that derive from misunderstanding of how devices 
function (as where a switching movement is occupying the fouling 
circuit on an industrial siding) and to ensure prompt response to 
valid reports. Clear identification of responsibility for 
posting and maintaining signage is also essential. 
Although this rulemaking is not the appropriate vehicle for 
resolving this issue, FRA will continue its examination of this 
issue through the safety inquiry noted above, with the objective 
of promoting the earliest feasible notification of warning device 
malfunctions. 


Final Rule 


The definition of ``credible report of system malfunction'' 
is adopted as proposed. 


``Warning system malfunction''

 As proposed ``warning system malfunction'' means an activation 
failure or a false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system. 
No opposition was expressed to this definition. 


Final Rule 


The definition of ``warning system malfunction'' is adopted as 
proposed. 


Section 234.6(a) Civil Penalties 


As proposed, this section amends the present ``civil penalty'' 
provision in effect for Part 234. The amendment brings this 
section into conformity with 49 U.S.C. 21301 (formerly  209(a) 
of the Safety Act as amended by section 9 of the Rail Safety 
Enforcement and Review Act). That section amended the definition 
of ``person.'' The clarified definition of ``person'' includes, but 
is not limited to, such entities as manufacturers and lessors of 
railroad equipment and independent contractors. Congress' 
purpose in amending the definition of ``person'' was to clarify the 
Secretary's existing power over entities whose activities related 
to rail safety by explicitly defining that authority. See 1992 
U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News, p. 879. Congress made it clear 
that the included list of ``persons'' subject to the Secretary's 
authority was intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. 
There were no comments pertaining to this proposed section. 


Final Rule 


This section is adopted as proposed. 


Section 234.101 Employee Notification Rules 


As proposed, this section requires that each railroad issue 
rules requiring employees to report to a designated railroad 
official, by the quickest means available, any warning system 
malfunction. This provision is intended to ensure that all 
employees report instances of false activations and activation 
failures (see definition of warning system malfunctions) and that 
such reports are made to the appropriate person. This section 
does not require that a railroad issue rules to require 
notification of maintenance or operational problems which are not 
false activations or activation failures. Examples of such 
situations not covered by this section would be dirty roundels, 
one bulb burnt out, a broken reflector, or a gate arm tip broken. 
While employees should report such situations to the railroad, 
those situations do not require a railroad response under Subpart 
C of this part. 
The labor/management group recommended that this provision 
be modified in recognition that railroad employees frequently 
report signal malfunctions to dispatchers, operators, and other 
railroad personnel who would not be categorized as ``railroad 
officials.'' The labor/management group thus recommended that the 
provision be revised to include other persons designated by the 
railroad. We agree. Broadening those persons to whom 
notification of malfunctions can be made will eliminate potential 
confusion in implementing the regulations. This section is being 
revised accordingly. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each railroad issue rules 
requiring its employees to report to persons designated by that 
railroad, by the quickest means available, any warning system 
malfunction.

Section 234.103 Timely Response to Report of Malfunction 

 234.103(a) 



Proposed subsection (a) requires that upon receipt 
of a credible report of a warning system malfunction, the 
railroad shall immediately investigate the report and determine 
the nature of the malfunction. The railroad then takes action as 
required by  234.207. 

Various commenters stated that use of the term ``immediately'' 
is inappropriate. New Jersey Transit states that ``[t]he 
requirement to `immediately investigate' a reported warning 
system malfunction in (a) adds vagueness to an otherwise adequate 
rule.'' The labor/management group also recommended deletion of 
the ``immediate response'' requirement. They commented that ``the 
term `immediately' may be too restrictive and would impose a 
standard which simply could not be achieved under all 
circumstances.'' We agree with the commenters that use of 
``immediate'' could present compliance problems when ``immediate'' is 
interpreted in its dictionary meaning. Immediately is commonly 
defined as ``without lapse of time; without delay; instantly; at 
once.'' We agree with the labor/management group that a more 
appropriate standard is provided by requiring a ``prompt'' 
response, which, while not requiring a virtually impossible 
instantaneous response, will establish a standard that a railroad 
must respond quickly to a credible report of malfunction. The 
final rule is revised accordingly. 



Final Rule 



Subsection 234.103(a) requires that upon receipt of a 
credible report of a warning system malfunction, a railroad 
having maintenance responsibility for the warning system shall 
promptly investigate a credible report of malfunction. Based 
upon the results of that investigation, and in accordance with 
 234.207, the railroad is required to adjust, repair, or replace 
any faulty component without undue delay. 



 234.103(b) 



As proposed,  234.103(b) requires that, until repair or 
correction of the warning system is completed, the railroad shall 
provide alternative means of warning highway traffic and railroad 
employees in accordance with this subpart. 

There were no comments on subsection (b). 



Final Rule



Because acceptable alternative means of protecting the 
travelling public and railroad employees are described in 
  234.105 and 234.107, this section is being revised to 
specifically reference those sections. 



 234.103(c) 



As proposed, subsection (c) provides that nothing in this 
subpart requires repair or correction of a warning system, if, 
acting in accordance with applicable State law, the railroad 
proceeds to discontinue or dismantle the warning system, provided 
such warning system not be left in place unless the railroad 
complies with this subpart. 

This subsection makes clear that nothing in these 
regulations forces a railroad to continually repair a warning 
system that, under State law, may be retired. However, a 
railroad must still comply with this part during retirement 
proceedings. This subsection also requires that even if a 
warning system has been retired under State law, until that 
system is physically removed, the railroad must comply with this 
part. This requirement will ensure that if a highway user sees a 
warning system at a crossing, he or she can rely on it to be a 
properly functioning system. 

There were no comments on this subsection. 



Final Rule



Subsection 234.103(c) is adopted as proposed. 



Section 234.105 Activation Failure 



Commenters raised a number of issues relating to this 
section. The labor/management group recommended that this section 
be modified by establishing a requirement for ``prompt,'' rather 
than ``immediate,'' action in response to a credible report of 
warning system malfunction. For the same reasons as stated in 
the discussion regarding  234.103, FRA is substituting 
``promptly'' for ``immediately'' in the final rule. As in  234.103, 
FRA believes this will establish a standard that a railroad must 
initiate the required warning efforts quickly and without undue 
delay.

The labor/management group suggested replacing the reference 
to ``motorist'' with ``highway user'' inasmuch as highway traffic is 
not limited to motorists. FRA agrees, and has changed the rule 
accordingly. 

The labor/management group also recommended that the phrase 
``at a minimum'' be eliminated from this section and  234.107. The 
group believed that the phrase is unnecessary and that it could 
be misinterpreted as implying that additional action could be 
necessary in response to a report of a malfunction. As stated in 
the discussion of  234.1, FRA intends that the rule issued today 
specifies the minimum actions a railroad must take in certain 
circumstances. Section 234.1 has been revised to make clear that 
this part does not restrict a railroad from adopting and 
enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not 
inconsistent with this part. Thus, given the revision to 
 234.1, references in  234.105 and 234.107 to minimum actions 
to be taken by a railroad have been deleted as unnecessarily 
repetitive. 

The labor/management group also noted that manual operation 
of defective warning devices was not addressed in the NPRM and 
suggested that such operation should be considered to be an 
``alternative means'' of giving warning, with the result that a 
train could proceed through the crossing at normal speed. FRA 
agrees that if a warning system is manually activated, a train 
can proceed through the crossing at normal speed. 



 234.105(b) 



FRA received a number of comments pertaining to the proposed 
requirement of  234.105(b) that ``the highway traffic control 
authority having jurisdiction over the crossing'' be notified of 
the crossing system malfunction. The Southern Pacific 
Transportation Company and related railroads recommended deletion 
of this requirement because it ``would be very difficult for the 
railroads to determine who to call, and to maintain such a 
database.'' The railroad further stated that ``it is not likely 
that highway traffic authority will respond due to their own 
shortages of staff, and even if they do respond, they may be 
unable to properly staff the crossing * * * .'' West Virginia 
Department of Transportation (WVDOT) commented that notifying the 
highway traffic authority would only be appropriate during normal 
business hours. WVDOT suggested that it would be better to 
notify the appropriate law enforcement agency. We fully agree. 
FRA always intended that notification be given to the public 
agency charged with traffic enforcement on the road, whether that 
be the local police, sheriff's department or state police. 
FRA's use of the term ``highway traffic authority'' was misleading 
and FRA is therefore replacing that term with ``law enforcement 
agency.'' The LIRR, which presently uses its own railroad police 
extensively in situations of grade crossing warning malfunctions, 
notifies the local police only when its own uniformed police are 
unable to respond or due to high volume of traffic flow at the 
crossing. FRA considers notification of railroad police who are 
capable of responding and controlling vehicular traffic to be 
equivalent to notification of the appropriate ``law enforcement 
agency.'' The final rule is being modified accordingly. 



 234.105(c) 



In response to a commenter's suggestion, this subsection is 
rearranged to be consistent with the arrangement of 
 234.107(c). Both subsections begin with the flagging 
requirements which permit train operations at normal speed. The 
subsections then address those situations which are progressively 
more restrictive on train operations. References in the 
following discussion are to the subsection numbers as proposed. 
The revised section number as it appears in the final rule 
follows in parentheses. 

As proposed, subsection 105(c) requires that upon receipt of 
a credible report of malfunction, a railroad must provide or 
arrange for alternative means of actively warning motorists of 
approaching trains, consistent with requirements detailed in 
paragraphs (1) through (4). FRA is deleting the phrase ``or 
arrange for'' in the first sentence of this subsection. A 
railroad may provide for alternative means of warning highway 
users by providing its own flaggers, or it may contract with 
another entity to provide that warning. FRA is deleting the 
above phrase to avoid the impression that merely arranging for 
such activities is an adequate response. A railroad's 
responsibilities under this provision are fulfilled only when the 
alternative means of warning highway users is actually provided. 

Paragraph 105(c)(1) (final rule_105(c)(3)) generated many 
comments. As proposed, it requires a train to stop before 
entering a crossing until an appropriately equipped flagger or 
law enforcement officer was stationed at the crossing. The 
proposal further requires that once the train was stopped, a 
crewmember must dismount to flag highway traffic to a stop. When 
safe to do so, the locomotive would proceed through the crossing, 
with the crewmember then reboarding. 

The LIRR noted that the proposed regulation does not cover 
the situation of trains being operated by one person. The LIRR 
stated ``it would not be in the best interest of our customers if 
the engine could not be moved until an appropriately equipped 
person arrived.'' The labor/management group also commented that 
in unusual situations there may be occasions where a train has 
only the engineer available to flag traffic: ``In those cases, we 
believe that under  234.105, the train would be permitted to 
proceed through the crossing after the train was stopped and it 
was determined that it was safe to do so.'' That interpretation 
is incorrect. FRA notes that nothing in the proposed language of 
 234.105(c)(1) permits a locomotive to proceed through the 
crossing without being flagged through that crossing by someone 
on the ground, nor does the labor/management group provide any 
basis for their contrary conclusion.

In addressing the issue raised by these commenters, we are faced with balancing the railroads' and commuters' needs
for timeliness with the safety needs of the motoring public. Requiring commuter trains to remain stopped until a flagger
or law enforcement officer arrives will undoubtedly inconvenience the commuting public. Similarly, freight trains
and intercity passenger trains will be inconvenienced, although on a smaller scale. We note however, that the requirement
to flag a crossing during periods of malfunction, while not universal, is not new. Rule 138(c) of the Northeast Operating
Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC) requires that if ``crossing protection devices are not functioning properly * * *
trains must approach the crossing(s) prepared to stop and not proceed until protection against highway traffic is
provided by on-ground personnel.'' The Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation (METRA), a commuter
railroad carrying 240,000 commuters daily, requires that in situations of activation failure, ``trains must be
advised to STOP and flag the crossing on both sides until the entire movement has cleared the crossing.''

After consideration of the comments and implications for both safety and railroads' on-time performance, FRA is
not revising the rule to provide an exception for trains operated by one person. Permitting a train to stop and then
proceed through a crossing without a flagger and without properly functioning automatic gates and lights sends a
confusing and potentially tragic message to a highway user. The highway user, seeing the train stop, may be encouraged
to cross in front of the train thinking that he or she has the right of way.

FRA believes the effect on railroads such as the LIRR will be minimal. As noted elsewhere in this discussion, FRA is
revising section 105(c) to permit trains to proceed at normal speed through crossings when one uniformed law enforcement
officer is present, rather than one officer for each direction of highway traffic. Due to this change, railroad or
local police will be better able to respond to crossing malfunctions, even in cases of multiple crossings malfunctioning.
The presence of one flagger will avoid the necessity of trains coming to a stop, and the presence of a uniformed police
officer will permit normal speed operations through the crossing.

The labor/management group proposed adding a provision to this section which would provide that after a train is stopped
at a crossing, if a member of the train crew determines that the warning devices are in fact operating properly, a crewmember
will not be required to dismount to flag highway traffic. The group proposes that the locomotive may then proceed through
the crossing and normal speed resumed after the locomotive has passed through the crossing. FRA takes no exception
to this procedure, although an additional regulatory provision is not needed. If a train crew, after being notified
of activation failure, finds instead that the warning system is indeed properly providing warning, the train may
pass through the crossing without flagging because, in essence, the malfunction, if one then exists, is a false activation.
It is difficult to determine whether the situation at the crossing was in fact a false activation, since the crew does
not know if the system was incorrectly warning of oncoming trains when no trains were approaching, the reality is that
the warning system is in fact providing warning to the highway user. Flagging in that situation is not needed since
the malfunction is not one of activation failure, but instead is, at most, one of false activation.

Section 105(c)(1) (final rule_105(c)(3)) is also being revised to permit a train to resume normal speed after the
flagging crewmember reboards the locomotive. This change will correct an earlier drafting oversight and will bring
this section into conformity with both the remainder of this section and  234.107.



Section 234.105(c)(2) (Final Rule_234.105(c)(1))



Paragraph 105(c)(2) (final rule_105(c)(1)) as proposed requires that if an appropriately equipped flagger or law
enforcement officer provides warning for each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the crossing
at normal speed.

The LIRR objected to the requirement that there be a flagger or law enforcement officer flagging both directions of
traffic before a train could proceed through the crossing at normal speed. LIRR presently uses uniformed railroad
police to flag crossings during malfunctions. Under present LIRR policy, one uniformed police officer controls
both directions of highway traffic at crossings with malfunctioning warning systems. Based on its experience and
the effect it would have on its police operations, the LIRR strenuously objects to requiring a flagger for each direction
of highway traffic. LIRR claims that it would result in unnecessary delays to LIRR's commuter trains, which operate
at up to 2-minute headways, each carrying up to 1300 passengers. The railroad also stated that requiring two police
officers to flag a crossing would have a significant impact on LIRR police operations by effectively requiring two-officer
patrols instead of the present patrols using one officer.

FRA made no distinction in the NPRM between flaggers and law enforcement officers and their ability to safely control
and direct vehicular traffic. Thus, under the NPRM, a train could proceed through a crossing with a malfunctioning
warning system only if an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer provides warning for each direction
of highway traffic. Based on the comments received, FRA has reconsidered and determined that due to a police officer's
traffic control training, the officer's ability to call for assistance if needed, and the motoring public's higher
level of responsiveness to a uniformed officer, the presence of one uniformed law enforcement officer at a crossing
will enable trains to pass through the crossing at normal speed. This section is being revised accordingly.

Maine DOT recommended that speeds be limited in all cases of activation failure. It recommended a 20 mile per hour limit
in those cases where a flagger is present for each direction of highway traffic. Such a limit would, according to Maine
DOT ``allow more stopping time for highway users, thereby simplifying the flaggers job and enhancing overall safety
at the crossing.'' We continue to believe that the presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer or the appropriate
number of flaggers can effectively warn highway traffic of oncoming trains. We are therefore not revising section
105(c)(2) (final rule_105(c)(1)) regarding train speed.



Section 234.105(c)(3) (Final Rule_234.105(c)(2))



Paragraph 105(c)(3) as proposed, provides that trains may proceed with caution through the crossing at a speed not
exceeding 10 miles per hour if an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer provides warning for
highway traffic, but there is not at least one flagger of law enforcement officer providing warning for each direction
of highway traffic. After the locomotive has passed through the crossing, normal speed may be resumed.

This paragraph is being revised to omit references to law enforcement officers, inasmuch as paragraph 105(c)(1)
of the final rule now provides that the presence of one law enforcement officer will permit normal speeds through the
crossing.

LIRR expressed concern regarding the maximum speed at which a train would be permitted to proceed through a crossing
under this paragraph. The representative of the LIRR testified that LIRR's ``operating speed under restricted speed,
* * * is a speed not exceeding 15 miles an hour, at which a train can be stopped within one half division
of range short of the next signal, an obstruction, switch properly aligned, looking out for broken rail or crossing
protection not functioning. We think that the restricted speed meets the criteria safely for moving trains over grade
crossings.'' The LIRR emphasized the increased disruption to commuter traffic resulting from the 10 miles per hour
limit compared to a limit of 15 miles per hour. APTA also opposed the 10 miles per hour limit, as did the labor/management
group and the Southern Pacific. Other views included those of New Jersey Transit which was in favor of requiring movement
at ``restricted speed'' rather than 10 miles per hour.

FRA rejected the use of ``restricted speed'' in the NPRM because it does not have the same meaning throughout the industry.
``Restricted speed'' has different meanings on different railroads, different speed limits ranging from 10 mph
to 20 mph and its meaning can be changed unilaterally by a railroad. Reliance on the requirement that the train be able
to ``stop within one-half the range of vision'' (a common element of the definition of ``restricted speed'') may be
appropriate in a wholly railroad context in which the concern is to avoid other trains and equipment and personnel
on the tracks in front of the locomotive. The requirement that a locomotive be able to stop within one-half the range
of vision is virtually useless when an object can instantaneously move from off the right-of-way onto the tracks well
within that range of vision limitation.

FRA will retain a specific and clearly understood speed limit for these situations. FRA has reconsidered its proposal
and is revising this subsection to provide a 15 miles per hour speed limit. We repeat that the requirements of these
sections are only minimum requirements. Under certain conditions, such as severe weather, sharp curves, or high
speed vehicular traffic, a railroad may wish to impose a slower speed during times of activation failure. 


Final Rule



This section requires that upon receiving a credible report of an activation failure, a railroad having maintenance
responsibility for the warning system shall immediately initiate efforts to warn highway users and railroad employees
at the subject crossing by taking certain actions. Paragraph (a) provides that, prior to any train's arrival at the
crossing, the railroad must notify the train crew of the report of activation failure and notify any other railroads
operating over the crossing. Paragraph (b) requires that the railroad notify the law enforcement authority having
jurisdiction over the crossing, and paragraph (c) requires the railroad to provide or arrange for alternative means
of actively warning highway users of approaching trains.

Paragraph (c)(1)(i) provides that, if an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for each direction of
highway traffic, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) provides that, if
at least one law enforcement officer (including a railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at
the crossing, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.

Paragraph (c)(2) provides that, if an appropriately equipped flagger provides warning for highway traffic, but
there is not at least one flagger providing warning for each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed with
caution through the crossing at a speed not exceeding 15 miles per hour. Normal speed may be resumed after the locomotive
has passed through the crossing. 

Paragraph (c)(3) provides that, until an appropriately equipped flagger or law enforcement officer is stationed
at the crossing to warn highway traffic of approaching trains, each train must stop before entering the crossing to
permit a crewmember to dismount to flag highway traffic to a stop. The locomotive may then proceed through the crossing
and the flagging crewmember may reboard the locomotive before the remainder of the train proceeds through the crossing.
Normal speed may be resumed after the crewmember reboards the train.

Paragraph (c)(4) has been redesignated  234.105(d). The body of this paragraph remains unchanged. This paragraph
requires that a locomotive's audible warning device be activated in accordance with railroad rules. This provision
addresses those instances in which a ``whistle ban'' may be in effect in a local jurisdiction. While there may be disagreement
as to the effect on safety of whistle bans, there can be little doubt that a ban on sounding a train whistle or horn should
be lifted when a grade crossing warning system is malfunctioning. In addressing whistle bans in this limited situation,
FRA does not wish to give the impression it approves of or encourages whistle bans in other situations. FRA is opposed
to local restrictions on the use of train whistles. See FRA Emergency Order No. 15, 56 FR 36190, July 31, 1991.



Section 234.107 False Activation



Inasmuch as the proposed requirements of this section were in many ways similar to the requirements of  234.105,
comments, our responses and reasons for them, are consistent with that section.

Final Rule



This section requires a railroad to take the same initial actions as it would take in cases of activation failure. Upon
receiving a credible report of a false activation, a railroad having maintenance responsibility for the warning
system shall promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and railroad employees at the subject crossing by taking
certain actions.

Paragraph (a) provides that prior to any train's arrival at the crossing, the railroad must notify the train crew of
the report of activation failure and notify any other railroads operating over the crossing. Paragraph (b) requires
that the railroad notify the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction over the crossing, and paragraph (c)
requires the railroad to provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users of approaching trains.
Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) provide for the alternative means of warning highway users. Subparagraph (c)(1) as
proposed in the NPRM has been divided into two parts to distinguish between the requirement that there be an appropriately
equipped flagger for each direction of highway traffic while flagging by one uniformed police officer is sufficient
even though there is more than one direction of highway traffic. Paragraph (c)(1)(A) provides that, if an appropriately
equipped flagger is stationed at the crossing providing warning for each direction of highway traffic, trains may
proceed through the crossing at normal speed. Paragraph (c)(1)(B) provides that, if at least one uniformed law enforcement
officer (including a uniformed railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at the crossing, trains
may proceed through the crossing at normal speed.

Paragraph (c)(2) provides that, if there is not an appropriately equipped flagger providing warning for each direction
of highway traffic, or if there is not at least one uniformed law enforcement officer providing warning, trains with
the locomotive or cab car leading, may proceed with caution through the crossing at a speed not exceeding 15 miles per
hour. Normal speed may be resumed after the locomotive has passed through the crossing. In the case of a shoving move,
a crewmember shall be on the ground to flag the train through the crossing. This section has been expanded from that
proposed in order to eliminate any possible confusion. Although we believe it was clear that this section as proposed
only applied to trains with a locomotive or cab car at the leading end, the section has been revised to be more specific.
Additionally, in the event of a shoving move, the rule has been expanded to require that a crewmember be on the ground
to flag the train through the crossing. This requirement is similar to requirements in both NORAC and the General Code
of Operating Rules pertaining to malfunctioning warning systems.

Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides the railroad an option of temporarily taking the warning system out of service
until repairs are completed. However, the warning system may only be taken out of service if the railroad complies
with the protection requirements for activation failures. From a highway traffic control and warning system credibility
perspective, it would be preferable for a railroad with few trains traversing the crossing to take a falsely activated
warning system out of service. The railroad would then comply with the activation failure provisions of  234.105
rather than  234.107.

Paragraph (d) provides that a locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in accordance with railroad
rules regarding the approach to a grade crossing, regardless of any State laws or ordinances to the contrary. 


Section 234.109 Recordkeeping



The labor/management group recommended that this section be revised to clarify that the recordkeeping provisions
apply only to ``credible'' reports of warning system malfunctions. We agree and have modified the section accordingly.

Both APTA and the LIRR claimed that the recordkeeping requirements of this section are redundant since under  234.9
railroads must file Form F 6180.83 which includes information pertaining to the time and date of the reported malfunction,
actions taken and the time and date of the repair. FRA notes that in an attempt to minimize paperwork burdens on the railroads,
proposed  234.109 did not require filing of reports. It requires only that a railroad maintain records pertaining
to compliance_records which we believe most railroads would keep for their internal purposes in any event. All that
is required by this section is that a railroad have the required information available for inspection. It is acceptable
for that information to be contained in a data base a railroad maintains in order to comply with  234.9's reporting
requirements. 

FRA notes that the requirements of  234.9(b), which required reports for each false activation, expired on
April 1, 1994. Those reports, which comprised the vast majority of reports required under  234.9, will thus
no longer be required. 

Section 234.9(b) requires that records referred to in  234.9(a) be retained for one year. Because various records
required by  234.9(b) will in some cases be made on different days, the retention period is one year from the latest
date of railroad activity in response to a credible report of malfunction. That date would typically be the date of
repair of the warning system. 

The labor/management group suggested that it be made clear that keeping records by electronic means is acceptable.
FRA agrees, and has revised paragraph (a) of this section accordingly. 



Final Rule




Paragraph (a) of this section requires each railroad to keep records pertaining to compliance with this subpart.
Records may be kept on forms provided by the railroad or by electronic means. Each railroad is required to keep the following
information for each credible report of warning system malfunction: location of crossing (by highway name and DOT/AAR
Crossing Inventory Number); time and date of receipt by railroad of report of malfunction; actions taken by railroad
prior to repair and reactivation of repaired system; and time and date of repair. 

Paragraph (b) requires that each railroad retain for at least one year (from the latest date of railroad activity in
response to a credible report of malfunction) all records referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. Records required
to be kept shall be made available to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107 (formerly section 208 of the Federal Railroad
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 437)). 



Subpart D_Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing Maintenance Standards 



Section 234.201 Location of Plans




The proposed rule requires that plans and other information required for the proper maintenance and testing of highway-rail
grade crossing warning systems, be available for use at each warning system location. 

The labor/management group and New Jersey Transit commented that the phrase ``and other information'' should be
eliminated from the rule. Labor/management group was concerned that ``other information'' has not been defined
by FRA and could include such things as manufacturers' manuals for various types of warning system equipment. The
parties note that 49 CFR 236.1, the equivalent requirement pertaining to signal and train control systems, does not
contain such a requirement. While complete consistency between the two sets of regulations is not necessarily appropriate
in every case, in this instance we agree that the phrase ``and other information'' is vague and unnecessary. It has
been deleted from the final rule. 



Final Rule




The final rule requires that plans required for the proper maintenance and testing of highway-rail grade crossing
warning systems be available for use at each warning system location. Plans shall be legible and correct to protect
against errors in circuitry connections.

Section 234.203 Control Circuits



The proposed rule requires that all control circuits that affect the safe operation of a highway-rail grade crossing
warning system be designed on the closed circuit principle. This requirement was intended to ensure that failure
of any part or component of the circuit will cause the warning system to activate (fail-safe principle). Interested
parties commented that not all elements of control circuits for all warning systems can be designed on the closed circuit
principle. The labor/management group also expressed concern that the proposed rule is a design standard and could
conflict with the language in the MUTCD. 
The final rule is changed to reflect a performance standard versus a design standard. 


Final Rule



The final rule requires that all control circuits that affect the safe operation of a highway-rail grade crossing
warning system shall operate on the fail-safe principle. 


Section 234.205 Operating Characteristics of Warning System Apparatus 


The proposed rule requires that operating characteristics of electromagnetic, electronic, or electrical apparatus
of each crossing warning system be maintained in accordance with the limits within which it is designed to operate.
The labor/management group supports the proposed rule. There were no other specific comments on the proposal. 
In order to comply with this section, each carrier should have specifications available which set forth the pick-up
values, release values, working values, and condemning limits of these values for all electromagnetic, electronic,
or electrical devices used in highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. 


Final Rule



The final rule is adopted as proposed. It requires that operating characteristics of electromagnetic, electronic,
or electrical apparatus of each highway-rail crossing warning system shall be maintained in accordance with the
limits within which the system is designed to operate. 


Section 234.207 Adjustment, Repair, or Replacement of Component



Paragraph (a) of the proposal requires that when any essential component of a highway-rail grade crossing warning
system fails to perform its intended function, the cause shall be determined and the faulty component shall be adjusted,
repaired, or replaced without undue delay. Commenters expressed differing views on this provision. NJ Transit found
the language consistent with FRA's signal and train control rules and stated that ``it seems adequately defined and
workable.'' The labor/management group also supported the rule as proposed. The Southern Pacific recommended that
the rule be clarified to make clear that it does not, in every case, require that repairs be made before the next train
movement. Paragraph (b) of the proposal which requires appropriate action under  234.105 or  234.107,
is written on the assumption that at least in some situations a train will arrive at the crossing before repairs are
completed. 
The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) concurred with use of the term ``without undue delay'' when concerning the
``total time it takes to make such repairs.'' However, the ICC stated that the rule should more specifically address
the amount of time it takes railroad signal personnel to begin on-site repairs after receipt of a credible false activation
report. ICC recommended that the time limit for response be set at two hours. Similarly, Washington Public Utilities
Commission viewed the phrase ``undue delay'' as too general or open ended. 
As was stated in the NPRM, ``[i]t is of paramount importance that remedial action begin as soon as possible after a credible
report of a malfunction is received by a railroad. In general, adjustment, repair, or replacement without undue delay
will require that remedial action be taken in as timely a manner as possible. Successful, practical application of
these general principles may be the objective of this regulatory proceeding that is most crucial to the safety of the
motoring public; and the safety of employees and rail operations is also implicated.'' Because of the great variety
of factors involved with malfunctioning warning systems, including the location of the crossing, frequency of train
movements, type of corrective action needed, availability of personnel, and other competing emergency situations
we are unwilling at this time to establish specific time limits for actions. FRA continues to believe that the requirements
of this section, taken together with the alternative protective measures required under   234.105 and
234.107 will provide the needed measure of safety.

Final Rule


Paragraph (a) of this section requires that when any essential component of a highway-rail grade crossing warning
system fails to perform its intended function, the cause shall be determined and the faulty component shall be adjusted,
repaired, or replaced without undue delay. Paragraph (b) requires until repair of an essential component is completed,
a railroad shall take appropriate action under  234.105 or  234.107.


Section 234.209 Interference With Normal Functioning of System


The proposed rule requires that the normal functioning of any system shall not be interfered with in testing or otherwise
without first taking measures to provide for safety of highway traffic that depends on normal functioning of such
system.
FRA requested that interested parties discuss the safety effect on warning systems caused by railroad equipment
standing or being switched within the system's approach circuit where the warning system is not designed to accommodate
those activities. FRA stated, ``[t]here have been instances of such cars and locomotives activating the warning
system for an extended length of time when there is no danger in crossing the tracks, raising the issue of credibility
at that crossing. If there are multiple tracks at the crossing, a warning system activated for a period of time due to
standing equipment may effectively entice a highway user to cross the tracks, when in fact a train may be approaching
on the other track. This situation may be exacerbated by reduced visibility of the approaching train due to the standing
equipment.''
The ATA suggested that the rule be revised to prohibit railroad equipment from being left standing or switched at a
crossing in a manner that interferes with the normal functioning of the warning system. Maine DOT noted that warning
system activations due to switching activity and standing equipment within crossing circuitry can be alleviated
by installation of motion sensing devices. The labor/management group concurred in the rule as proposed and noted
that most railroads have established procedures to be followed when testing or other work is performed near grade
crossings. The group also notes that it would be ``inappropriate'' to allow excessive or continuous operation of
warning devices while such work is being performed. In response to FRA's question regarding the effect of switching
operations and equipment standing near crossings, the group recognized that the issues presented are important
but believe a ``separate examination of the engineering and operating issues involved'' to be more appropriate to
determine if agency action is warranted. The group stated that ``as FRA is aware, railroads cannot operate without
conducting switching operations in the approaches of highway-rail crossings. This is a normal part of railroad operations
and there is no available technology which would completely eliminate the warning system activations which result
from these operations.''
FRA recognizes that normal switching operations will activate warning systems in many locations. We agree that there
is no realistic means to prevent this from occurring at all locations. However, standing equipment which is not involved
in switching activities can be prevented from activating warning systems. A warning system can be designed to accommodate
trains, locomotives or other railroad equipment standing within the system's approach circuit. Motion detectors,
time-out circuits, and similar technology can accommodate a railroad's operational needs while retaining a credible,
functioning warning system at a nearby crossing. If such technology is not in place, a railroad must take measures
to prevent activation of the nearby warning system. Many railroads presently have operating rules prohibiting just
such a result. Rule 103(D) of the General Code of Operating Rules provides that ``automatic crossing signals must
not be actuated unnecessarily by open switch or permitting equipment to stand within the controlling circuit.''
Similarly, NORAC Rule 138(b) provides that to ``* * * avoid unnecessary operation of automatic highway
crossing protection * * * [E]ngines or cars must not be allowed to stand longer than necessary.''

<TEXT>
 

FRA is therefore revising this section to provide that interference with normal functioning of the warning system
includes trains, locomotives or other railroad equipment standing within the system's approach circuit where the
warning system is not designed to accommodate those activities. Normal train movements or switching operations
are not considered to be interference with the warning system operations. This revision is directed to situations
such as when a car or other rail equipment is set out on an approach circuit thereby activating the warning system. If
the warning system at that crossing is equipped with a time-out circuit, cut-out circuit, motion detector, or motion
sensor, the system will deactivate, permitting traffic to proceed through the crossing. This provision affects
operations at those crossings not so equipped. Standing railroad equipment not involved in active switching will
not be allowed to keep a warning system activated.
Maine DOT suggested that FRA consider requiring track gangs performing maintenance activities within crossing
circuitry to disconnect the warning system when working. Many crossings are equipped with cut-out switches which
enable a worker to disable the automatic warning system in such a situation. FRA supports the use of these devices provided
they are utilized under appropriately rigorous controls established by the railroad. Other than use of such cut-out
circuits designed to enable a worker to safely disable a warning system, FRA is strongly opposed to allowing railroad
employees unfamiliar with warning system circuitry to actually adjust and modify operation of the warning system.
Allowing unqualified employees to modify the circuitry would jeopardize the safety of both employees and the travelling
public.


Final Rule


The rule requires that the normal functioning of any system shall not be interfered with in testing or otherwise without
first taking measures to provide for the safety of highway traffic. Interference includes, but is not limited to:
(1) Trains, locomotives or other railroad equipment standing within the system's approach circuit, other than normal
switching operations, where the warning system is not designed to accommodate those activities; and
(2) Not providing alternative methods of maintaining safety for the highway user while testing or performing work
on the warning systems or on track and other railroad systems or structures which may affect the integrity of the warning
system.
The intent of the rule is to ensure that railroads provide alternative methods of maintaining safety whenever the
normal functioning of a warning system is interfered with. Those situations include testing or performing other
work on the warning systems or on track and other railroad systems or structures which may affect the integrity of the
warning system. As stated in the NPRM, ``in some circumstances, nearby track work could activate a crossing warning
system. FRA does not believe that `taking measures to provide for the safety of highway traffic' in this context includes
chaining a gate in the `up' position while allowing warning lights to continue.''


Section 234.211 Locking of Warning System Apparatus


This section as proposed provides that highway-rail grade crossing warning system apparatus shall be secured against
unauthorized entry. The rule provides the carrier with discretion as to the specific manner in which the warning system
housings are secured. The rule requires that all external housings of warning system apparatus be kept locked or sealed.
This includes warning system houses, flashing light signals, gate mechanisms, and bell or stationary audible warning
system housings.
The labor/management group supports this section as proposed. There were no other specific comments.


Final Rule


This section is adopted as proposed.


Section 234.213 Grounds


This section as proposed requires that each circuit that affects the proper functioning of a highway-rail grade crossing
warning system be kept free of any ground or combination of grounds which will permit a flow of current equal to or in
excess of 75 percent of the release value of any relay or electromagnetic device in the circuit. This requirement does
not apply to circuits that include track rail, alternating current power distribution circuits that are grounded
in the interest of safety, and any common return wires of grounded common return single break circuits.

The labor/management group supports this section as proposed. There were no other specific comments.


Final Rule


This section is adopted as proposed.


Section 234.215 Standby Power System


The proposed rule requires that if alternating current power is used as the primary source of power, a standby battery
must be provided. The proposal also requires that an indicator or alarm be used to indicate when the alternating current
power is off. The proposal also requires that the battery be designed and maintained to provide at least 48 hours of
normal operations of the crossing warning device when primary battery-charging current is removed.
In drafting the proposed rule, FRA was addressing the most common type of crossing installation in the nation_a battery-operated
system in which the batteries are constantly being recharged by alternating current from a commercial or private
source. In these systems, if the supply of alternating current is interrupted, the batteries continue to operate
the system. If alternating current is restored before the batteries are discharged there is no interruption in operation.
However if alternating current is not restored in time to recharge the batteries before they are fully discharged,
warning system operations will be interrupted. FRA recognizes that systems other than the typical system addressed
in the proposed section are in operation or may be in the development stage. We do not want these rules to hinder development
of possible alternative equipment and systems.
Various commenters, including the labor/management group, Consolidated Rail Corporation, LIRR, NJ Transit, and
APTA, opposed all or part of the proposal. The Maine Department of Transportation and the New York State Department
of Transportation supported the 48-hour battery capacity provision. Labor/management commented that it would
be difficult and very expensive (approximately $180 million) to meet the proposed requirements for battery capacity.
Commenters stated that the indicator light or alarm requirement would be difficult and expensive to implement and
maintain because of the number of locations that would require installation (as many as 50,000) and the high probability
of vandalism to such installations. After reviewing the comments, FRA has deleted the power-off indicator requirement.
FRA recognizes that different crossings have different back-up power needs. A crossing tied into commercial power
in a large metropolitan area does not necessarily need 48 hour back-up power. If power were to fail in that area, the
failure would likely be for a relatively short period of time. This contrasts to crossings in rural areas where, if
there is a power failure, discovery of the failure itself may take a relatively long time. FRA is therefore revising
the rule in recognition of the variety of crossing situations. Availability of automatic notification of warning
system problems is also a factor. For instance, by linking warning devices to a digital data network, information
concerning primary power status and the unit's operational status can be almost instantaneously communicated to
a railroad control center. FRA wishes to provide flexibility for railroads and their suppliers to develop and deploy
cost effective technology that can provide advances in both safety and efficiency. Given those facts and the industry's
testimony about the capabilities of the back-up power devices being employed, FRA has shifted to a straight-forward
performance standard: FRA will require that a standby source of power be provided to ensure the highway-rail grade
crossing warning system continues to function normally if there is an interruption in primary power. We will not require
that a specific type of back-up power be available, nor will we establish a minimum period for standby capacity. Those
decisions will be left up to the railroads or the authorities installing new systems. Also left to a railroad or the
installing authority is installation of a conventional power-off indicator or indicators based on new or developing
technologies. While installation of these devices is optional, railroads remain responsible for ensuring that
warning systems remain operational.

FRA continues to stress that it is vital for a warning system to be equipped with a standby source of power to continue
providing warning to the highway user in cases of primary power loss. FRA will vigorously enforce this provision.
If investigation or testing reveals that there is no standby power at a crossing sufficient to enable the system to
continue functioning normally, FRA will take appropriate enforcement action. Similarly, if a power interruption
results in use of the standby power source to such an extent that power is depleted and the warning system is not operating
normally, FRA will take appropriate enforcement action under this section. If primary or standby power is not available
for any reason, FRA expects a railroad to provide portable power or provide warning for highway users in accordance
with   234.105 or 234.107.


Final Rule


This section requires that a standby source of power be provided of sufficient capacity to operate the warning system
during any period of primary power interruption.


Section 234.217 Flashing Light Units


The proposed rule requires that each flashing light unit be positioned and aligned in accordance with installation
plans. Several commenters, including the labor/management group, remarked that installation plans typically
do not include detailed specifications for the alignment of light units. Labor/management group recommended that
the rule be amended to require that light units be ``properly'' positioned and aligned. It is not practical to require
a specific distance for the alignment of each flashing light unit because of varying conditions (i.e., road curvature,
fixed obstructions, intersections, etc.) at each crossing. Maintainers have been ensuring proper positioning
of lights for many years without the benefit of alignment specifications. While a standard based on ``properly positioned
and aligned'' is somewhat vague, FRA is adopting the recommended language rule by requiring that each flashing light
unit be ``properly'' positioned and aligned. Compliance and enforcement of this section will be based on the good
judgment of both maintainers and inspectors. The requirement that the light be visible to a highway user approaching
the crossing has been added to this section. This basic requirement is being added to this section in lieu of the focusing
requirement contained in the NPRM's proposed  234.253.
The proposed rule also requires that each flashing light unit be maintained to prevent dust and moisture from entering
the interior of the unit. FRA has revised this section to require that reflectors, as well as roundels, be clean and
in good condition. The Wisconsin Central Railroad commented that it is impossible to keep dust out of roundels because
each light unit is vented. We agree; however, while it may be impossible to keep all dust out of roundels, excessive
dust will not be a problem if the roundels and reflectors are cleaned periodically.
Additionally, the proposed rule requires light units to flash alternately at a rate of 35 to 55 times per minute. The
labor/management group commented that the flashing rate is adequately addressed in the MUTCD. It further commented
that proper maintenance of the equipment which controls the flash rate is covered appropriately under other sections,
including 234.205. The Association of American Railroads Signal Manual, published in 1991 recommends a flash rate
of 45 to 65 times per minute for solid state flashers rather than the 35 to 55 times per minute as required by the MUTCD.
FRA does not perceive a safety advantage of one standard over the other. Therefore the rule will be revised to require
that light units flash alternately at a rate of 35 to 65 times per minute.


Final Rule


Paragraph (a) of this section requires that each flashing light unit shall be properly positioned and aligned and
visible to a highway user approaching the crossing. Paragraph (b) requires that each flashing light unit be maintained
to prevent dust and moisture from entering the interior of the unit. Roundels and reflectors shall be clean and in good
condition. Paragraph (c) requires that all light units shall flash alternately. The number of flashes per minute
for each light unit shall be 35 minimum and 65 maximum.

Section 234.219 Gate Arm Lights and Light Cable 


The proposed rule requires that each gate arm light be 
visible to approaching motorists. The rule also required that 
lights and light wires be secured to the gate arm. The 
labor/management group suggested that the proposed rule be 
modified to reflect a maintenance requirement. FRA concurs with 
this recommendation and is revising the rule to require that each 
gate arm light be maintained in such condition to be properly 
visible to approaching highway users. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each gate arm light be maintained 
in such condition to be properly visible to approaching highway 
users and that lights and light wire be secured to the gate arm. 


Section 234.221  Lamp Voltage 


The rule requires that lamp voltage be maintained at no less 
than 85 percent of its prescribed rating. The National 
Transportation Safety Board has recommended that FRA establish a 
standard for minimum lamp voltage at highway-rail grade crossing 
warning systems. There is a consensus that it is impossible to 
maintain lamp voltage at the full rating of the lamp, at all 
warning system installations. The State of Oregon Public Utility 
Commission commented that the rule should require that voltage be 
maintained at 95 percent of the lamp's prescribed rating. FRA 
agrees that 95 percent, or even 90 percent of the lamp's rating 
is a desirable voltage and should be maintained when possible. 
However, it is not a realistic minimum standard, particularly at 
locations where there is great distance from the source of the 
lamp voltage to the farthest lamp (i.e., lights supported by 
cantilever on expansive highway) or at older installations where 
light cable upgrades would be required at substantial expense. 
All other commenters were supportive of the 85 percent minimum 
requirement. The section will ensure that the lamp voltage is 
sufficient to provide suitable illumination of the lamp. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each lamp shall be maintained at 
not less than 85 percent of the prescribed rating for the lamp. 


Section 234.223 Gate Arm 


The proposed rule requires that each gate arm, when in the 
downward position, extend across each lane of approaching highway 
traffic and be maintained in a condition sufficient to be clearly 
viewed by approaching highway users. The proposed rule also 
requires that each gate arm start its downward motion not less 
than three seconds after flashing lights begin to operate and 
assume the horizontal position in a minimum of five seconds 
before the arrival of any train at the crossing. 
The labor/management group commented that the rule should be 
modified to reflect a requirement for maintenance of gate arms in 
accordance with the design of the warning system. They believe 
that it would be inappropriate to establish universal criteria 
for gate arm operation because of the variation in warning system 
designs, particularly at locations utilizing four quadrant gates 
or other special applications. While FRA does not want to impede 
the development or use of special applications, we do believe it 
is important to establish minimum standards for gate arm 
operations. FRA has revised this section to make clear that, in 
four-quadrant gate installations, the three second and five 
second requirements apply only to entrance gates, (the gates 
closest to oncoming traffic). 
New Jersey Transit commented that there is no demonstrated 
need for the requirement that gates assume the horizontal 
position at least five seconds before the arrival of any train at 
the crossing. We disagree. It is important for the highway user 
to have more than a minimal warning of approaching trains. We do 
not believe that sufficient warning is provided by only requiring 
that gates reach the horizontal position before arrival of the 
train at the crossing. The five second requirement helps to 
ensure that the highway user who attempts to cross at the last 
opportunity will be able to clear the crossing or vacate a 
stalled vehicle. It will not have any impact on the design of 
grade crossing warning systems. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each gate arm, when in the 
downward position, shall extend across each lane of approaching 
highway traffic and shall be maintained in a condition sufficient 
to be clearly viewed by approaching highway users. Each gate arm 
shall start its downward motion not less than three seconds after 
flashing lights begin to operate and shall assume the horizontal 
position at least five seconds before the arrival of any train at 
the crossing. At those crossings equipped with four quadrant 
gates, the timing requirements of this section apply to entrance 
gates only.

Section 234.225 Activation of Warning System 


As proposed, this section requires that a warning system 
activate to provide no less than 20 seconds warning time before 
the crossing is occupied by rail traffic. The labor/management 
group recommended that this section refer to a maintenance, 
rather than a design requirement. Accordingly, they suggested 
that the rule be modified to require that the system be 
maintained to activate in accordance with the design of the 
warning system. FRA has determined that while drafting this 
section in terms of maintenance requirements may be appropriate, 
there remains a need to maintain a minimum activation standard 
for warning systems. We note that the 20 second period is 
consistent with the design requirement of the MUTCD. In light of 
the labor/management group comments FRA is revising this section 
to provide that the warning system be maintained to activate in 
accordance with the design of the warning system, but in no event 
shall it provide less than 20 seconds warning time. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that a highway-rail grade crossing 
warning system be maintained to activate in accordance with the 
design of the warning system, but in no event shall it provide 
less than 20 seconds warning time. 


Section 234.227 Train Detection Apparatus 


Subsection (a) of this section as proposed requires that 
train detection apparatus detect the presence of a train or car 
when any part of a train detection circuit is occupied. In 
addition, subsection (b) of the proposed rule requires that when 
a grade crossing equipped with a warning system is fouled by a 
train or car, the warning system would continue to operate until 
such train or car clears the roadway. Subsection (c) of the 
proposal requires that when there are no other movements within 
the limits of the warning circuit, the warning system shall 
discontinue operation after the train or car passes the point of 
fouling the crossing. Subsection (d) requires that if the 
presence of sand, rust, dirt, grease, or other foreign matter is 
known to prevent effective shunting, appropriate action under 
 234.105 must be taken to safeguard motor vehicle operation. 
Various parties suggested that different portions of the 
rule be modified. The labor/management group recommended that 
the rule be modified to reflect the requirement for maintenance 
of train detection apparatus rather than addressing ``design 
standards.'' FRA has considered this suggestion and revised the 
rule to provide that the train detection apparatus be maintained 
to detect the presence of rail equipment in any part of a train 
detection circuit, in accordance with the design of the warning 
system. This new subsection (a) replaces proposed subsections 
(a), (b), and (c). It will serve the same purpose as the 
sections replaced, but will do so in a clearer and more 
straightforward manner. 
There were no comments regarding proposed paragraph (d) 
which provides that if the presence of sand, rust, dirt, grease, 
or other foreign matter is known to prevent effective shunting, a 
railroad shall take appropriate action under  234.105 to 
safeguard vehicle operation. This section, renumbered as 
paragraph (b), remains unchanged. 


Final Rule 


Subsection (a) requires that train detection apparatus be 
maintained to detect a train or railcar in any part of a train 
detection circuit, in accordance with the design of the warning 
system. Subsection (b) provides that if the presence of sand, 
rust, dirt, grease, or other foreign matter is known to prevent 
effective shunting, a railroad shall take appropriate action 
under  234.105, ``Activation failure,'' to safeguard highway 
users. 


Section 234.229 Shunting Sensitivity 


As proposed, this section requires that each train detection 
circuit that controls a highway-rail grade crossing warning 
system will detect the presence of a shunt of 0.06 ohm resistance 
when the shunt is connected across the track rails of the 
circuit, including fouling sections of turnouts. The 
labor/management group commented that the proposed rule should be 
modified to reflect the testing requirements of warning systems 
based on certain technologies. The group noted that certain 
types of constant warning time systems may not detect the 
``presence'' of a shunt. The group believes it would be more 
appropriate to require that the detection systems be maintained 
to detect the ``application'' of a shunt. The group believes that 
warning systems currently in use are designed so that they will 
meet that criteria. Southern Pacific also commented that 
constant time warning devices should be taken into account in 
drafting this section. 
FRA agrees with the commenters and has modified the section 
accordingly. ``Application of a shunt'' is replacing ``presence of 
a shunt'' in the final rule. In the interest of clarity the text 
``including fouling sections of turnouts'' has been deleted and ``of 
any part'' of the circuit added to the final rule. 
FRA notes that the labor/management group stated that they 
believe warning systems currently in use ``could be tested for 
compliance without using multiple shunts to simulate train 
movements or performing other complex tests of questionable 
value.'' We agree that multiple shunts may not be necessary to 
test for compliance with this section, however, multiple shunts 
may indeed be needed to perform operational tests. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each highway-rail grade crossing 
train detection circuit shall detect the application of a shunt 
of 0.06 ohm resistance when the shunt is connected across the 
track rails of the circuit.

Section 234.231 Fouling Wires 


This section is meant to assure the detection of a train 
operating through turnouts located within the limits of train 
detection circuits. If one wire or rail plug were broken, a 
dangerous condition would be prevented if the other wire or rail 
plug continues to be effective. 
This section as proposed requires that each set of fouling 
wires located in a highway-rail grade crossing warning system 
train detection circuit consist of at least two discrete 
conductors, and requires that each conductor be of sufficient 
conductivity and maintained in such condition to ensure proper 
operation of the train detection apparatus when the circuit is 
shunted. 
The labor/management group recommended that the proposal be 
modified to accord with existing technology. The group stated 
that ``certain train detection apparatus, particularly motion 
sensing equipment, is designed to prevent the system from 
assuming the most restrictive state under certain conditions, 
including some instances when the train detection circuit is 
shunted.'' We agree with the comments and, therefore, in lieu of 
requiring that the train detection apparatus be in its most 
restrictive state, have revised the section to require that each 
conductor be maintained in such condition to ensure proper 
operation of the train detection apparatus when the train 
detection circuit is shunted. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each set of fouling wires in a 
highway-rail grade crossing train detection circuit shall consist 
of at least two discrete conductors. The section requires that 
each conductor be of sufficient conductivity and be maintained in 
such condition to ensure proper operation of the train detection 
apparatus when the train detection circuit is shunted. 


Section 234.233 Rail Joints 


This provision provided that each rail joint located within 
the limits of a highway-rail grade crossing train detection 
circuit shall be bonded by means other than joint bars to ensure 
electrical conductivity. The labor/management group, the only 
party to comment on this section, recommended that it be modified 
to reflect maintenance requirements. The group also recommended 
that this section be changed to reflect that it apply only to 
non-insulated rail joints. FRA concurs in the recommendations 
and has revised the section accordingly. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each non-insulated rail joint 
located within the limits of a highway-rail grade crossing train 
detection circuit be bonded by means other than joint bars and 
the bonds shall be maintained in such condition to ensure 
electrical conductivity.

Section 234.235 Insulated Rail Joints 


This provision provided that each insulated rail joint used 
to separate train detection circuits within the limits of a 
highway-rail grade crossing shall prevent current from flowing 
between rails separated by the insulation in an amount sufficient 
to cause a failure of any train detection circuit. 
The labor/management group, the only party commenting on 
this provision, recommended that the section be revised to 
reflect the requirement for maintenance of insulated rail joints. 
FRA agrees and the final rule is revised accordingly. 


Final Rule 


This section requires that each insulated rail joint used to 
separate train detection circuits of a highway-rail grade 
crossing be maintained to prevent current from flowing between 
rails separated by the insulation in an amount sufficient to 
cause a failure of the train detection circuit. 


Section 234.237 Switch Equipped With Circuit Controller 


This section as proposed requires that when a switch 
equipped with a switch circuit controller connected to the point 
is interconnected with highway-rail grade crossing warning system 
circuitry, such switch shall be maintained so that the warning 
system can be cut out only when the point is within one-half inch 
of the full reverse position. 
The only party commenting on this section, the 
labor/management group, supported the proposal. 


Final Rule 


This section is adopted as proposed. 


Section 234.239 Tagging of Wires and Interference of Wires or Tags 
With Signal Apparatus 


This section as proposed requires that each wire be tagged 
or otherwise so marked that it can be identified at each 
terminal. Tags and other marks of identification shall be made 
of insulating material and so arranged that tags and wires do not 
interfere with moving parts of the apparatus. 
The only party commenting on this section, the 
labor/management group, supported the proposal. 


Final Rule 


This section is adopted as proposed. 


Section 234.241 Protection of Insulated Wire; Splice in Underground 
Wire 


This section as proposed requires that insulated wire be 
protected from mechanical injury. The rule prohibits insulation 
from being punctured for test purposes. A splice in underground 
wire will be required to have insulation resistance at least 
equal to the wire spliced. 
The only party commenting on this section, the 
labor/management group, supported the proposal. 


Final Rule 


This section is adopted as proposed. 


Section 234.243 Wire on pole line and aerial cable



This section as proposed requires that wire on a pole line 
be securely attached to an insulator that is properly fastened to 
a crossarm or bracket supported by a pole or other support. The 
rule requires that the wire not interfere with, or be interfered 
with by, other wires on the pole line. Aerial cable is required 
to be supported by messenger wire. Open-wire transmission line 
operating at 750 volts or more shall not be placed less than 4 
feet above the nearest crossarm carrying active warning system 
circuits. 
The only party commenting on this section, the 
labor/management group, supported the proposal. 


Final Rule 


This section is adopted as proposed. 


Section 234.245 Signs 


The proposed rule requires that each sign mounted on a 
highway-rail grade crossing signal post be maintained in good 
condition and visible to the motorist. Signs mounted on the mast 
could include crossbucks, ``number of tracks'' etc. The proposal 
also stated that standards for such signs are found in Part VIII 
(``Traffic Control Systems for Railroad-Highway Grade Crossings'') 
of the MUTCD. After consideration, FRA is deleting from this 
section the informational reference to the MUTCD. It is 
sufficient that the information is available through this notice.

<TEXT>
 

The labor/management group supported the proposal. The ATA 
recommended that railroads be required to post information at the 
crossing to expedite malfunction reporting. As discussed above 
(see  234.5) FRA is in favor of the posting of such information, 
but requiring such posting is beyond the scope of this 
rulemaking. 



Final Rule 



This section requires that each sign mounted on a highway-
rail grade crossing signal post shall be maintained in good 
condition and be visible to the highway user. 



Inspections and Tests 

Section 234.247 Purpose of Inspections and Tests; Removal From Service 
of Relay or Device Failing To Meet Test Requirements



The proposed rule requires that certain FRA-required tests be 
made to determine whether apparatus and equipment are maintained 
in a condition to perform their intended function. An electronic 
device, relay, or other electromagnetic device that fails to meet 
the requirements of specified tests will be required to be 
removed from service and not restored to service until its 
operating characteristics are in accordance with the limits 
within which such device or relay is designed to operate. 

The only party commenting on this section, the 
labor/management group, supported the proposal. 



Final Rule 



FRA is revising the first sentence of this section to 
eliminate the redundant and possibly confusing terms ``apparatus'' 
and ``equipment'' and to clarify which tests are being referred to. 
This section therefore provides that the inspections and tests 
set forth in   234.249 through 234.271 shall be made to 
determine if the warning system and its component parts are 
maintained in a condition to perform their intended function. 
Any electronic device, relay, or other electromagnetic device 
that fails to meet the requirements of tests required by this 
part shall be removed from service and shall not be restored to 
service until its operating characteristics are in accordance 
with the limits within which such device or relay is designed to 
operate. 



Section 234.249 Ground Tests 



As proposed, this section requires a test for grounds on 
each energy bus furnishing power to circuits that affect the 
safety of highway-rail grade crossing warning system operation. 
The rule requires that the test be made when an energy bus is 
placed in service, and at least once each month thereafter. 

The rule will assist in maintaining the integrity and safety 
of the warning system. As provided in  234.213, tests would not 
be required on circuits that include track rail, alternating 
current power distribution circuits that are grounded in the 
interest of safety, and common return wires of grounded common 
return single break circuits. 

There was no opposition to the proposed rule. The 
labor/management group, the only party commenting, supported the 
rule as proposed. 



Final Rule 



This section is adopted as proposed. 



Section 234.251 Standby Power 



The proposed section, entitled ``Battery voltage.'' requires 
that battery voltage be checked at the battery, with battery-
charging current removed, at least once each month to determine 
battery capability for instances of battery-charging current 
loss. There was no opposition to the proposed rule. However, 
FRA is amending this section to reflect changes to  234.215. 



Final Rule 



This section requires that standby power be tested at least 
once each month. 



Section 234.253 Flashing Light Units and Lamp Voltage 



The proposed rule requires that lamp voltage be tested when 
installed and at least once every twelve months, with battery-
charging current removed and with battery charging current 
restored, to determine the lamp voltage. Each flashing light 
unit would be required to be inspected at installation and once 
every twelve months for alignment, focus, and frequency of 
flashes in accordance with installation specifications. The 
exterior of each flashing light unit would be required to be 
inspected for dust and damage to roundels to ensure visibility of 
the light unit, at least once each month.

<PARENT> FR940930-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Labor/management recommended that the rule should be 
modified to reflect current practices in the maintenance, 
inspection and testing of flashing light units. Since the plans 
kept at crossing locations typically do not address the alignment 
or focus of flashing light units, they believe it would be more 
appropriate to have the requirements based on the installation 
specifications, which would reflect the design of the system. 
They commented that the term ``focus'' should be eliminated from 
the rule. Light units are focused initially in the manufacturing 
process, and the focus should be adjusted thereafter only in a 
shop environment. In accordance with the current practices, the 
group recommended that the requirements under subsection (c) 
include the words ``for proper visibility.'' This requirement will 
more appropriately address the intent of the rule with regard to 
the proper operation of the light units. We agree with the 
comments and have revised the rule accordingly. 



Final Rule 



This section requires that each flashing light unit be 
inspected when installed and at least once every 12 months for 
proper alignment and frequency of flashes in accordance with 
installation specifications. Lamp voltage will be required to be 
tested when installed and at least once every 12 months 
thereafter. Each flashing light unit will be inspected for 
proper visibility, and for dirt and damage to roundels and 
reflectors at least once each month. 



Section 234.255 Gate Arm and Gate Mechanism 



There was no opposition to the proposed rule. The final 
rule will remain as proposed. 



Final Rule 



This section requires that each gate arm and gate mechanism 
be inspected, and gate arm movement be observed for proper 
operation, at least once each month. Hold-clear devices (devices 
that keep the gate arms in the vertical position when the warning 
system is not activated) shall be tested for proper operation at 
least once every 12 months. 



Section 234.257 Warning System Operation 



The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. 
There was no opposition. The final rule will remain as proposed. 



Final Rule



Paragraph (a) of this section requires that a highway-rail 
grade crossing warning system be tested for proper operation when 
the warning system is placed in service and thereafter at least 
once each month and whenever it is modified or disarranged. For 
purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b), ``disarranged'' includes 
situations in which a relay, circuit board, or other electronic 
device is replaced with another; two or more conductors in a 
cable are severed; a cable or conductor in a train detection 
system is replaced with another; or wires are removed at the same 
time from more than one terminal of a relay, electronic device, 
terminal board, or other vital component of a train detection 
system. The extent of testing the warning system for proper 
operation will be dependent on the degree of modification or 
disarrangement. 

Paragraph (b) also requires that when a warning bell or 
other stationary audible warning device is used, it be checked 
for proper operation when installed. Thereafter it must be 
tested at least once each month and whenever modified or 
disarranged. 



Section 234.259 Warning Time



The proposed rule requires that a crossing warning system be 
tested for prescribed warning time at least once every three 
months. The labor/management group originally concurred in this 
section as proposed. The group later revised its comment. They 
state that it would be more appropriate to test warning time once 
each year, or when the warning system is modified in connection 
with changes in authorized train speeds. The LIRR commented that 
testing should only be required when a system is installed or 
disarranged. Labor/management and the Wisconsin Central Railroad 
request that testing of warning times using automatic recording 
devices should be an acceptable method of performing this test.

<TEXT>
 

FRA has reviewed its proposal in light of the comments received. After consideration, FRA has determined that extending
the testing period from three months to one year is appropriate in conjunction with requiring that testing be performed
whenever the warning system is modified because of a change in train speeds. FRA also notes that under the requirements
of  234.257, ``Warning system operation'', warning time must be tested if the warning system is modified in
such a manner that the warning time might be affected. FRA also agrees that electronic devices which accurately determine
actual warning time may be substituted for other tests.

The labor/management group expressed confusion regarding the type of testing permitted under this section. The
group stated that ``although the rule itself permits testing of the adequacy of warning time by calculation based
on the fastest allowable train speed, the preamble creates confusion by its reference to testing with an actual train
movement or `simulation of a train movement'.'' The group also stated that ``section 234.259, as written, permits
calculation as a complying testing technique * * * .'' This conclusion is unfounded. The section-by-section
analysis of the section stated that ``[testing] can be accomplished by observation of a train movement, if practical,
or by calculation and simulation of a train movement. Calculation alone is not testing. It is merely a determination
of design criteria. Only when the results of that calculation are combined with actions that determine that the mechanical,
electrical or electronic system functions as intended, can an adequate test be done.



Final Rule



This section requires that each crossing warning system shall be tested for the prescribed warning time at least once
every 12 months, and when the warning system is modified because of a change in train speeds. Electronic devices that
accurately determine warning time will be an acceptable means of meeting the requirements of this provision.



Section 234.261 Highway Traffic Signal Pre-emption



The proposed rule requires that highway traffic signal pre-emption interconnections, for which a railroad has maintenance
responsibility, be tested at least once each month. The pre-emption of a highway traffic signal requires an electrical
circuit between the control relay of the crossing warning system and the controller assembly of the highway traffic
signal. The railroad will only be responsible for the maintenance and testing of its interconnections. The State
of West Virginia noted that this section ``requires testing of the highway traffic signal preemption but doesn't
include any notification requirement. If the preempt fails to work and the fault is on the highway side of the equipment,
we need to be notified so that repairs can be initiated.'' Although it is beyond the scope of the present rulemaking
to require notification of state highway departments when a signal maintainer discovers a malfunction of the highway
traffic signal preemption equipment, FRA expects that such notifications would be routinely made. Nothing in this
rulemaking is intended to preempt any local requirements that mandate notification to appropriate officials. However,
we note that the railroad is not responsible for the controller assembly of the highway traffic signal and therefore
the signal maintainer is not always aware of a malfunction of such equipment.



Final Rule



The final rule will remain as proposed.



Section 234.263 Relays



The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. There was no opposition. The final rule will remain as proposed.



Final Rule



Paragraph (a) of this section requires that (except for certain relays listed in paragraph (b)) each relay that affects
the proper functioning of a crossing warning system shall be tested at least once every four years.

Paragraph (b)(1) requires that alternating current vane type relays, direct current polar type relays, and relays
with soft iron magnetic structure shall be tested at least once every two years. Paragraph (b)(2) requires that alternating
current centrifugal type relays shall be tested at least once every 12 months.

Section 234.265 Timing Relays and Timing Devices



The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. There was no opposition. The final rule will remain as proposed.



Final Rule



This section requires that each timing relay and timing device be tested at least once every twelve months. The timing
shall be maintained at not less than 90 percent nor more than 110 percent of the predetermined time interval, which
shall be shown on the plans or marked on the timing relay or timing device.

Timing relays and timing devices are essential components of time-out circuits which are primarily used for train
switching movements at warning system installations. A time-out circuit de-activates a crossing warning system
after a predetermined amount of time after a train movement has occupied the detection circuit in approach to the grade
crossing.



Section 234.267 Insulation Resistance Tests, Wires in Trunking and Cables



The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. There was no opposition. The final rule will remain as proposed.



Final Rule



Paragraph (a) of this section requires that insulation resistance tests be made when wires or cables are installed
and at least once every ten years thereafter. Paragraph (b) requires that insulation resistance tests be made between
all conductors and ground, between conductors in each multiple conductor cable, and between conductors in trunking.
Such tests must be performed when wires, cables, and insulation are dry. Paragraph (c) provides that, subject to the
requirements of paragraph (d), when insulation resistance of wire or cable is found to be less than 500,000 ohms, prompt
action must be taken to repair or replace the defective wire or cable. Until such defective wire or cable is replaced,
insulation resistance tests must be made annually. Paragraph (d) provides that a circuit with a conductor having
an insulation resistance of less than 200,000 ohms shall not be used.



Section 234.269 Cut-Out Circuits



The proposed rule requires that each cut-out circuit be tested at least once every three months to determine that the
circuit functions as intended. Labor/management group commented that the rule should be clarified by changing all
references of cut-out circuits to ``switch'' cut-out circuits. They asked for clarification concerning the type
of cut-out circuits this provision applies to.

For purposes of this section, a cut-out circuit is any circuit which overrides the operation of automatic warning
systems. This includes both switch cut-out circuits and devices which enable personnel to manually override the
operation of automatic warning systems.

Final Rule



This section requires that each cut-out circuit shall be tested at least once every three months to determine that
the circuit functions as intended. For purposes of this section, a cut-out circuit is any circuit which overrides
the operation of automatic warning systems. This includes both switch cut-out circuits and devices which enable
personnel to manually override the operation of automatic warning systems.



Section 234.271 Insulated Rail Joints, Bond Wires, and Track Connections



The proposed rule requires that each insulated rail joint, bond wire, and track connection located within the limits
of a highway-rail grade crossing train detection circuit be inspected at least once every three months. Insulated
rail joints are used to prevent current from flowing between rails. Bondwires and track connections ensure continuity
of a train detection circuit.

The labor/management group supported the proposed rule. The only other commenter on this proposal, the Wisconsin
Central Railroad, commented that the requirement for inspection every three months is nearly impossible to meet,
given the large geographical territories some signal maintainers have. Wisconsin Central suggests that this inspection
should be extended to every six months. Because of the effect that damage to bonds, track connections and insulated
rail joints due to vandalism, track equipment and other conditions can have on the integrity of the warning system,
it is imperative that those components be inspected more often than twice a year. FRA notes that the three month inspection
schedule is generally consistent with present industry inspection standards.



Final Rule



This section is adopted as proposed.



Section 234.273 Results of Tests



This section as proposed requires that results of tests made in compliance with this part be recorded on preprinted
or computerized forms provided by the railroad, or by electronic means, approved by the Associate Administrator
for Safety. Records must show the name of the railroad having maintenance responsibility for the warning system,
AAR/DOT inventory number, place and date, equipment tested, results of tests, repairs, replacements, adjustments
made, and condition in which the apparatus was left. Each record must be signed or electronically coded by the employee
making the test and be filed in the office of a supervisory official having jurisdiction. Additionally, the proposal
requires that records be made available to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107 (formerly section 208 of the Federal Railroad
Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 437). Each record must be retained until the next record for that test is filed but in no
case less than one year from the date of the test. If a railroad elects to use an electronic means for recording and signing
results of tests, such means must be approved by FRA prior to use.

Only two parties specifically commented on this section. Labor/management group and New Jersey Transit commented
that test results should be permitted to be retained at the highway-rail grade crossing location or at the office of
an official. FRA has determined that a more centralized location is needed for the retention of the results of tests.
In some instances the control housings of warning systems are destroyed when there is an accident at a grade crossing.
If the records of tests are also destroyed, an effective investigation of the accident would be precluded. Additionally,
retaining test results at the office of an official permits more effective monitoring of rule compliance by the railroad
and FRA. The final rule will not be changed as suggested. FRA is adding notice similar to that contained in  234.109
that records required to be kept shall be made available to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107 (formerly section 208
of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 437).



Final Rule



This section is adopted as proposed with additional language as stated above.

Regulatory Impact



E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policies and procedures, and is considered to be significant
under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because it initiates a new regulatory program.
This regulatory document was subject to review under E.O. 12866. FRA has prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket
a regulatory evaluation addressing the economic impact of this rule. A copy of the regulatory evaluation may be inspected
and copied in Room 8201, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

In the regulatory analysis accompanying the NPRM, FRA analyzed grade crossing malfunction data which had been submitted
in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR 234.9. The FRA's preliminary review and analysis of those data indicated
that there is a correlation between false activations at a grade crossing and accidents occurring at the same crossing
in the week following the false activation. Because the data had not yet been subjected to the careful testing and scrutiny
FRA would have wished had it had more time perform further analyses, FRA invited comments on the data and methodology
used in its analysis.

The AAR responded to the request that commenters review FRA's preliminary analysis. The AAR concluded that the data
did not support the FRA's preliminary conclusions. After a review of FRA's data and AAR's analysis of that data, FRA
agrees with the AAR's conclusion.

In its regulatory analysis FRA posited that the benefits of this rule would arise because the number of grade crossing
signal malfunctions would decrease due to compliance with maintenance, inspection and testing requirements of
Subpart D, grade crossings would be made safer during periods of warning system malfunction due to compliance with
Subpart C. FRA further estimated that the costs of   234.105 and 234.107 would be reduced because the railroads
would repair warning systems more rapidly under the provisions of  234.103.

It appears that activation failures now cost about $4.4 million per year in accidents. In these accidents the highway
user doesn't know a train is coming, enters the crossing and is struck by a train. This rule should reduce that cost to
about $1.3 million per year.

It is not as clear how many accidents are attributable to false activations. The FRA's best estimate, based on educated
estimates of its staff, is that false activations cause about $10.9 million a year in accident costs. In these accidents
the highway user thinks the signal is ``crying wolf'', ignores a valid warning, and is struck by a train. This rule should
reduce the annual cost to about $3.3 million.

This rule will prevent malfunctions, reduce their duration, and make crossings safer during a malfunction.

The total cost of this rule, discounted over twenty years, will be about $80 million and the total benefit will be about
$150 million. Benefits will be about 1.9 times costs.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



FRA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. There are
no substantial economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The rule contains information collection requirements. FRA is submitting these information collection requirements
to the Office of Management and Budget for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). The section that contains information collection requirements is  234.273. The estimated time to fulfill
the requirement of that section is five minutes for each record.



Environmental Impact



FRA has evaluated these regulations in accordance with its procedure for ensuring full consideration of the potential
environmental impacts of FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act and related directives.



Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
``Federalism,'' and it has been determined that the rule has sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. FRA recognizes that currently a small number of states have statutes mandating to some
extent maintenance, inspection and testing procedures for railroads operating within those states. In general,
this rule will preempt those requirements. In an effort to maintain state expertise and involvement in this critical
safety area, FRA is including grade crossing warning system inspection functions within its State Participation
Program. FRA has also provided in   234.105 and 234.107 that, in instances of grade crossing warning system
malfunctions, ``a locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in accordance with railroad rules.''
This provision preempts local ``whistle ban'' ordinances to the extent they would otherwise prohibit the use of horns
or whistles in such situations. This minimal intrusion into an area in which certain State and local governments have
become involved is necessary to protect the travelling public and train crews from possible injury or death at grade
crossings with malfunctioning warning systems. A copy of the Federalism Assessment has been placed in the public
docket located in Room 8201, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.

ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) commodity 
laboratory testing programs under the AMS Science Division were 
established in August 1993. In order to implement the testing programs under the new regulations, AMS codified the
agency reorganization of analytical testing services by consolidating and transferring functions from other Title
7 CFR parts related to testing to the AMS Science Division. An interim final rule to amend the regulations was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 10, 1994, and received one comment. The interim final rule provided for reduced laboratory testing fees for
certain dairy products based on various factors such as a decrease in minimum test times for certain products from
one-half hour to one-quarter hour, a decrease in expenditures for making some test preparations, and a decreased
number of procedural steps required for performing certain laboratory analyses. This final rule adopts as final
the interim final rule with one additional fee change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Executive Order 12866 and Executive Order 12778 



The Department has determined that this rule is not 
significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and it 
therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB). 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, 
Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have 
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or 
local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an 
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no 
administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any 
judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 



II. Effect on Small Entities 



The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has 
determined that this action will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601-612). The fees 
provided for in this rule reflect a minimal change in the costs 
currently borne by those entities which utilize certain 
laboratory services. The rule is designed to provide usual and 
reasonable fees for laboratory testing that are consistent with 
costs in time and resources to ensure adequate funding of the 
laboratory operations of the Science Division. 



III. Background 



On August 9, 1993, the agency reorganization of analytical 
testing under the Science Division and schedules of laboratory 
fees were published as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 
(58 FR 42408-42448) after receiving only one comment on the 
proposal. The fee schedules became effective immediately and 
were devised to have a single fee for the same test rather than 
assessing separate laboratory fees for different commodities and 
their products. 

The dairy product laboratory fees for 35 tests or 
combinations of tests that were listed in former regulations at 
7 CFR 58.44 were increased by large percentages in the 
August 9, 1993 final rule. As a consequence, the dairy industry indicated that it is burdened with testing fees that
cannot be assimilated into current purchasing contracts. 

The single test laboratory fees for other commodity 
products did not change as significantly as test fees for dairy 
products. Prior to the final rule implementation, the dairy 
testing fees had been revised only slightly since November 2, 1977 (42 FR 57301). The heavy volume of laboratory testing
of dairy products in the early 1980's associated with Commodity Credit Corporation purchases diminished the need
for periodic fee increases. However, the workload for laboratory testing of dairy products was reduced greatly beginning
in 1986. In addition, the dairy testing fees were carried over and not revised from 1988 to 1993 while the Agency prepared
a consolidated regulation for laboratory services within the Science Division and updated fees. Consequently,
when the new fees were placed in effect, the dairy industry faced substantial increases in testing fees. In response
to the various objections generated among dairy processors, and after further consideration of the matter, the agency
temporarily restored the dairy testing fees to the applicable charges and hourly rate in effect on April 17, 1989.
An interim final rule reducing testing fees was published and effective on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24318). That rule amended
7 CFR parts 58, 91, 93, 94, 95 and 98. It provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 9, 1994. Only one comment was
received recommending that the flavor fee be adjusted and made specific to dairy products.

IV. Provisions of the Interim Final Rule 


The minimum laboratory testing fee was reduced from 
$17.10 to $8.55. The original minimum fee published on August 9, 
1993, was based on current commodity product grading and 
inspection fees which specify a minimum one-half hour charge. 
However, some laboratory analyses applying to dairy product 
grading can be performed within a one-quarter hour and therefore 
would incur a corresponding $8.55 fee. The laboratory tests with 
a revised one-quarter hour charge are listed as follows: (1) 
Titratable acidity, (2) density or specific gravity, (3) scorched 
particles, (4) net weight per can, and (5) flavor. Analysis time includes the allotted periods for sample tracking,
reagent and standard solution preparation, sample preparation and laboratory bench analysis, cleanup, analytical
result determination and 
interpretation with supervisory review, and the time for issuing 
a test report. The individual laboratory test fee determinations 
in this rule must necessarily include the length of time spent on 
tests performed for quality control, quality assurance, and 
proficiency testing. 
The schedules of consolidated fees and charges for the 
single analyte testings were established in the rule published on 
August 9, 1993, based on the reasoning that there is, in general, 
comparable complexity of procedures and similar methodology for 
different commodities and their products. However, some standard 
methods or tests for the examination of dairy products have a 
dissimilar process for testing a given analyte, shorter 
procedures, decreased complexity of reagent and materials 
preparation, reduced analyst manipulations with samples and their 
derivatives, fewer measurements, and/or a lower degree of 
interpretation required. Consequently, these dairy tests are 
less complex and would justify a reduction of the fee. The 
laboratory fees for dairy products that were lowered in the 
interim final rule because the tests are less complex are as 
follows: (1) Fat (cheese), (2) fat (dairy products except cheese), (3) salt titration, (4) peroxide value, (5) free
fatty acid, (6) solubility index, (7) whey protein nitrogen, (8) vitamin A (dry milk products), (9) alkalinity of
ash, (10) antibiotic, (11) complete Kohman, (12) direct microscopic clump count, (13) proteolytic count, (14) coliform,
and (15) 

Salmonella

 Step 1. 


V. Discussion of Comment 


Since the issuance of the interim final rule on May 10, 1994, only one response was received from another agency within
the Department (the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service). That response persuaded the Agricultural
Marketing Service to reconsider its fee for flavor in the fee schedule in Table 3 of the earlier rule (58 FR 42408-42448)
of August 9, 1993. The response stated that the flavor test fee is too high for testing flavors in dairy products and
that a reduction of the flavor analysis fee for dairy products from a three-quarter hour charge to a one-quarter hour
charge or lower be considered. 
The flavor test charge of three-quarter hour or $25.65 was not specifically directed to dairy products nor modified
with the interim final rule issuance. Our records show that 8,900 flavor tests of dairy products were conducted in
the Science Division Midwestern Laboratory during Fiscal Year 1993. There was only a limited number of additional
flavor testings of dairy products by the Resident Dairy Graders. 
The Agency agrees with the respondent's recommendation regarding the dairy flavor test fee. Therefore, the flavor
test for dairy products in Table 3 is set at the recommended minimum one-quarter hour charge or corresponding $8.55
fee. Flavor tests for other products will remain at the three-quarter hour charge or $25.65. The one-quarter hour
charge is adequate for the dairy flavor test since a battery of other laboratory tests are usually performed in conjunction
with this sensory analysis which involve the same preliminary sample preparation steps. 


VI. Effective Date of Rule 


It is found that good cause that exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 because: 
(1) The interim final rule provided a comment period, and the only comment received was from an agency within the Department.

(2) That comment persuaded the Science Division to lower the dairy flavor test fee. 
(3) For the benefit of those using the test, the lower fee should become effective immediately.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule sets forth the requirements and procedures that govern the Department's Pre-Foreclosure Sale
(PFS) Procedure beginning in Federal fiscal year 1995 (October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995). The requirements
and procedures contained in this interim rule are based on the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration Program established
by a notice published in the 

Federal Register

. This interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received on that notice. It also incorporates changes
in the PFS requirements and procedures based on the experience of the Department under the Demonstration.

 

</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The information collection requirements contained in this interim rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). No person
may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with these information collection requirements until they have
been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced in the 

Federal Register

. Information on the estimated public reporting burden is provided later in this Interim Rule under 

Other Matters

. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street,

Background 



Sometimes, a mortgagor must confront the twin realities of not being able to meet his or her mortgage obligation 

and 

static or declining property values. Such a situation makes it virtually impossible for a financially distressed
mortgagor to sell the home and, using the proceeds, to fully discharge the mortgage debt. Foreclosure of the mortgage
is often the method of resolving these difficulties.

Over the past few years, much interest has been expressed by mortgagors and real estate agents in a transaction known
as the ``pre-foreclosure sale.'' In a successful pre-foreclosure sale, neither foreclosure nor conveyance of the
property to the Department occur. A third party buys the home from a defaulting mortgagor at its approximate fair market
value (with certain adjustments, as approved by the Secretary), which is less than the owner's outstanding indebtedness
at the time of sale. 

Section 1064 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-628) amended section 204(a)
of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(a)) to authorize HUD to pay a claim to a lender equal to the difference between
the fair market sale price and the outstanding indebtedness (with certain adjustments). A successfully completed
pre-foreclosure sale benefits the mortgagor, who avoids the stigma of foreclosure on his or her credit record, and
also benefits HUD, which can expect to save by not paying foreclosure-related costs. HUD also saves on maintenance
costs and marketing expenses for properties which would otherwise be conveyed to the Department following foreclosure.
Finally, mortgagees also benefit through incorporating this loss-mitigation technique into their overall loan
servicing, by frequently being able to file their claim for insurance benefits sooner, following a successful pre-foreclosure
sale, than they would following a post-foreclosure conveyance claim. 

On May 29, 1991, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

, at 56 FR 24324, a notice which announced a limited demonstration program to gauge the demand for, and the efficacy
of, pre-foreclosure sales as a means of assisting qualified mortgagors in avoiding foreclosure of their FHA-insured
mortgages and of saving the Department money. 

The Department has decided to implement the pre-foreclosure sale procedure nationwide by incorporating it into
the overall approach of servicing FHA-insured loans by FHA-approved lender/servicers. The Demonstration now concluding
has been successful in that the demand for this alternative to foreclosure was found to be very substantial; the efficacy
of the pre-foreclosure sale transaction was found to be cost-beneficial to HUD; and feedback obtained from participating
local HUD offices, program coordinators, mortgagees, homeowners and the general public, was quite favorable. By
expanding the options available to financially distressed mortgagors and not adversely affecting any mortgagor
rights or interests under existing FHA-insured loan servicing regulations, the Department has not only acted responsibly
toward the homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages, but also has operated with an eye to the cost-effectiveness of
its own policies and procedures. This interim rule will make pre-foreclosure sales an even more efficient servicing
tool by streamlining procedures and, in some respects, reducing the Department's cost of following this course of
action. 

Among the regulatory changes being implemented is a new  203.370, which provides for the payment of FHA insurance
benefits to mortgagees upon the filing of claims following successful pre-foreclosure sales. (It also contains
notification and eligibility provisions, noted below.) Other sections governing claim submission, calculation
and payment_24 CFR 200.155, 203.360, 203.365, 203.401, 203.402, 203.403, and 203.410_are being amended to recognize
the possibility of a pre-foreclosure sale as an outcome of the servicing of a defaulted mortgage. 



Public Comments 



The public was given 60 days to comment on the requirements and procedures set forth in the May 29, 1991 notice that established
the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration discussed above. Comments were received from 22 commenters: 12 mortgagees/servicers,
three counseling agencies, two real estate service companies, one national association of real estate sales professionals,
one quasi-governmental organization, one financial services company, one local HUD office, and one individual.
Below is a listing of the comments received and the Department's responses to those comments. 

1. With the exception of one mortgagee, all other comments had at least some positive aspects and were supportive of
the fact that HUD was engaging in an effort to mitigate losses through pre-foreclosure sales. Typically, commenters
believed that PFS was ``overdue,'' ``a much needed program,'' ``an attractive alternative to loan foreclosure,''
and that the ``program nationwide should help reduce foreclosures and encourage sales where the market is not strong.''
[two mortgage servicers, one real estate service company, one national association of real estate sales professionals]




Response: 

It is because of the overall response of this nature that the Department has decided to implement the pre-foreclosure
sale procedure nationwide. 

2. Seven commenters stressed the need for trained, proficient professionals to be involved in PFS; e.g., contractors,
program administrators, local HUD staff, or HUD Headquarters staff overseeing the Demonstration. [one national
association of real estate sales professionals, two real estate service companies, four mortgagees] 



Response: 

It has come to HUD's attention that a number of mortgagees have added, or otherwise identified, loss-mitigation teams
to their respective servicing staffs, in an effort to improve the responsiveness to mortgagor defaults and to apply
alternatives to foreclosure where feasible and cost-beneficial. HUD applauds and encourages these efforts; they
comport with the Department's own evolving philosophy regarding foreclosure avoidance and with expanding concepts
of ``prudent mortgage servicing'' and ``protecting HUD's interests.'' The Department expects that the benefits
of such an approach will be marked and far-reaching, extending not only to HUD, but also to homeowners and mortgagees.
In particular, the move to increase the mortgagees' role in HUD's pre-foreclosure sale procedure is being taken to
utilize the mortgagees' growing ability to manage or mitigate loss in a responsible fashion. HUD will provide sufficient
information and/or training to its own staff involved in pre-foreclosure sales to enable them to make prudent decisions
and to disseminate accurate details about the PFS procedure.

3. One element of the Demonstration that was criticized was the eligibility criterion requiring mortgagors to be
at least three months in arrears before they could be considered for the program. It was felt that this was counterproductive
to the goal of loss mitigation, and that in many cases, a case-by-case determination of need and qualifications could
be performed at virtually any time before allowing mortgagors to become program participants. Several commenters
urged that a comprehensive determination be made, using financial statements, etc. [six mortgagees]



Response: 

The experience of the PFS Demonstration has provided the basis for the decision to retain the eligibility criterion
pertaining to the defaulted status of a PFS candidate's mortgage loan. There must still be a determination made in
every case that the mortgagor is in default, and that, at a minimum, three monthly installments are in arrears. As a
practical matter, however, this means that a candidate for PFS could satisfy this criterion as early as the 62nd day
of default, i.e., because the third payment can be due and unpaid at that time. Retaining this criterion as the new nationwide
PFS procedure as implemented does keep the administration of pre-foreclosure sales from possibly impinging on servicing
requirements related to HUD's mortgage assignment program. Notification of the mortgagor of his right to apply for
assignment assistance from HUD (which mortgagees are required to perform at or after the third payment is due and unpaid),
will occur at a time when homeowners can choose between a course of action directed toward homeownership retention
OR one whose objective is to dispose of the property and relieve the mortgagor of his mortgage obligation. It is the
Department's intent that defaulting mortgagors make such an informed decision. Permitting participation in the
PFS procedure at an earlier juncture will be evaluated in the future, however, and could be implemented if found not
to be detrimental.

4. Another element of the Demonstration that received criticism was the allowance of a ten day period for review of
the proposed pre-foreclosure sale. [three mortgagees, one real estate service company, one individual]



Response: 

The ten day period for review of the proposed pre-foreclosure sale, as described in the Notice, was reduced to five
(5) working days during the Demonstration, and will remain a 

maximum

 of 5 working days when the function is transferred to the mortgagee. The period might be further reduced (e.g., to three
working days) after evaluating the experience of the nationwide PFS procedure.

5. Another criticized provision was the series of cash incentives payable to mortgagors who consummate a pre-foreclosure
sale after participating in the program, although several commenters did support this concept. Four commenters
opposed seller incentives [two mortgagees, one individual, one quasi-governmental organization]; three supported
them [one mortgagee, one real estate services company, one national association of real estate sales professionals];
one supported case-by-case determinations of amounts [a mortgagee]; and one suggested that cash ``incentives''
be applied toward property improvements only [a real estate services company]. One commenter [a mortgagee] also
criticized the expanded deed-in-lieu incentive as being over-generous and inappropriate. Another [a mortgagee]
suggested that mortgagors were prepared to pay money towards accomplishing a deed-in-lieu. A third [a mortgagee]
suggested that the mortgagor assign any and all refunds of insurance, etc. to HUD as a provision of enrollment in the
PFS program.



Response: 

Cash incentives for mortgagors are being reduced for the nationwide implementation of the PFS procedure. The amount
payable to a mortgagor who has successfully marketed and sold his home will be $750, with an additional $250 if the time
needed to go to closing is 90 days or less from the date the mortgagor was advised that he could participate in the PFS
procedure. HUD is retaining the policy of paying incentives to mortgagors in return for a successful pre-foreclosure
sale as a means of providing moving assistance or the promise of reimbursement for cosmetic repairs and maintenance
undertaken by homeowners who may still be experiencing financial problems. In addition, the Department wishes to
encourage the maximum number of interested and qualified mortgagors to take advantage of the PFS option, because
of the savings this generates for HUD.

The payment of $500 consideration for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to a good-faith participant in the PFS procedure
whose participation does not conclude with a pre-foreclosure sale is being retained. Since the commencement of the
Demonstration in 1991, HUD has raised the limit for cash consideration payable for 

any

 deed-in-lieu from $200 to $500. This was done to motivate mortgagors, and to encourage mortgagees to process deeds-in-lieu
in as many appropriate cases as possible, because of the saving HUD experiences in most instances. For mortgagors
who have made efforts to market their homes, payment of the maximum amount otherwise authorized will underscore HUD's
interest in seeing as many appropriate deeds-in-lieu processed as possible instead of normally costlier foreclosures.

The assignment to the mortgagee of all refunds due the mortgagor (for example from hazard insurance refunds) is being
incorporated into the application form for participation in the PFS procedure. The provision will apply to mortgagors
in the event their participation concludes with either a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu. The mortgagee will
deduct any such refunds received from the mortgagor from their claim for FHA insurance benefits submitted to HUD.

6. There was considerable support for payment of one sort or another to the mortgagee/servicer for the inconvenience
of administering the case to facilitate participation by the mortgagor in the PFS program. The method of payment varied
from calculating the claim using note rate interest, as though there were a formal forbearance in effect, to following
the FNMA $500-to-$1000 payment in each case resulting in a closed PFS. [three mortgagees, one real estate services
company, one quasi-governmental organization]



Response: 

With the commencement of the nationwide PFS procedure, HUD will pay an administrative fee to the mortgagees of $1000,
via the Single Family Claims process, for each pre-foreclosure sale that goes to settlement (``closes''). This should
provide the mortgagees ample motivation to utilize this servicing tool whenever it is appropriate to do so. It will
also defray mortgagee expenses related to the duties that must be performed with regard to all participants in the
PFS procedure, not just the successful ones. Payment of this administrative fee, and the amount paid, are subject
to change in the future, in the sole discretion of the Department.

7. One commenter suggested that HUD consider making it possible for original homeowners to benefit from the program
by allowing them to have their mortgages modified to reflect the current, lower value of the property, which would
result in a more bearable financial obligation for them. [one individual] Two others suggested that we engineer the
program to permit assumptions of the existing loans, after HUD has ``bought down'' the value of the obligation (involving
partial payoff of the mortgagee). [one national association of real estate sales professionals, one mortgagee]



Response: 

``Retention of ownership'' and assumption provisions are not being considered as part of the Department's pre-foreclosure
sale procedure. The PFS procedure is designed to result in an outright sale at the property's current value, and in
cancellation of the original mortgage instrument. If HUD were to implement the ``buy down'' recommendation, it would
in effect be insuring the purchase values of the properties and not the mortgages. Properties depreciate in value
for various reasons and it is not practicable for HUD to compensate homeowners for losses in that way. The Department
is exploring various other servicing activities designed to assist homeowners to avoid foreclosure, retain their
properties, and also to mitigate HUD's losses.

8. Another idea that received considerable support was the performance of a title search early on in the participant's
exposure to the program, to eliminate many candidates from the program who would not be approved for either a PFS or
a deed-in-lieu. [three mortgagees]



Response: 

The desirability of an early title search is stressed in the latest instructions being issued to mortgagees regarding
the PFS procedure. This is especially true in cases where suspicions are aroused that significant secondary liens
or encumbrances exist.

9. Several commenters supported the idea of relying on Brokers' Price Opinions (BPOs) either singly, severally,
or in combination with appraisals conducted under program auspices. [one quasi-governmental organization, two
mortgagees, one real estate services company]

Response: 

HUD is not closing the door regarding the use of BPOs, alone or in conjunction with more formal property appraisals,
in the future. However, at this time, appraisals are the only method of establishing property valuation under the
PFS procedure. The costs are higher for appraisals, but the reliability may also be greater. The Department also values
the fact that the appraisers will be credentialed as well as ``neutral'' parties, otherwise uninvolved with the sale
unlike the BPOs, which are frequently provided by real estate brokers that have a relationship with one or more parties
to the sale. This reliability and neutrality is especially important during the initial period when mortgagees are
becoming acclimated to their central role in facilitating pre-foreclosure sales. The Department may add BPOs to
the PFS procedure after evaluating the performance of appraisers, comparing their cost to BPOs, and taking other
factors into account. 

10. Several commenters criticized the ``70% appraisal of the indebtedness'' criterion and the ``90% net proceeds
of the appraised value'' criterion as unworkable in many areas, requiring delays for HUD office intervention to decide
whether to waive. Most wanted the formula to change, downward, or at least have the discretion to waive them placed
firmly in the hands of the coordinator. [three mortgagees] 



Response: 

When preparing the legislation which authorized HUD to engage in pre-foreclosure sales, Congress issued a strong
warning that HUD should avoid a ``fire sale'' atmosphere in administering the PFS program. The Department's experience
during the Demonstration supports retaining the 70% criterion, which is the ratio of as-is appraised value to outstanding
loan indebtedness. In rare instances, it will be possible for the local HUD Office to grant an inquiring mortgagee
a variance from the 70% criterion, based on a consideration of the facts of that case. 

The expectation of netting 90% of appraised value was an internal rule of thumb. That figure has been reduced to 87%
as more workable and realistic, given the typical transactional costs of pre-foreclosure sales during the Demonstration.
Mortgagees will be able to request a variance from the local HUD Office with jurisdiction over the property, to permit
a sale that would net less than 87%. 

11. Two commenters [two mortgagees] supported the idea of parallel processing of foreclosure while a participant
was enrolled in the PFS program. Two commenters [two mortgagees] were also concerned that the deadline for initiation
of foreclosure be explicitly lifted in cases involving participation in the PFS program, or else HUD would run the
risk of non-cooperation from mortgagees who would expect to be penalized for missing this deadline. 



Response: 

If participation in the PFS procedure is unsuccessful and does not result in a sale, a mortgagee has nine months after
default or sixty (60) days after the date of termination of PFS participation, whichever is later, to initiate foreclosure
or accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgagee must also meet conveyance time requirements. If the pre-foreclosure
sale does go to closing, neither foreclosure nor conveyance of the property occur; the mortgagee has 30 days after
the sale closing date to file its claim. If these time frames cannot be met, the mortgagee must file Form HUD-50012,
Extension Request, with the Loan Management Branch of the local HUD Office. 

Apart from the issue of obtaining extensions, and the customary timeframes in which to initiate foreclosure, and
submit a claim, it is still possible for mortgagees to opt to continue steps leading to foreclosure while a mortgagor
is engaged in marketing the property for sale under the PFS procedure. 

This decision must be weighed by the mortgagee in light of the cost-effectiveness (i.e., the ``loss mitigation perspective'')
of such actions.

 Proceeding with such steps in the face of a mortgagor's participation in the PFS procedure_which has a high likelihood
of ending either in the sale of the property or a deed-in-lieu_is 

frequently not justified

, because of the outlay of time and money required to accomplish them. In the meantime, the experiences of the PFS procedure
will be observed and evaluated. HUD may in the future direct mortgagees to desist from concurrently taking foreclosure-related
steps unless certain criteria are met. 

Mortgagees are reminded that they must always explain their concurrent foreclosure-related actions to the mortgagors
participating in the PFS procedure, because such actions may be misconstrued by the mortgagor and may jeopardize
the pre-foreclosure sale. 

12. There was a serious division of opinion as to whether mortgagees should be expected to participate in the mechanics
of the program. One commenter [a mortgagee] said that HUD shouldn't ask lenders to, or expect that they would, prepare
the PFS sale package for submission to the program coordinator. Two other commenters [two mortgagees] indicated
that it was appropriate for HUD to designate the mortgagee as a principal player in the administration of the pre-foreclosure
sale, as a means of loss-mitigation and appropriate loan servicing. 



Response: 

The difference of opinion over the appropriate level of mortgagee participation in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure
has been resolved by substantially increasing the mortgagees' engagement in the process over what was expected during
the Demonstration, and also by significantly increasing the administrative fee payable to mortgagees for facilitating
each pre-foreclosure sale. During the course of the Demonstration, many mortgagees did express a willingness to
expand the level of their involvement in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure. HUD has decided to implement its nationwide
PFS procedure by using the mortgagees in the central role of PFS ``facilitators'' because of the mortgagees' existing
loan servicing role; the savings generated by authorizing mortgagees to carry out the PFS procedure under express
HUD procedures and criteria; and the Department's evolving policy that mortgagees explore alternatives to foreclosure,
whenever appropriate.

13. Other recommendations included wider circulation of the program's 

Information Sheet

 [one mortgagee]; quicker nationwide implementation of the program [one mortgagee]; greater publicizing of the
PFS alternative to maximize the number of participants [one mortgagee]; combining mandatory notification by lender
with other mandatory HUD correspondence that gets sent to mortgagor [one mortgagee]; and relying on the lender for
homeownership counseling [one mortgagee]. 



Response: 

A new PFS 

Information Sheet 

will be distributed, and be generally available, to real estate brokers, housing counseling agencies, mortgagees,
and local HUD offices. Although nationwide implementation of the PFS option is now imminent, during the Demonstration
all local HUD offices other than those ``officially'' designated as being involved in the PFS Demonstration were
nonetheless able to activate the pre-foreclosure sale procedure ``unofficially'' in their jurisdictions, and
a significant number did. There will be more publicizing of the nationwide PFS procedure as it starts up. 

Many forms have been eliminated or streamlined, and the mandatory notification forms have been combined with other
correspondence that mortgagees must send to mortgagors. While it is not appropriate to depend exclusively on lenders
to provide homeownership counseling (there is a network of HUD-approved housing counseling agencies whose duties
include homeownership counseling), lenders are free to provide homeownership counseling and other information
related to pre-foreclosure sales if requested by the mortgagor to do so. 

14. Other recommendations also included allowing participants to select their own brokers independently [one national
association of real estate sales professionals], and also deciding on how HUD will determine ``qualified'' real
estate brokers to put on the program's referral list [one HUD field office]. 



Response: 

PFS participants 

are

 permitted to select their own brokers_the required list of cooperating brokers has been eliminated as too cumbersome
for mortgagees to produce and update, and also as possibly confusing to some PFS participants. Thus the issue of whether
and how ``qualified'' are the brokers on the list is rendered moot. 



This Interim Rule 



This interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received on the notice announcing the PFS demonstration
published on May 29, 1991, 56 FR 24324. It also incorporates changes in the PFS requirements and procedures based on
the Department's experience under the Demonstration.

Eligibility Criteria 



In order to be eligible for the pre-foreclosure sale procedure, a mortgagor must: 

(1) be an owner-occupant in a single family residence that is security for a mortgage insured under 24 CFR part 203,
unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary; 

(2) have an account in default with at least three monthly installments past due and unpaid; (The default must be the
result of a documentable involuntary reduction in income or an unavoidable increase in his or her expenses, including
job relocation.); 

(3) have been made aware of the assignment program, as discussed below under 

Notification of PFS Procedure

, and have been either turned down for it by HUD, or have decided not to apply for it; 

(4) have, at the time application is made to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale, a mortgaged property whose current fair
market value, compared to the amount needed to discharge the mortgage, meets the criterion established by the Secretary,
unless a variance is granted by the Secretary; and 

(5) have received homeownership counseling, as defined by the Secretary, and have executed a certification to that
effect. 

These criteria are contained in new section 24 CFR 203.370(c). 

The Department has decided to continue a policy begun during the PFS Demonstration, under which those mortgagors
who are small investors with only one FHA-insured mortgage (e.g., a former owner-occupant who may be renting out the
property) can be considered for PFS eligibility. Under no circumstances, however, will the pre-foreclosure sale
option be made available to ``walkaways'' who have abandoned their mortgage obligations despite their continued
ability to pay. Mortgagors determined to be eligible for, and who participate in, the pre-foreclosure sale procedure
will 

not 

be pursued for deficiency judgments by the Department. 



Use of Mortgagees To Facilitate Pre-foreclosure Sales 



The Department is adding the pre-foreclosure sale to the list of existing foreclosure alternatives that can be offered
by mortgagees to mortgagors facing financial difficulties and who meet certain qualifying criteria. Although offering
the pre-foreclosure sale option to a qualified mortgagor is arguably a part of ``normal'' servicing under FHA procedures
and guidelines which require mortgagees to act prudently and with HUD's interests in mind, the Department is encouraging
mortgagees to incorporate pre-foreclosure sales without delay into their overall servicing procedures by paying
mortgagees an administrative fee for each successful pre-foreclosure sale that they facilitate. Payment of the
administrative fee via the claims process is provided for in 24 CFR 203.402(t), which is being implemented as part
of this interim rule. 



Justification of Incentive Paid to Mortgagors 



The Department has decided to retain the practice used during the Demonstration of paying certain cash incentives
drawn from sale proceeds to qualified mortgagors who close a pre-foreclosure sale; however, the amount of this incentive
is being reduced from that which was used in the Demonstration. Also, in cases where a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure
follows bona fide but unsuccessful participation in the PFS procedure, the Department's policy of strongly encouraging
mortgagees to offer such mortgagors the full $500 consideration payable for a deed-in-lieu (authorized in HUD Mortgagee
Letter 93-16) is being continued. 

The Department is aware that other mortgage insurers and financial institutions have not authorized the use of a portion
of sale proceeds for consideration payable to the mortgagor, and do not otherwise reward mortgagors who engage in
a pre-foreclosure sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, beyond the fact that PFS necessarily precludes the foreclosure.
However, the proportion of pre-foreclosure sales occurring in these other agencies and institutions among defaulting
mortgagors is generally much lower than the level of participation which HUD would prefer for its nationwide pre-foreclosure
sale procedure. Furthermore, although the Department acknowledges that the avoidance of a foreclosure on their
credit records is a prime motivation for mortgagors to dispose of their properties via pre-foreclosure sales, HUD
has a number of other justifications for offering monetary consideration to participants in the PFS procedure.

_PFS participants must make considerable efforts and undergo significant inconvenience in seeking out buyers,
making the property presentable, and allowing the public access to their home as they attempt to reach an approved
sale transaction before the participation period has run. 
_Cash incentives for expedited pre-foreclosure sales occurring within three months of commencing the PFS procedure
represent a small portion of the estimated savings to the Department of interest that would otherwise have to be paid
to mortgagees as part of the insurance contract. 
_It is HUD's objective to maximize the number of interested participants in pre-foreclosure sales, because of the
estimated aggregate savings to the Department that successful pre-foreclosure sales transactions represent.
We estimate that the PFS-related consideration will be more than offset by the savings in pre- and post-acquisition
costs for the properties affected by participation in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure. 

_Mortgagors can request deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure without first attempting to execute pre-foreclosure sales
and might request deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure rather than the pre-foreclosure sale option, when they become fully
apprised of the efforts involved in the pre-foreclosure sale, as well as possible tax implications. If a mortgagor
meets prevailing criteria and the mortgagee is willing to cooperate, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure can occur. This
would benefit the mortgagor but would represent only modest savings to the Department. Therefore, it is in HUD's interest
to make the pre-foreclosure sale option as attractive as possible in order to maximize the number of interested participants.




Although payment of such consideration is warranted by the anticipated savings to the Department, HUD acknowledges
the need for vigilance to head off abuse of the process by opportunistic parties. 


Deed-In-Lieu of Foreclosure as Feature of the PFS Procedure 


At the time he or she requests to participate in the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure, the mortgagor is asked whether
there are encumbrances on the mortgage, or whether there are title problems of which he or she is aware. The mortgagee
should order a title search during the mortgagor's participation in the PFS procedure. The existence of encumbrances
or title problems may preclude or result in a refusal to permit either a pre-foreclosure sale 

or

 a deed-in-lieu. For those mortgagors who can deliver clear title, but who, despite a good faith effort, do not consummate
a pre-foreclosure sale, the mortgagee will customarily process a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure upon the failure of
the participant to execute a pre-foreclosure sale. A deed-in-lieu action will leave the mortgagor without a foreclosure
on his or her credit history. 


Notification of PFS Procedure 


HUD will circulate an 

Information Sheet

 on pre-foreclosure sales among mortgagees and housing counseling agencies, and the mortgagees and housing counseling
agencies will be encouraged to distribute the document among mortgagors who might be interested in, and possibly
qualified to participate in, the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure. It will contain basic information about pre-foreclosure
sales and will instruct mortgagors or others interested in PFS to contact the homeowner's mortgagee for more information
or an application. 
Mortgagees are required to notify mortgagors about the pre-foreclosure sale procedure by sending a prescribed communication
(HUD-426) when the mortgagors fall two payments behind, and a copy of the 

Information Sheet

 when the mortgagors become three or more payments in arrears. The requirement that mortgagees provide notification
of the pre-foreclosure sale option to mortgagors in default is contained in 24 CFR 203.370(b). 


Commencing the Pre-foreclosure Sale Procedure 


Once a mortgagor is found to be eligible to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure, and is so notified by
the mortgagee, the mortgagor may begin marketing the property. Section 203.356(b) requires mortgagees to notify
HUD of that change in status of the mortgagor. The mortgagee will also direct the mortgagor to retain the services of
a real estate broker in an attempt to market the property within the established time and price guidelines. These brokers
are prohibited from sharing a business interest with the mortgagee or mortgagor (seller). 
An appraisal will be ordered by the mortgagee from an appraiser who meets standard eligibility requirements for performing
FHA Single Family appraisals. The appraisal will contain ``as is'' and ``as repaired'' valuations of the property.
Reasonable costs for the property appraisal will be reimbursed through the FHA claims process. Section 203.402(l)
has been revised to include the cost of an appraisal performed as part of the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure. The Department
reserves the right, in the future, to authorize mortgagees to substitute or add the use of Broker Price Opinions (BPOs)
to the valuation process under the Pre-Foreclosure Sale procedure.

Homeownership Counseling Responsibilities 



Before a mortgagor's participation in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure can be approved by the mortgagee, either
a HUD-approved counseling agency located in the mortgagor's geographic area, the mortgagee, or the local HUD Office
will be available to do the following: 

(1) Provide mandatory ``homeownership counseling'' to the mortgagor considering the pre-foreclosure sale option.
This will include explaining the alternatives available to the mortgagor, including a payment plan negotiated with
the lender, foreclosure and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the assignment program (if still an option), and changes
in household income, expenses, or composition that might have a bearing on the ability of the mortgagor to retain ownership
of the property. The homeownership counseling and certification requirement is contained in  203.370(c)(5).


(2) Advise mortgagors considering a pre-foreclosure sale that they may wish to contact a financial or tax counselor
to assess the specific tax consequences (if any) to them of a pre-foreclosure sale. 

(3) Assist in executing certifications for the mortgagors to sign before they can be permitted to participate in the
pre-foreclosure sale procedure. These certifications shall include statements that:

 


(a) Homeownership counseling has been received; 

(b) The mortgagor understands that any proposed pre-foreclosure sale must be an ``arm's length'' transaction; i.e.,
a sale between two unrelated parties that is characterized by a selling price and other conditions which would prevail
in an open market environment, without hidden terms or special understandings between any of the parties connected
to the transaction, including the appraiser, sales agent, closing agent and mortgagee; and 

(c) If the mortgagor has not made application for mortgage assignment, that the assignment program has been explained
to him and that he desires to waive any right he has to apply for the program. The provision regarding consideration
of (and for) mortgage assignment is contained in 24 CFR 203.370(c)(3). (This waiver applies to assignment rights
arising only from his present mortgage default, and only if he is permitted to participate in the Pre-foreclosure
Sale procedure.) 



Responsibilities of the Real Estate Broker or the Mortgagor's Attorney 



The real estate broker or the mortgagor's attorney should forward to the mortgagee a copy of the contract of sale made
conditional upon approval by HUD or the mortgagee, acting under the Secretary's instructions. The contract package
should identify the sales commission, and include the necessary certifications (if they are in the broker's or attorney's
possession) that have been signed by the mortgagor. The mortgagee will review the package and render a decision within
five (5) days of receiving the completed package. 



Monitoring Responsibilities of HUD Personnel 



The determination by the mortgagee of the mortgagor's eligibility to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu,
as well as the mortgagee's final approval of a proposed sale, shall be reviewed by the appropriate HUD personnel. These
reviews may occur at any time, and will be performed on-site by local HUD office or Headquarters personnel. Mortgagees'
submission of data pertaining to individual participants in the PFS procedure, as well as monthly Single Family Default
Monitoring System (SFDMS) reports, will also be subject to review. The speed and effectiveness with which mortgagees
incorporate the pre-foreclosure sale procedure into their overall servicing techniques will be evaluated on-site
during mortgagee reviews conducted by HUD staff. A pre-foreclosure sale component will also be incorporated into
HUD's regular claim reviews. 



General Responsibilities of Mortgagees 



(1) Mortgagees will be responsible for implementing correct notification procedures (in particular, sending appropriate
notices to defaulting mortgagors and providing information as requested to mortgagors about the PFS procedure).


(2) Mortgagees will be responsible for determining the eligibility of mortgagors to participate in the pre-foreclosure
sale procedure, including those whose assignment applications are turned down or for whom the opportunity for assignment
has expired or been waived. 

(3) Mortgagees will be responsible for responsive and timely servicing in taking the necessary steps for, and cooperating
with all aspects of, the PFS procedure, including the expediting of sale transactions; the processing of deeds-in-lieu
of foreclosure from qualified participants who did not close a pre-foreclosure sale despite a good faith effort;
and the timely resumption of appropriate servicing of those loans when participation in the PFS procedure ends and
neither a sale nor a deed-in-lieu has occurred. 

(4) The mortgagee will have the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to determine the mortgagor's participation deadline
(up to four months to obtain a signed contract of sale, or up to six months to go to closing) when it determines that granting
that period is in the best interest of the Department.

<TEXT>
 

(5) In determining the eligibility of a mortgagor to participate in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure, the mortgagee
shall arrange for the valuation of the property according to instructions issued by the Secretary, to assist in determining
whether the property's as-is appraised value is at least 70% of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness (principal
and accrued interest only) at the time application is made to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale. In cases where the appraised
value is less than 70% of the outstanding debt, the mortgagee must obtain local HUD Office approval for a ``variance''
from this criterion before the mortgagor can be permitted to participate in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure.

(6) The offer to purchase the property should net HUD at least 87% of the appraised value of the property. However, the
mortgagee may exercise discretion in cases where the net proceeds would be less than 87%, if the mortgagee believes
that it would still be in HUD's best interest to permit the sale to occur. In such cases, the mortgagee must refer the
matter to the Chief of Loan Management at the local HUD Office with the recommendation that the sale be approved by granting
a ``variance'' in that case from the ``net proceeds'' criterion. 


Consideration 


Mortgagors who qualify for the pre-foreclosure sale procedure and who close an approved sale shall be able to retain
from the sales proceeds before disbursement to the mortgagee, the base amount of $750 (seven hundred fifty dollars).

In addition to the base amount, the mortgagor will be able to retain an additional amount of $250 (two hundred fifty
dollars) from the proceeds of sale if the closing of an approved pre-foreclosure sale occurs within three (3) months
of the commencement of the mortgagor's participation in the pre-foreclosure sale procedure (i.e., from the time
the mortgagor is advised in writing that he may participate in the procedure), 
If, despite a good faith effort_as determined by the mortgagee_a property does not sell during the mortgagor's period
of participation in the PFS procedure, the mortgagee will authorize a title search of the participant's mortgage
for title problems and encumbrances (if one was not already performed during the period of participation). If any
obstacles to obtaining clear and marketable title are resolved pursuant to instructions from the Secretary, the
mortgagee will process a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure from the mortgagor. The mortgagee shall follow prescribed
methods of processing the deed-in-lieu and will disburse consideration in the amount of $500 to the mortgagor upon
completion of the deed-in-lieu transaction. This consideration is 100% reimbursable to the mortgagee through the
FHA claims process. 


Other Provisions 


(1) All sales contracts submitted for consideration under the pre-foreclosure sale procedure shall contain a clause
which provides that HUD approval (directly or through the mortgagee, as prescribed by the Secretary) is a pre-condition
of the sale. 
(2) Purchasers in approved pre-foreclosure sales may qualify for FHA mortgage insurance. 


The Closing of the Pre-Foreclosure Sale; Payment of Claims 


Prior to closing the sale: 
(1) The mortgagee will provide to the Closing Agent a list of those parties entitled to receive financial consideration
and the amounts payable out of sale proceeds. 
(2) The Closing Agent will calculate the net sale proceeds and communicate this data to the mortgagee, so that the mortgagee
can ascertain that the actual terms of the transaction are in accordance with the proposed sale that the mortgagee
had approved earlier. 
If the mortgagee approves the transaction, and closing occurs, the Closing Agent will pay the consideration set forth
in the list previously provided by the mortgagee, and will send the net proceeds of sale and a form HUD-1 to the
mortgagee. 
Upon receipt of the payoff funds, the mortgagee will file a claim for the balance due to it under the terms of the contract
for insurance. In addition, an administrative fee of $1,000 will be payable, as part of the claim, to the mortgagee
for each approved pre-foreclosure sale that goes to closing. Payment of this fee, which is not subject to debenture
interest, will be made under the provisions of Section 204(a) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(a)), as amended
by Section 1064 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-628).

For proposed pre-foreclosure sales that ``fall through,'' or are sought without positive result, the mortgagee
should file its claim under existing procedures for conveyance claims, and in compliance with any additional provisions
which may be applicable to conveyance claims that follow a mortgagor's unsuccessful participation in the PFS procedure.
Section 203.355 has been amended to include definitions of the ``end of participation'' in the Pre-foreclosure Sale
procedure, so mortgagees can calculate the appropriate timeframe within which they must initiate foreclosure or
accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure where no actual pre-foreclosure sale has resulted. 


Other Changes 


A conforming amendment is also being made to  200.155(a). That section provides for the various methods by which
a mortgagee may perfect a claim for the payment of mortgage insurance benefits. The case of a pre-foreclosure sale
is being added to this list. 
Section 203.501 is being added to set forth the Department's policy that mortgagees must consider the financial consequences
of their elective servicing action and that HUD expects mortgagees to take those appropriate actions which will generate
the smallest financial loss to the Department. 



Other Matters



Justification for Interim Rule and for the 45-day Comment Period



The Department has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to have notice and public
procedure before making the provisions of this interim rule effective, and that expeditious promulgation of this
interim rule provides a benefit to all the parties involved. 
A successfully completed pre-foreclosure sale benefits the mortgagor, who avoids the stigma of foreclosure on his
or her credit record, and also benefits HUD, which can expect to save by not paying foreclosure-related costs. HUD
also saves on maintenance costs and marketing expenses for properties which would otherwise be conveyed to the Department
following foreclosure. Mortgagees also benefit through incorporating this loss-mitigation technique into their
overall loan servicing, by earning an additional administrative fee and by frequently being able to file claims for
insurance benefits sooner, following a successful pre-foreclosure sale, than they would following a post-foreclosure
conveyance claim. 
Because the requirements and procedures contained in this interim rule are based on the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration
Program established by a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 29, 1991, at 56 FR 24324, and because this interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received
on that notice, the Department believes there is adequate justification for shortening the public comment period
to 45 days. 


Sunset Provision



The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published
before that date. Therefore, this interim rule will expire on a date 18 months from the date of publication. 



Environmental Finding



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276,
451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. 


Information Collection Requirements


The collection of information requirements contained in this interim rule have been submitted to OMB for review under
section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The public reporting burden for the collection of information
requirements contained in this interim rule is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information. Information on these requirements is provided as follows:

Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities because this interim rule pertains to a limited number of single-family
mortgage situations. It expands the options available to financially distressed mortgagors and does not adversely
affect any mortgagor rights or interests under existing FHA-insured loan servicing regulations. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism, 

has determined that this interim rule does not have ``federalism implications'' because it does not have substantial
direct effects on the States (including their political subdivisions), or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. The purpose of this interim rule is to implement the requirements and methods
of pre-foreclosure sales as a means of assisting qualified mortgagors in avoiding foreclosure of their FHA-insured
mortgages and of saving the Department money. 


Executive Order 12606, the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

the Family, 

has determined that this interim rule does not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being. 


Semiannual Agenda


This interim rule was listed as item 1587 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20440), pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
