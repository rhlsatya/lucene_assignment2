DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE


Office of the Secretary

Provincial Interagency Executive Committees (PIEC) Advisory Committees


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to establish a Federal Advisory Committee.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the need of the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of the Interior
for advice on coordination and implementation of the Record of Decision of April 13, 1994 for management of habitat
for late-successional and old-growth forest related species within the range of the Northern Spotted Owl, the Departments
have agreed to establish twelve advisory committees. The purpose of the Advisory Committees is to provide advice
on coordinating the implementation of the Record of Decision. The Advisory Committees will provide advice and recommendations
to promote better integration of forest management activities among Federal and non-Federal entities to ensure
that such activities are complementary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), notice is hereby given that the United States Department
of Agriculture in consultation with the Department of the Interior intends to establish twelve Advisory Committees
to the Provincial Interagency Executive Committees (PIECs) The purpose of the PIECs is to facilitate the coordinated
implementation of the Record of Decision (ROD) of April 13, 1994. The PIECs consist of representatives of some or all
of the following Federal Agencies; the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Environmental Protection Agency.
The purpose of the PIEC Advisory Committees is to advise the PIECs on coordinating the implementation of the ROD. Each
PIEC Advisory Committee also will provide advice regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management
strategy for Federal land within a province (provinces are defined in the ROD at E-19). The PIEC Advisory Committees
will provide advice and recommendations to promote better integration of forest management activities among Federal
and non-Federal entities to ensure that such activities are complementary.


The PIEC Advisory Committees are necessary and in the public interest in connection with the duties and responsibilities
of the United States Department of Agriculture and of the United States Department of the Interior. The ROD provides
direction to the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for developing an ecosystem management approach
that is consistent with statutory authority for land use planning. Ecosystem management at the province level requires
improved coordination among governmental entities responsible for land management decisions and the public they
serve.
The Chairperson of each PIEC Advisory Committee will alternate annually between the Forest Service representative
and the Bureau of Land Management representative in provinces where both agencies administer land. When the Bureau
of Land Management is not represented on the PIEC, the Forest Service representative will serve as Chairperson. The
Chairperson will serve as the Executive Secretary and as the designated Federal official under sections 10 (e) and
(f) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. APP.).
Appointments to the PIEC Advisory Committees will be made by the Regional Forester, Pacific Northwest Region after
consultation with the State Director, Bureau of Land Management, Oregon State Office, when appropriate (in provinces
where the Bureau of Land Management administers land), and the Regional Interagency Executive Committee. The Regional
Forester, Pacific Northwest Region, also shall consult with the Regional Forester, Pacific Southwest Region, when
appropriate. The Bureau of Land Management State Director, Oregon State Office, shall consult with the Bureau of
Land Management State Director, California State Office, when appropriate.
The action of establishing the Advisory Committees does not require amendment of Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
and Forest Service planning documents because these explanatory statements that appear in the ROD (Attachment A,
E-17) are not standards and guidelines or land allocations, which would require an amendment process to change.
The BLM and Forest Service will provide further notices, as needed, for additional actions or adjustments when implementing
interagency coordination, public involvement, and other aspects of the ROD.
Equal opportunity practices will be followed in all appointments to the Advisory Committee. To ensure that the recommendations
of the Advisory Committee have taken into account the needs of the diverse groups served by the Departments, membership
should include individuals with demonstrated ability to represent minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to establish a Federal Advisory Committee.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the need of the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior for advice on coordination and implementation
of the Record of Decision of April 13, 1994 for management of habitat for late-successional and old-growth forest
related species within the range of the Northern Spotted Owl, the Secretaries have agreed to establish an advisory
committee. The Intergovernmental Advisory Committee will provide advice and recommendations to the Regional Interagency
Executive Committee to facilitate better integration of forest management activities among Federal and non-Federal
governmental entities to ensure that such activities are complementary.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), notice is hereby given that the Secretary of Agriculture
after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior intends to establish the Intergovernmental Advisory Committee
(Advisory Committee) to the Regional Interagency Executive Committee (RIEC). The purpose of the RIEC, consisting
of the Pacific Northwest Federal agency heads of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife
Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and Environmental
Protection Agency, is to facilitate the coordinated implementation of the Record of Decision (ROD) of April 13, 1994.
The Advisory Committee to the RIEC will provide advice and recommendations to provide better integration of forest
management activities among Federal and non-Federal governmental entities, to ensure that such activities are
complementary. The Advisory Committee will also promote an exchange of views on ecosystem management among the land
management agencies of the Federal, State, local, and tribal governments in the range of the northern spotted owl.



The Secretaries have determined that the work of the Advisory Committee is necessary and in the public interest and
relevant to the duties of the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior. The duties of the Advisory
Committee will be to provide advice and recommendations to the RIEC regarding the coordinated implementation of
the ROD. No other advisory committee or agency of the Department of Agriculture or Department of the Interior can perform
the tasks that will be assigned to the Advisory Committee.

The Chairperson of the Advisory Committee will alternate between the Regional Forester of the Pacific Northwest
Region, Forest Service and the Oregon State Director, Bureau of Land Management. The Executive Director of the Regional
Ecosystem Office will serve as the Executive Secretary and as the designated Federal official under sections 10 (e)
and (f) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.). 

Appointments to the Advisory Committee will be made by the Secretary of Agriculture after consultation with the Secretary
of the Interior.

The action of establishing the Advisory Committee does not require amendment of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and
Forest Service planning documents because the statements referring to interagency coordination in the ROD (Attachment
A, E-15 to E-17) are not standards and guidelines or land allocations, which would require an amendment
process to change. The BLM and Forest Service will provide further notices, as needed, for any additional actions
or adjustments when implementing interagency coordination, public involvement, and other aspects of the ROD.

Equal opportunity practices will be followed in all appointments to the Advisory Committee. To ensure that the recommendations
of the Advisory Committee have taken into account the needs of the diverse groups served by the Departments, membership
should include individuals with demonstrated ability to represent minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 17, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Argentina (59 FR 25611). We have now completed
this review and determine the total net subsidy to be zero for all companies for the period January 1, 1991 through December
31, 1991. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On May 17, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25611) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on leather wearing
apparel from Argentina (48 FR 11480; March 18, 1983). We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary
results. We received no comments. Therefore, there have been no changes in the analysis of programs between the preliminary
results and these final results. We have now completed this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act
of 1930, as amended (the Act). 


Scope of Review 


Imports covered by this review are shipments of Argentine leather coats, jackets and other apparel including leather
vests, pants and shorts for men, boys, women, girls and infants. Also included are outer shells and parts and pieces
of leather wearing apparel. This merchandise is classifiable under item number 4203.10.40 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule 

(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

The review period is January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. This review involves one company, Comercio Internacional
S.A.C.I.F.I.A. (Comercio), which accounts for virtually all exports to the United States, and nine government programs.



Final Results of Review 


As a result of our review, we determine the total net subsidy to be zero during the period January 1, 1991 through December
31, 1991. 
Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service not to assess countervailing duties on shipments of
the subject merchandise from all companies, exported on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before December 31, 1991.
Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will instruct Customs that the cash deposit rate
on shipments of this merchandise from all companies, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after
the date of publication of this notice is zero. This deposit instruction shall remain in effect until publication
of the final results of the next administrative review. 
This administrative review and notice are being published in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C.
1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22(c)(8).

SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and a service to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing
persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 22, June 24 and July 22, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published
notices (59 FR 19164, 32688 and 37465) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and service.


3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and service to the Government.


4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement
List. 

Accordingly, the following commodities and service are hereby added to the Procurement List:

<AGENCY>

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the Procurement List.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are
blind or have other severe disabilities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 5, 1994, the committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59
FR 40010) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 



Comments were received from the current contractor for this service, which noted that most of the Government grounds
maintenance contracts in its area have recently been combined into a small number of large contracts which small grounds
maintenance companies are unable to perform. Consequently, the contractor claims its business has been reduced
substantially, to the point 
where loss of the opportunity to provide the grounds maintenance service which is the subject of this Committee action
may force the contractor out of business.

This grounds maintenance service constitutes a very small percentage of the contractor total sales. More importantly,
the service is a new requirement, and the contractor was given a short-term interim contract to perform it while the
Committee processed the service for addition to the Procurement List. Under these circumstances, the contractor
could not have become so dependent on the contract that losing it would threaten its continued viability. 

Government grounds maintenance services generally, and this one in particular, are not appreciably different from
similar services performed for non-Government customers. The contractor has given the Committee no indications
why it cannot seek additional opportunities in the commercial grounds maintenance market to replace the ones it believes
it will lose because of the consolidation of Government grounds maintenance contracts in its area. As a result, the
Committee does not believe the consolidation of Government contracts substantially increases the impact on the
contractor of adding this service requirement to the Procurement List. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the service, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee
has determined that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C.
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the service to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the service. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the service to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the Procurement List:




Grounds Maintenance 

Admiral Bakerfield U.S. Army Reserve Center 

San Diego, California




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised
under those contracts.

Section 602(a) of the Department of Energy (``DOE'') Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91, hereinafter referred
to as the ``Act'') prohibits a ``supervisory employee'' (defined in section 601(a) of the Act) of the Department from
knowingly receiving compensation from, holding any official relation with, or having any pecuniary interest in
any ``energy concern'' (defined in section 601(b) of the Act).
Section 602(c) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Energy to waive the requirements of section 602(a) in cases where
the interest is a pension, insurance, or other similarly vested interest.
Mr. John Tyler Carslon has been appointed as Area Manager in the Phoenix Area Office of the Western Area Power Administration.
As a result of his previous employment with Public Service Company of Colorado, Mr. Carlson has a vested pension interest,
within the meaning of section 602(c) of the Act, in the Employees' Retirement Plan of Public Service Company of Colorado
and Participating Subsidiaries. I have granted Mr. Carlson a waiver of the divestiture requirement of section 602(a)
of the Act with respect to this vested pension interest for the duration of his employment with the Department as a supervisory
employee.

<DOCTITLE>Trunkline Gas Co., Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



September 26, 1994.



Take notice that on September 21, 1994, Trunkline Gas Company (Truckline), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251-1642,
filed a request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-789-000 pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon by sale two 4-inch diameter liquid transmission laterals
 located in Vermilion Block 26, offshore Louisiana, to Union Oil Company of California (UNOCAL), all as more fully
set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection.






Truckline proposes to sell its Laterals 210B-1700 (approximately 1,390 feet long) and 210B-1800 (approximately
1,540 feet long) in Vermilion Block 26 To UNOCAL. Following abandonment Truckline would permanently disconnect
Lateral 210B-1700 (which runs between UNOCAL's Vermilion Block 26 B platform and Trunkline's Vermilion Block
T-2 platform) and Lateral 210B-1800 (which runs between UNOCAL`s Vermilion Block 26 C platform and Trunkline's
Vermilion Block T-2 platform) from its system and connect the two laterals on the T-2 platform. Trunkline
states that UNOCAL intends to use the laterals to move low pressure natural gas in conjunction with its production
operations. Trunkline proposes to sell the laterals to UNOCAL for $25,000 and would not incur any expenses in connecting
the laterals on the T-2 platform. Trunkline also states that it has not used these laterals since 1974.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October
17, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in
determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,
a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion
to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission
and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave
to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further
notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Trunkline to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

The Committee was first established in 1992 to advise the federal government on policies to improve the process by
which federal facility environmental restoration decisions are made, such that these decisions reflect the priorities
and concerns of all stakeholders. In renewing the Committee's charter, the Administrator has established the objective
of refining and further developing issues related to environmental restoration activities at federal facilities.

The Committee will consist of 40-50 members to be appointed by the Administrator to assure a balanced representation
among all stakeholders involved with federal facilities environmental restoration.

The Committee will function solely as an advisory body, and in compliance with provisions of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act. Copies of the Committee's revised charter will be filed with appropriate committees of the Congress
and with the Library of Congress.

Inquiries or comments may be directed to Ms. Marilyn Null, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460 or telephone: 202/260-5686.

<DOCTITLE>Clean Water Act; Contractor Access to Confidential Business Information </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intended transfer of confidential business information to contractors.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to transfer to EPA contractors and subcontractors, technical
and financial confidential business information (CBI) collected from several metals forming, finishing, and fabricating
industries including the metal products and machinery manufacturing, maintenance and rebuilding industry. Transfer
of the information will allow the contractors and subcontractors to assist EPA in developing effluent limitations
guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for the metal products and machinery industry. The information
being transferred was collected under the authority of section 308 of the Clean Water Act. Interested persons may
submit comments on this intended transfer of information to the address noted below.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA has previously transferred to its contractor Radian Corporation of Herndon, Virginia (and subcontractors)
information, including confidential business information (CBI), concerning the metal products and machinery
industry collected under the authority of the Clean Water Act section 308. 


The information transferred included: Questionnaire data collected during a two phase survey of the metal products
industry; the first phase consisted of the screener questionnaire or the ``mini-data collection portfolio (mdcp)
which was conducted in 1990 (OMB No. 2040-0148); the second phase was a more detailed questionnaire or data collection
portfolio (dcp) that was sent in 1991 to a randomly selected sample identified through the responses to the mdcp (OMB
No. 2040-0148). EPA also transferred site visit and field sampling data collected during 1990 through 1993.
In addition, Radian has received similar records and data developed in support of the following effluent guidelines
regulations:
 Porcelain Enameling (data collection 1977 through 1979), 
 Coil Coating (data collection 1977 through 1979), 
 Aluminum Forming (data collection 1978 through 1981), 
 Battery Manufacturing (data collection 1978 through 1983), 
 Copper Forming (data collection 1978 through 1979), 
 Electroplating (data collection 1974 through 1979), 
 Metal Finishing (data collection 1974 through 1979), 
 Metal Molding and Casting (data collection 1977 through 1983), 
 Nonferrous Metals Forming and Metal Powders (data collection 1983 through 1985), 
 Nonferrous Metals Manufacturing, Phases I and II (data collection 1978 through 1985), 
 Plastics Molding and Forming (data collection 1980 through 1987), and 
 Hot Dip Coating Subcategory of the Iron and Steel regulation (data collection 1986). 
Radian has also received files gathered during studies of the beryllium copper forming industry (data collection
during 1986), the platemaking industry (data collection during 1984), and the printing and publishing industry
(data collection 1977 through 1979). EPA determined that this transfer was necessary to enable the contractor and
subcontractors to perform their work under EPA Contract No. 68-C0-0005 and related subcontracts by assisting
EPA in developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the metal products and machinery industry.
Notice to this effect was provided to the affected companies at the time the data was collected or through 

Federal Register

 notice. 
Today, EPA is giving notice that it has entered into a new contract No. 68-C4-0024 with Radian Corporation
of Herndon, VA and Radian Corp. has entered into additional contracts with its subcontractors: Westat, Inc. of Rockville,
MD; Amendola Engineering, Inc. of Lakewood, OH; CAI Engineering of Oakton, VA; Information Systems Solutions International,
Inc. of Vienna, VA and Marasco Newton Group, Inc. of Arlington, VA. to develop effluent limitations guidelines and
standards for the metal products and machinery phase I industry. The effective date of the new contract is October
1, 1994. Radian Corp. will provide technical support such as completion of the public docket for the proposed rulemaking
and completion of the work on the draft proposed technical development document. The contractor shall also provide
support on post proposal efforts, including assisting with public meetings, responding to comments, filling data
gaps that arise through comments on the proposed rule, and assisting with the assembly of the rulemaking record for
the final rule. 
The subcontractors will assist the prime by providing specific expertise. Westat, Inc. will assist with any surveys
that may be required in future work, data management and statistical analysis. Amendola Engineering, Inc. will provide
assistance in pollution prevention and water pollution control. CAI Engineering provides metal products industrial
wastewater and hazardous waste engineering expertise, surface treatment process design and pollution prevention
expertise and wastewater treatment system design expertise. Information Systems Solutions International, Inc.
offers information and data management services and Marasco Newton Group, Inc. provides information management
services. 
In accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, the previously collected information described above (including confidential
business information) will be transferred to Radian Corp. EPA has determined that this transfer is necessary to enable
the contractor to perform their work under EPA Contract No. 68-C4-0024. 
The metal products and machinery manufacturing, rebuilding and maintenance industry financial and economic data
that were collected through the dcp survey in 1991 (OMB No. 2040-0148) was transferred to Abt Associates under
Contract No. 68-C0-0080, which will expire September 30, 1994. In accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart
B, the previously collected information described above (including confidential business information) will be
transferred to ERG, Contract No. 68-C3-0302. ERG has subcontracted with Abt Associates to conduct the
economic analysis for the metal products and machinery industry. EPA has determined that this transfer is necessary
to enable the contractor to perform their work under EPA contract No. 68-C3-0302. 
Anyone wishing to comment on the above matters must submit comments to the address given above by October 11, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Receipt of Requests to Voluntarily Cancel Certain Pesticide Registrations </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended,
EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel certain pesticide registrations.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, provides that a
pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. The Act further
provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request. 



II. Intent to Cancel 



This notice announces receipt by the Agency of requests to cancel some 40 pesticide products registered under section
3 or 24(c) of FIFRA. These registrations are listed in sequence by registration number (or company number and 24(c)
number) in the following Table 1. 







 



Unless a request is withdrawn by the registrant within 90 days of publication of this notice, orders will be issued
cancelling all of these registrations. Users of these pesticides or anyone else desiring the retention of a registration
should contact the applicable registrant directly during this 90-day period. The following Table 2 includes
the names and addresses of record for all registrants of the products in Table 1, in sequence by EPA Company Number.










III. Loss of Active Ingredients 



Unless the request for cancellation is withdrawn, one pesticide active ingredient will no longer appear in any registered
products. Those who are concerned about the potential loss of this active ingredient for pesticidal use are encouraged
to work directly with the registrant to explore the possibility of their withdrawing the request for cancellation.
This active ingredient is listed in the following Table 3, with the EPA Company Number.




 



IV. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 



Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before December 29, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1 year after the date the
cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as prescribed
in 

Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide
products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment
prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing
stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided
that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions
to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use
of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has
identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Receipt of Requests to Voluntarily Cancel Certain Pesticide Registrations </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended,
EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel certain pesticide registrations.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Introduction 



Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, provides that a
pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. The Act further
provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request. 



II. Intent to Cancel 



This notice announces receipt by the Agency of requests to cancel some 39 pesticide products registered under section
3 or 24(c) of FIFRA. These registrations are listed in sequence by registration number (or company number and 24(c)
number) in the following Table 1. 






 
 




Unless a request is withdrawn by the registrant within 90 days of publication of this notice, orders will be issued
cancelling all of these registrations. Users of these pesticides or anyone else desiring the retention of a registration
should contact the applicable registrant directly during this 90-day period. 

The following Table 2 includes the names and addresses of record for all registrants of the products in Table 1, in sequence
by EPA Company Number.











III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 



Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before December 29, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1-year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. 

Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which
have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless
the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed,
sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved
label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when
more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been
imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated
with a particular chemical.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Opportunity to Initiate Negotiations for </DOCTITLE>
 TSCA Section 4 Enforceable Consent Agreements; 
 Solicitation of Testing Proposals for ATSDR Chemicals 


 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice invites manufacturers and processors of 
certain chemical substances who wish to participate in testing 
negotiations for various chemicals to develop and submit testing 
program proposals to EPA. The chemicals are hazardous substances 
identified for data needs by the Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry (ATSDR), National Toxicological Program (NTP) 
and EPA pursuant to section 104(i)(5) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 
(CERCLA or Superfund)(42 U.S.C. 9601-9675). These 12 chemical 
substances are vinyl chloride, benzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, hydrogen cyanide, sodium cyanide,
toluene, methylene chloride, chloroethane, mercury, chromium, and beryllium. These substances and associated
data needs appear in Table 1 below. The specific forms of the metals mercury, chromium, and beryllium to be tested are
yet to be determined; EPA will solicit testing proposals for the specific forms of these metals at a later date. Testing
proposals should cover all identified data needs of a substance (or multiple substances) in order to be considered
for Enforceable Consent Agreement (ECA) negotiation. If, after receiving testing proposals, EPA elects to pursue
negotiations for one or more ECAs applicable to specific chemicals, EPA will solicit requests to be designated an
interested party at that point. EPA has authority to require testing for these 12 chemical substances under section
4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15 U.S.C. 2601-2692) and if an ECA-based approach does not prove
viable, EPA would proceed with rulemaking to require the needed testing.
 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background 
 


 A. Solicitation for Testing Proposals 



 EPA's procedures for requiring the testing of chemical substances under section 4 of TSCA include the adoption of
ECAs and the promulgation of test rules. On numerous occasions, chemical companies have approached EPA to negotiate
ECAs for testing chemicals which are likely to become the subject of proposed test rules. EPA will follow the procedures
outlined in unit II of this notice to develop ECAs.
 
 

B. Chemical Data Needs 


 The data needs which are the subject of this notice were determined in accordance with the requirements of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 which amended and extended CERCLA. 
 Section 104(i) of CERCLA requires ATSDR and EPA to prepare 
and revise a list of hazardous substances which are most commonly 
found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL) 
and which ATSDR and EPA, in their sole discretion, determine are 
posing the most significant potential threat to human health. 
The lists of these 275 hazardous substances were published in the 


Federal Register

 on April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866); October 20, 
1988 (53 FR 41280); October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43615); October 17, 
1990 (55 FR 42067); October 17, 1991 (55 FR 52166); October 28, 
1992 (57 FR 48801); and October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53739). 
 Section 104(i) of CERCLA also directs ATSDR to prepare 
toxicological profiles of each listed hazardous substance. 
Section 104(i)(3) outlines the content of these profiles. Each 
profile is required to include an examination, summary and 
interpretation of available toxicological information and 
epidemiologic evaluations in order to ascertain the levels of 
significant human exposure for the substance and the associated 
health effects. The profiles must also include a determination 
of whether adequate information on the health effects of each 
substance is available or in the process of development. ATSDR 
has prepared 110 toxicological profiles covering 195 substances. 
(One toxicological profile may cover several related substances). 
 Under CERCLA, section 104(i)(5), when adequate information 
is not available on the health effects of each substance, ATSDR, 
in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is 
required to assure the initiation of a research program designed 
to determine such health effects (and techniques for developing 
methods to determine such health effects). 
As the first step in developing its health effects research 
program, ATSDR identified data needs for each substance in the 
toxicological profiles. These data needs were reviewed by 
scientists from ATSDR, NTP, EPA and the Centers for Disease 
Control, peer reviewed by an external review panel, and made 
available for public comment. Prior to final publication of the 
toxicological profiles, ATSDR considered all public comments it 
received regarding identification of data needs for the 
substances. 
 The next step in the development of the health effects 
research program (or the substance-specific research program) 
involved the creation of the ``Decision Guide for Identifying 
Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxicological Profiles'' 
(Decision Guide), published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 
11, 1989 (54 FR 37618). Applying the principles discussed in the 
Decision Guide, ATSDR published the ``Identification of Priority 
Data Needs for 38 Priority Hazardous Substances'' in the 

Federal Register

 on October 17, 1991 (56 FR 52178). As required by CERCLA, section 104(i)(5), ATSDR considered recommendations from
the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), and, with EPA, coordinated development of these priority data needs with
NTP and with programs of toxicological testing established under TSCA and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)(7 
U.S.C. 136). The purpose of such coordination is to avoid 
duplication of effort and to assure that the listed hazardous 
substances are tested thoroughly at the earliest practicable 
date. ATSDR also considered public comments on identification of 
the priority data needs. On November 16, 1992, ATSDR published 
the ``Announcement of Final Priority Data Needs for 38 Priority 
Hazardous Substances'' in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 54150). 
Copies of the FR actions cited above are available in the docket 
established for this action (OPPTS-42052P; FRL-4756-5). 

CERCLA, section 104(i)(5)(C) provides that TSCA authorities 
may be used to carry out the health effects research program. CERCLA, 
section 104(i)(5)(D) declares that: 


 
 

[i]t is the sense of the Congress that the costs of [conducting health effects research programs] be borne by the manufacturers
and processors of the 
hazardous substances in question, as required in programs of toxicological testing under the Toxic Substances Control
Act. 



 
 

 In October 1992, ATSDR requested that EPA test 38 substances 
using authorities under TSCA and FIFRA. EPA coordinated extensively with other Federal agencies (including the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Mine Safety
and Health Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission) and among its own programs (including Office
of Air and Radiation, Office of Water, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, and Office of Research and Development)
to evaluate ATSDR's request for testing. In addition, EPA, ATSDR, and the National Institute of Environmental Health

Sciences (NIEHS) met as members of the Tri-Agency Superfund Applied Research Committee (TASARC) to discuss ATSDR's
data needs and EPA's response. Copies of the minutes of the TASARC meetings are available in the docket established
for this action. 
 

In response to ATSDR's initial request to test 38 substances, EPA deleted substances from the initial list and deleted
and added associated data needs based on various factors including, but not limited to, the appropriateness of using
TSCA authority to require testing of certain substances and the needs of other Federal Agencies and EPA programs for
certain test data. Relevant correspondence between EPA and ATSDR regarding these selections is available in the
docket established for this action. In a letter dated November 9, 1993, EPA informed ATSDR that EPA would pursue testing
of ATSDR substances under section 4 of TSCA. The ATSDR list of 38 substances was modified to contain the 12 substances
shown in Table 1 below with a summary description of data needs. These substances will be added to the next edition of
the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics' Master Testing List scheduled for release in FY '95. Further description
of the data needs are available in the docket established for this action.

Note that TASARC has set up a workgroup to identify the specific forms of the metals mercury, chromium and beryllium
to be tested. This workgroup will consider the needs of other Federal Agencies and EPA programs. In addition, EPA will
solicit testing proposals for the specific forms of these metals at a later date. Note also that EPA has not yet developed
testing guidelines for certain endpoints indicated in Table 1 below. EPA particularly encourages submission of
testing guidelines for these endpoints which may be used as part 
of a testing proposal. 

EPA realizes that under certain circumstances, as outlined below, route-to-route extrapolation based on valid
pharmacokinetic (PK) data can offer a useful and less expensive alternative to retesting by another route of exposure
to chemical substances that have already been tested by one route. Therefore, EPA will consider entering into ECAs
for PK testing under protocols proposed by prospective test sponsors.

EPA will consider route-to-route extrapolation of toxicity data from routes other than those proposed in Table 1
below when it is scientifically reasonable to empirically derive the risk. Derivation of the risk is only reasonable
when portal-of-entry effects and first-pass effects 
can be ruled out or adequately characterized. Regardless of the toxic endpoint considered, EPA's ability to perform
quantitative route-to-route extrapolation is critically dependent on the amount and type of data available. The
minimum information needed includes both the nature of the toxic effects and a description of the relationship between
exposure and the toxic effect.

The preferred method for performing route-to-route extrapolation involves the development of a physiologically-based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that describes the disposition (deposition, absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and elimination) of the chemical for the routes of interest. PBPK models must be used in conjunction with toxicity
and mechanistic studies in order to relate the effective dose associated with an effect for the test species and conditions
to other scenerios.

 The primary purpose of this ASTDR/EPA health effects testing program 
is to meet the substance-specific information needs of the 
public and the scientific community, and, consistent with the guidelines discussed in the Decision Guide, this testing
program will supply toxicity and exposure information which will assist in the development of Superfund health assessments
by ASTDR. In addition, because of the involvement by other Federal Agencies and EPA offices in reviewing the testing
needs identified for these chemicals, this testing program will supply test data which will also meet the needs of
other Federal Agencies and EPA programs. 







Notes:






*Note that a soon-to-be-published proposed test rule on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) will cover chloroethane.

**A workgroup set up by TASARC is in the process of 
 identifying the specific forms of these metals. 
 
 TBD -- The Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number(s) for the chemical(s) to be tested is yet to be determined. 

R -- Proposed revised EPA guidelines for reproductive toxicity 
 testing are under development and are anticipated to be 
 finalized in the near future. Copies of the latest 
 draft to date are available in the docket established 
 for this action. 
D -- Proposed revised EPA guidelines for developmental toxicity 
 testing are under development and are anticipated to be 
 finalized in the near future. Copies of the latest draft to date
 are available in the docket established for this action. 

N -- EPA intends for parties subject to neurotoxicity 
 testing requirements under this rule to follow the 1991 
 Neurotoxicology Testing Guidelines which are available 
 in the docket established for this action. 

I -- A workgroup established by the Tri-Agency Superfund 
 Applied Research Committee (TASARC) is developing 
 immunotoxicity testing guidelines. 
 
 A -- Revised EPA guidelines for acute inhalation testing are under development and will soon be published with a proposed
test rule on HAPs. Copies of the latest draft to date are available in the docket established for this action.

 PK -- EPA has developed testing guidelines which may be used for 
 conducting comparative pharmokinetic testing. These 
 final guidelines are awaiting publication and are 
 available in the docket established for this action. 
 


II. Procedures for Development of ECAs
 
 

 EPA will follow the procedures outlined below to develop 
 ECAs for the chemical substances listed in Table 1 above. 
 
  1.

 Submission of testing proposals for ECA 
negotiations.

 Following publication of this Notice, 
manufacturers and processors have 60 days to develop testing 
proposals for the chemical substances listed in Table 1 above that they 
wish EPA to consider as candidates for ECA negotiations. EPA may extend the deadline for receipt of testing proposals
upon a showing of good faith efforts to develop testing proposals by the initial deadline. The testing proposals should
describe the testing to be performed in detail (test guideline or 
protocol, including route of administration, species, etc.) and 
explain in detail where there are deviations from tests proposed 
by EPA in Table 1 above. The Agency suggests as a model the testing 
proposal submitted on 

N-

methylpyrrolidone (NMP) by the NMP 
Producers Group on September 11, 1992 found in the docket 
established for this action. In order for a testing proposal to 
be eligible for consideration, the proposal should cover all 
identified data needs of a substance (or multiple substances). 
  2.

 Agency selection of most likely candidates for the 
ECA program. 

 EPA will review the submissions and select the most 
promising submissions as candidates for negotiation. Submissions 
which fully address EPA's concerns will have a higher chance of 
success than those which do not fully address all data needs 
issues. 
 3.

 Formal solicitation of ``interested parties'' in the

 


Federal Register

. If EPA selects a proposal as a candidate for 
negotiations, such negotiations will be conducted pursuant to 
procedures described in 40 CFR 790.28. Accordingly, EPA will 
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 soliciting persons 
interested in participating in or monitoring negotiations for the 
development of an ECA, to so notify the Agency in 
writing. Those individuals and groups who respond to EPA's 
notice by the deadline established in the notice will have the 
status of ``interested parties'' and will be afforded opportunities 
to participate in the negotiation process. Designation as an 
``interested party'' will not incur any obligations. Submitters of 
testing proposals will be considered interested parties with 
regard to the subject(s) of their proposals and need not respond 
to the solicitation notice. 
 4.

 Negotiation of testing program and development of an 
ECA.

 Negotiations will be conducted in meetings open to the public. Notification of meetings will be given only to persons
identified as interested parties. The first negotiation meeting will establish the period for negotiation. If agreement
is not reached within this prescribed 
time limit and EPA chooses not to extend the negotiation period, 
negotiations will be terminated and testing will be required 
under a rule. 
 5.

 Approval of the ECA by interested parties and EPA and publication of a notice in the

 

Federal Register.

 After EPA and interested parties have agreed in principle on the terms of the ECA, the ECA text will be sent for approval
to interested parties who are actual participants in the negotiation. Subsequent to approval of the ECA, EPA will
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 summarizing the testing program and announcing that in lieu of a test rule, the Agency has issued a testing Consent
Order that incorporates the ECA. 
 


III. Public Record 
 


 EPA has established a record for this action (docket control 
number OPPTS-42052P; FRL-4756-5). The record includes basic 
information considered by EPA in developing this action. EPA 
will supplement the record with additional information as it is 
received. 
 A public version of this record is available in the TSCA 
Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The NCIC is 
located in Rm. NE-B607, Mail Code 7407, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, 20460. Written requests for copies of
documents contained in this record may be sent to the above address or faxed to (202) 260-9555.

 47 CFR Part 90, Subparts B-F) except in the 220 MHz band (

see

 47 CFR Part 90, Subpart T), including those based on finder's preferences (

see

 47 CFR Section 90.173); and

(12) Private Operational Fixed Services (

see

 47 CFR Part 94).



Section 1.2103 Competitive Bidding Design Options



(a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or
classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The choice of competitive bidding design will generally be made
pursuant to the criteria set forth in the Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93-253, FCC 94-61, 59 FR
22980 (May 4, 1994), adopted March 8, 1994, but the Commission may design and test alternative methodologies. The
Commission will choose from one or more of the following types of auction designs for services or classes of services
subject to competitive bidding:




(1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous)
(2) Sequential oral auctions

<TEXT>
 

(3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions



(b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction.
(c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction.


Section 1.2104 Competitive Bidding Mechanisms


(a) 

Sequencing. 

The Commission will establish the sequence in which multiple licenses will be auctioned.
(b) 

Grouping. 

In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial
bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination.
(c) 

Reservation Price. 

The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject
to auction will not be awarded.
(d) 

Minimum Bid Increments. 

The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage
terms. The Commission may also establish suggested minimum opening bids on a service-specific basis.
(e) 

Stopping Rules. 

The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the auctions
within a reasonable time.
(f) 

Activity Rules. 

The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity.
(g) 

Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Penalties. 

As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to  1.2103,
the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default
on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.
(1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be
subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the
license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds
the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing
bidder has deposited with the Commission.
(2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close
of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in subsection (1) plus an additional penalty
equal to 3 percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid
amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be
deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with
the Commission.
When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify
the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such
penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
(h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction
but may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated with bidder identification
numbers.
(i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle,
evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that
affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole
discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or
cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.


Section 1.2105 Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion


(a) 

Submission of Short Form Application (FCC Form 175). 

In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with
any appropriate filing fee set forth by Public Notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need
not be accompanied by an upfront payment (

see 

Section 1.2106 of this part).
(1) All Form 175s will be due:
(i) On the date(s) specified by Public Notice; or
(ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law (

see, e.g., 

47 CFR Section 22.902), on a date specified by Public Notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that
have been filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists.

<PARENT> FR940930-2-00030 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The Form 175 must contain the following information:

(i) Identification of each license on which the applicant wishes to bid;

(ii) The applicant's name, if the applicant is an individual. If the applicant is a corporation, then the short-form
application will require the name and address of the corporate office and the name and title of an officer or director.
If the applicant is a partnership, then the application will require the name, citizenship and address of all partners,
and, if a partner is not a natural person, then the name and title of a responsible person should be included as well.
If the applicant is a trust, then the name and address of the trustee will be required. If the applicant is none of the
above, then it must identify and describe itself and its principals or other responsible persons;

(iii) The identity of the person(s) authorized to make or withdraw a bid;

(iv) If the applicant applies as a designated entity pursuant to  1.2110 of these rules, a statement to that effect
and a declaration, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is qualified as a designated entity under  1.2110
of the Commission's Rules;

(v) Certification that the applicant is legally, technically, financially and otherwise qualified pursuant to
Section 308(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The Commission will accept applications certifying
that a request for waiver or other relief from the requirements of Section 310 is pending;

(vi) Certification that the applicant is in compliance with the foreign ownership provisions of Section 310 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended;

(vii) Certification that the applicant is and will, during the pendency of its application(s), remain in compliance
with any service-specific qualifications applicable to the licenses on which the applicant intends to bid including,
but not limited to, financial qualifications. The Commission may require certification in certain services that
the applicant will, following grant of a license, come into compliance with certain service-specific rules, including,
but not limited to, ownership eligibility limitations;

(viii) An exhibit, certified as truthful under penalty of perjury, identifying all parties with whom the applicant
has entered into partnerships, joint ventures, consortia or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
of any kind relating to the licenses being auctioned, including any such agreements relating to the post-auction
market structure.

(ix) Certification under penalty of perjury that it has not entered and will not enter into any explicit or implicit
agreements, arrangements or understandings of any kind with any parties other than those identified pursuant to
subsection (viii) regarding the amount of their bids, bidding strategies or the particular licenses on which they
will or will not bid;






Note:

 The Commission may also request applicants to submit additional information for informational purposes to aid in
its preparation of required reports to Congress.




(b) 

Modification and Dismissal of Form 175.

 (1) Any Form 175 that is not signed or otherwise does not contain all of the certifications required pursuant to this
section is unacceptable for filing and cannot be corrected subsequent to any applicable filing deadline. The application
will be dismissed with prejudice and the upfront payment, if paid, will be returned.

(2) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects specified herein (except for failure
to sign the application and to make certifications) and to resubmit a corrected application. Form 175 may be amended
or modified to make minor changes or correct minor errors in the application (such as typographical errors). The Commission
will classify all amendments as major or minor, pursuant to rules applicable to specific services. An application
will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment and may not be resubmitted after
applicable filing deadlines.

(3) Applicants who fail to correct defects in their applications in a timely manner as specified by Public Notice will
have their applications dismissed with no opportunity for resubmission.



(c) Prohibition of Collusion.

 (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this subsection, after the filing of short-form applications,
all bidders are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating; discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other bidders until
after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such bidders are members of a bidding consortium or other
joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to Section 1.2105(a)(2)(viii).

(2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership
at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant,
and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for the same
license. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application.

<TEXT>
 

(3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided
the parties to the agreement have not applied for the same license.



Section 1.2106 Submission of Upfront Payments



(a) The Commission may require applicants for licenses subject to competitive bidding to submit an upfront payment.
In that event, the amount of the upfront payment and the procedures for submitting it will be set forth in a Public Notice.
No interest will be paid on upfront payments.

(b) Upfront payments must be made either by wire transfer or by cashier's check drawn in U.S. dollars from a financial
institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and must be made payable to the
Federal Communications Commission.

(c) If an upfront payment is not in compliance with the Commission's Rule, or if insufficient funds are tendered to
constitute a valid upfront payment, the applicant shall have a limited opportunity to correct its submission to bring
it up to the minimum valid upfront payment prior to the auction. If the applicant does not submit at least the minimum
upfront payment, it will be ineligible to bid, its application will be dismissed and any upfront payment it has made
will be returned.

(d) The upfront payment(s) of a bidder will be credited toward any down payment required for licenses on which the bidder
is the high bidder. Where the upfront payment amount exceeds the required deposit of a winning bidder, the Commission
may refund the excess amount after determining that no bid withdrawal penalties are owed by that bidder.

(e) In accordance with the provisions of subsection (d), in the event a penalty is assessed pursuant to  1.2104
for bid withdrawal or default, upfront payments or down payments on deposit with the Commission will be used to satisfy
the bid withdrawal or default penalty before being applied toward any additional obligations that the high bidder
may have.



Section 1.2107 Submission of Down Payment and Filing of Long-Form Applications



(a) After bidding has ended, the Commission will identify and notify the high bidder and declare the bidding closed.

Within five (5) business days after being notified that it is a high bidder on a particular license(s), a high bidder
must submit to the Commission's lockbox bank such additional funds (the ``down payment'') as are necessary to bring
its total deposits (not including upfront payments applied to satisfy penalties) up to twenty (20) percent of its
high bid(s). (In single round sealed bid auctions conducted under  1.2103, however, bidders may be required
to submit their down payment with their bids.) This down payment must be made by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
in U.S. dollars from a financial institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
and must be made payable to the Federal Communications Commission. Winning bidders who are qualified designated
entities eligible for installment payments under  1.2110(d) are only required to bring their total deposits
up to ten (10) percent of their winning bid(s). Such designated entities must pay the remainder of the twenty (20) percent
down payment within five (5) business days of grant of their application. 

See

  1.2110(e) (1) and (2) of this subpart. Down payments will be held by the Commission until the high bidder has
been awarded the license and has paid the remaining balance due on the license, in which case it will not be returned,
or until the winning bidder is found unqualified to be a licensee or has defaulted, in which case it will be returned,
less applicable penalties. No interest will be paid on any down payment.

(c) A high bidder that meets its down payment obligations in a timely manner must, within ten (10) business days after
being notified that it is a high bidder, submit an additional application (the ``long-form application'') pursuant
to the rules governing the service in which the applicant is the high bidder (unless it has already submitted such an
application, as contemplated by  1.2105(a)(1)(b). For example, if the applicant is a high bidder for a license
in the Interactive Video Data Service 

See

 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart F), the long form application will be submitted on FCC Form 574 in accordance with Section 95.815
of the Rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, high
bidders need not submit an additional application filing fee with their long-form applications. Notwithstanding
any other provision in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations to the contrary, the high bidder's long-form application
must be mailed or otherwise delivered to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention:
Auction Application Processing Section, 1919 M Street, NW., Room 222, Washington, DC 20554.

An applicant that fails to submit the required long-form application as required under this subsection, and fails
to establish good cause for any late-filed submission, shall be deemed to have defaulted and will be subject to the
penalties set forth in  1.2104 of the Commission's Rules.

(d) As an exhibit to its long-form application, the applicant must provide a detailed explanation of the terms and
conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement or arrangement
it had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the time bidding was completed. Such agreements
must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications pursuant to  1.2105.

Section 1.2108 Procedures for Filing Petitions To Deny Against Long-Form Applications 







(a) Where petitions to deny are otherwise provided for under the Act or the Commission's Rules, and unless other service-specific
procedures for the filing of such petitions are provided for elsewhere in the Commission's Rules, the procedures
in this section shall apply to the filing of petitions to deny the long-form applications of winning bidders.







(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Commission gives public notice that a long-form applications has been accepted
for filing, petitions to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain allegations of fact supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.





(c) An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations
of fact or denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The
times for filing such opposition and replies will be those provided in  1.45 of these Rules.






(d) If the Commission determines that:


(1) An applicant is qualified and there is no substantial and material issue of fact concerning that determination,
it will grant the application.




(2) An applicant is not qualified and that there is no substantial issue of fact concerning that determination, the
Commission need not hold an evidentiary hearing and will deny the application.


(3) Substantial and material issues of fact require a hearing, it will conduct a hearing. The Commission may permit
all or part of the evidence to be submitted in written form and may permit employees other than administrative law judges
to preside at the taking of written evidence. Such hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis.







Section 1.2109 License Grant, Denial, Default, and Disqualification













(a) Unless otherwise specified in these rules, auction winners are required to pay the balance of their winning bids
in a lump sum within five (5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned
on full and timely payment of the winning bid.




(b) If a winning bidder withdraws its bid after the Commission has declared competitive bidding closed or fails to
remit the required down payment within five (5) business days after the Commission has declared competitive bidding
closed, the bidder will be deemed to have defaulted, its application will be dismissed, and it will be liable for the
default penalty specified in  1.12104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission may either re-auction the license
to existing or new applicants or offer it to the other highest bidders (in descending order) at their final bids. The
down payment obligations set forth in  1.2107(b) will apply.






(c) A winning bidder who is found unqualified to be a licensee, fails to remit the balance of its winning bid in a timely
manner, or defaults or is disqualified for any reason after having made the required down payment, will be deemed to
have defaulted and will be liable for the penalty set forth in  1.2104(g)(2). In such event, the Commission will
conduct another auction for the license, affording new parties an opportunity to file applications for the license.


(d) Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in connection with their participation
in the competitive bidding process may be subject, in addition to any other applicable sanctions, to forfeiture of
their upfront payment, down payment of full bid amount, and may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.






Section 1.2110 Designated Entities








(a) Designated entities are small businesses, businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women, and rural
telephone companies.




(b) Definitions. (1) Small businesses. The Commission will establish the definition of a small business on a service-specific
basis, taking into consideration the characteristics and capital requirements of the particular service.





(2) Businesses owned by member of minority groups and/or women. Unless otherwise provided in rules governing specific
services, a business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or women who are
U.S. citizens control the applicant, have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and, in the case of a corporate applicant,
a 50.1 percent voting interest. For applicants that are partnerships, every general partner either must be a minority
and/or woman (or minorities and/or women) who are U.S. citizens and who individually or together own at least 50.1
percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women
who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements
such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control
an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised. However, upon a demonstration
that options or conversion rights held by non-controlled principals will not deprive the minority and female principals
of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated entity, a designated
entity may seek a waiver of the requirement that the equity of the minority and female principals must be calculated
on a fully-diluted basis. The term minority includes individuals of African American, Hispanic-surnamed, American
Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asian American extraction.

(3) Rural telephone companies. A rural telephone company is any local exchange carrier, including affiliates (as
defined in 1.2110(b)(4)), with 100,000 access lines or fewer.
(4) Affiliate. (1) An individual or entity is an affiliate of (a) an applicant or (b) a person holding an attributable
interest in an applicant under  24.709 (both referred to herein as `'the applicant'') if such individual or
entity_
(i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the applicant, or
(ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or
(iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties that also controls or has the power to control
the applicant, or
(v) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
(2) Nature of control in determining affiliation.
(i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.


Example.

 An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity.
Affiliation exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons,
are in control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power to control.
(ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern.
(iii) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that
no effective control can be established.


Example.

 In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
(3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with
an identity of interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. In determining if the
applicant controls or has the power to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though
they were one person.


Example.

 Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
(i) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by either of them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States. In calculating their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their share of
interests in property held jointly with a spouse.
(ii) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control
interests owned or controlled by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means
father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law,
brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother
or sister. This presumption may be rebutted by showing that (A) the family members are estranged, (B) the family ties
are remote, or (C) the family members are not closely involved with each other in business matters. Example: A owns
a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary sowing.
(4) Affiliation through stock ownership.
(i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
(ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of
a concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
(5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible
debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally considered to have a present
effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures,
and agreements are generally treated as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate
cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over another concern before it actually
does so.


Example 1.

 If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.


Example 2.

 If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, and option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its option
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effective in this case.


Example 3.

 If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the
merger has taken place.
(6) Affiliation under voting trusts.
(i) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at
will or to replace the trustee at will.
(ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor of the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
(iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.
(7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally arises where officers, directors, or key employees
serve as the majority or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or the management of another
entity.
(8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally arises where one concern shares office space
and/or employees and/or other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns are in the same
or related industry or field of operations, or where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other concern.
(9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation generally arises where one concern is dependent
upon another concern for contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or potential control,
of the other concern.
(10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
(i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
(ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated with each other.
(c) The Commission may set aside specific licenses for which only eligible designated entities, as specified by the
Commission, may bid.
(d) The Commission may permit partitioning of service areas in particular services for eligible designated entities.

(e) The Commission may permit small businesses (including small business owned by women, minorities, or rural telephone
companies that qualify as small businesses) and other entities determined to be eligible on a service-specific basis,
which are high bidders for licenses specified by the Commission, to pay the full amount of their high bids in installments
over the term of their licenses pursuant to the following:

(1) Unless otherwise specified, each eligible applicant paying for its license(s) on an installment basis must deposit
by wire transfer or cashier's check in the manner specified in  1.2107(b) sufficient additional funds as are
necessary to bring its total deposits to ten (10) percent of its winning bid(s) within five (5) business days after
the Commission has declared it the winning bidder and closed the bidding. Failure to remit the required payment will
make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant to  1.2104(g)(2).

(2) Within five (5) business days of the grant of the license application of a winning bidder eligible for installment
payments, the licensee shall pay another ten (10) percent of the high bid, thereby commencing the eligible licensee's
installment payment plan. Failure to remit the required payment will make the bidder liable to pay penalties pursuant
to  1.2104(g)(2).

(3) Upon grant of the license, the Commission will notify each eligible licensee of the terms of its installment payment
plan. Unless other terms are specified in the rules of particular services, such plans will:

(i) Impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations (with maturities closest to the duration of the
license term) at the time of licensing;

(ii) Allow installment payments for the full license term;

(iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and

(iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the license.

(4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment payments shall be conditioned upon the full and
timely performance of the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan.

(i) If an eligible entity making installment payments is more than ninety (90) days delinquent in any payment, it shall
be in default.

(ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the
Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering
whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment
history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the
reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial
condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission
grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue
to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license.

(iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission
will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to Part 1, Subpart O of the Commission's Rules.

(e) The Commission may award bidding credits (

et seq.,

 payments discounts) to eligible designated entities. Competitive bidding rules applicable to individual services
will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available,
the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures.

(f) The Commission may establish different upfront payment requirement for categories of designated entities in
competitive bidding rules of particular auctionable services.

(g) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of the available preferences or additional preferences.

(h) Designated entities must describe on their long-form applications how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility
for designated entity status, and must list and summarize on their long-form applications all agreements that effect
designated entity status, such as partnership agreements, shareholder agreements, management agreements and
other agreements, including oral agreements, which establish that the designated entity will have both 

de facto 

and 

de jure

 control of the entity. Such information must be maintained at the licensees' facilities or by their designated agents
for the term of the license in order to enable the Commission to audit designated entity eligibility on an ongoing basis.

(i) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit consortia, each member of which individually meets the
eligibility requirements, to qualify for any designated entity provisions.

(j) The Commission may, on a service-specific basis, permit publicly-traded companies that are owned by members
of minority groups or women to qualify for any designated entity provisions.



Section 1.2111 Assignment or Transfer of Control: Unjust Enrichment



(a) 

Reporting requirement. 

An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's
Rules) of a license within three years of receiving a new license through a competitive bidding procedure must, together
with its application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the Commission a statement indicating that
its license was obtained through competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the total consideration
that the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license. This information should
include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or other consideration (

e.g., 

management or consulting contracts either with or without an option to purchase; below market financing).

(b) 

Unjust enrichment payment: set-asides. 

As specified in this subsection, an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise
permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside
for eligible designated entities under  1.2110(c) of the Commission's Rules, or who proposes to take any other
action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek
Commission approval and may be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's
check or wire transfer before consent will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take account
of the term of the license, any applicable construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit,
which will be calculated as the difference between the amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the
value of a comparable non-set-aside license in the free market at the time of the auction. The Commission will establish
the amount of the Payment and the burden will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No Payment will be required
if:

(1) The license is transferred or assigned more than five years after its initial issuance, unless otherwise specified;
or

(2) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated entity under  1.2110(c) of the Commission's
Rules or the service-specific competitive bidding rules of the particular service, and so certifies.

(c) 

Unjust enrichment payment: installment financing. 

An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's
rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor through a competitive bidding procedure utilizing installment
financing available to designated entities under  1.2110(d) of the Rules will be required to pay the full amount
of the remaining principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. No payment will be required if the proposed
transferee or assignee assumes the installment payment obligations of the transferor or assignor, and if the proposed
transferee or assignee is itself qualified to obtain installment financing under  1.2110(d) of the Rules or
the service-specific competitive bidding rules of the particular service, and so certifies.

(d) 

Unjust enrichment payment: bidding credits. 

An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's
Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor through a competitive bidding procedure utilizing bidding
credits available to eligible designated entities under  1.2110(e) of the Rules, or who proposes to take any
other action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity,
must seek Commission approval and will be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the government
by wire transfer or cashier's check before consent will be granted. The Payment will be the sum of the amount of the bidding
credit plus interest at the rate applicable for installment financing in effect at the time the license was awarded.


See 

 1.2110(e). No payment will be required if the proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated entity
under  1.2110(e) of the Commission's Rules or the service-specific competitive bidding rules of the particular
service, and so certifies.

Cooperative Agreement for National Organizations' HIV/AIDS Prevention and Health Communications Programs; Health
Communications/Behavioral and Social Science Evaluation; and Technical Assistance Efforts in Support of Social
Marketing and Health Communications 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year (FY)
1995 funds for a cooperative agreement program with national organizations to support HIV/AIDS prevention and health
communications programs; health communications/behavioral and social science evaluation; and technical assistance
efforts_all in support of social marketing and health communications. These activities should be designed to increase
the reach, effectiveness, and impact of HIV prevention efforts. 
This announcement continues the HIV/AIDS prevention collaboration between CDC and national organizations that
was initiated in 1989 under Announcement 904, Cooperative Agreements for National Organizations and Consortiums
to Develop and Implement Effective AIDS Information, Education, and Programs among Constituents. 
A cooperative agreement is a legal agreement between CDC and the recipient in which CDC provides financial and other
assistance to, and has significant Federal programmatic involvement with, the recipient throughout the project.

For the Nation's HIV/AIDS prevention efforts to succeed, they must be focused on preventing and reducing behaviors
that place individuals at risk for HIV infection. Among the significant behavioral objectives necessary for preventing
HIV transmission, CDC has adopted the following three related to sexual behavior: 
 Young people who are not engaging in any form of sexual activity will maintain this behavior. 
 Sexually active people who use condoms consistently and correctly or are in a relationship with a mutually
faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will maintain these behaviors. 
 Sexually active people who are not in a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will refrain
from sexual activity, choose nonpenetrative sex, or use condoms consistently and correctly. 
These objectives cannot be met without the understanding, participation, and support of key sectors of the American
public. Coordination, collaboration, and communication between and among all sectors are crucial for successful
HIV prevention. These sectors include:

 

1. 

Public

 (e.g., health, social services, and education agencies); 
2. 

Voluntary

 (e.g., civic, social, health and health services, and youth-serving organizations that deliver education and community
services to the public); 
3. 

Professional and academic,

 the health communications/behavioral and social science and social marketing disciplines that must provide a scientific
basis for developing, implementing, refining, and evaluating HIV prevention efforts to ensure effective, behavior-focused
HIV interventions. 
4. 

Religious; 
5. Business and labor; 

and 
6. 

Media

, including print, radio, television, and entertainment media.

 

CDC has initiated a number of programs that are intended to focus on, and assist in, the development and implementation
of successful HIV prevention strategies for promoting healthy behavior reducing or eliminating individual risky
behaviors, and strengthening social norms that contribute to the prevention of HIV. These include the Prevention
Marketing Initiative (PMI) and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Programs. Specific information regarding
these two initiatives is included within the application package. To support these and other initiatives there is
a need to build the capacity of the sectors addressed in this program announcement to strengthen HIV prevention efforts.

CDC has a number of other HIV-related grant programs. This cooperative agreement targeting national organizations
is intended to complement these other programs and to include organizations essential for the development of a comprehensive
national HIV prevention program. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.
This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV infection. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000, see the
section entitled WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under sections 301(a) and 317(a) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 241(a) and
247b(a), as amended.

Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are national organizations (NOs), including national minority organizations (NMOs). All
applicants must provide documentation proving that they meet the following criteria: 

A. Be an established national (defined by charter or bylaws to operate nationally), nonprofit organization (a nongovernmental,
nonprofit corporation or association whose net earnings in no part accrue to the benefit of private shareholders
or individuals). Bylaws and/or charter must be furnished with the application. The following is acceptable evidence
of nonprofit status: 

*A copy of a currently valid Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax exemption certificate. 

B. A national minority organization must furnish a written statement that more than 50 percent of the board of directors
of said organization are racial or ethnic minority members. Groups recognized as racial and ethnic populations are:
African Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Caribbean Americans, Latinos/Hispanics,
and Pacific Islanders. 

Proof of nonprofit and organizational status and other eligibility criteria 

must 

be submitted with the application for determination of eligibility. No application will be accepted without proof
of nonprofit status. 

Assistance will be provided only to national organizations and national minority organizations as described above.
To help prevent the spread of HIV infection, CDC proposes to support such organizations which have existing networks
and constituents and the capacity to serve communities across the nation. This ensures that all communities_urban,
suburban, and rural_have both public and private sector resources to assist them in their prevention efforts. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $5 million is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 20 awards. It is expected that
the average award will be $125,000 per year, ranging from $100,000 to $200,000 per year. Awards to fund programs planned
for national minority organizations may range between $250,000 and $300,000 per year. In addition, one award of up
to $1,000,000 can be made to support a local condom availability social marketing demonstration project in three
communities. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about March 1, 1995. Funding estimates may vary and are
subject to change. 

Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. Grantees will be asked to submit yearly continuation applications, including verification of eligibility
requirements. 

Programmatic and budget justification are required for all applications. Applicants requesting funding as national
minority organizations will be considered separately from non-minority applicants. 

Subject to the availability of funds and the receipt of technically acceptable, fundable applications, at least
twelve awards are expected to be made to national organizations that target business, and labor, religious, voluntary,
media and other appropriate sectors (ranging from 2-5 awards per sector); at least two awards are expected to
be made to national professional or academic organizations, specific to health communications and/or behavior
and social sciences evaluation; at least one award is expected to be made to a national organization representing
public health; at least one award to a national organization that is qualified to effectively reach and impact gay,
bisexual, and lesbian audiences; at least two awards to national minority organizations for health communications;
and at least one award to a national organization to develop and implement a condom accessibility demonstration project
in at least three communities. 

Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project period. (

Budget period

 is the interval of time into which the project period is divided for funding and reporting purposes. 

Project period 

is the total time for which a project has been programmatically approved.) Continuation awards for years 2 and 3 within
an approved project period are made on the basis of satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. 

These funds may not supplant or duplicate existing funding from any other public or private source. Although contracts
with other organizations are allowable under these cooperative agreement awards, applicants themselves must perform
a substantial portion of the activities for which funds are requested. 

No funds will be provided for patient medical care or purchase of drugs or vaccines.

Purpose 



The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop partnerships with and among national organizations to effectively
extend the reach of CDC's HIV Prevention strategies (Prevention Marketing Initiative and the Business and Labor
Workplace HIV/AIDS Program) into communities to strengthen social norms that contribute to the prevention of HIV.




Program Requirements 



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities under B. (CDC Activities). 



A. Recipient Activities 



Applicant must develop a program plan based on realistic, specific, time-phased, and measurable objectives for
proposed activities and services, including technical assistance, for their affiliates, constituents or members.


The most successful comprehensive social marketing/health communications programs make individual-level behaviors
the central communications focus while addressing both the individual and the social systems and networks that influence
(predispose, enable, and reinforce) the behaviors of individuals. Applicant may choose to conduct one, several,
or all of the three Priority Activities listed below. 

Programs developed under any Priority Activity area must be implemented at the national level, and must be designed
to have an impact, ultimately, at the local level. All programs must be coordinated with CDC, national, regional,
State, and existing social marketing/health communications programs to prevent duplication of efforts, i.e.,
the Prevention Marketing Initiative and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Program. In addition CDC is currently
working with its national, State, and local HIV prevention partners to implement the HIV Prevention Community Planning
Initiative. An outcome of this initiative is that each health department recipient of an HIV prevention cooperative
agreement is to develop a comprehensive HIV prevention plan for its jurisdiction. Programs funded under Announcement
502 should be consistent with these State and local comprehensive HIV prevention plans. 

This announcement includes provisions to fund national minority organizations to develop, produce, disseminate,
and market health communications messages on HIV prevention. All such efforts must be culturally competent and linguistically
appropriate for the intended audience segments. 



Priority Activity 1
 



Participate in a comprehensive prevention marketing program targeted initially to persons 18 to 25 years of age designed
to decrease HIV risk behaviors, and/or to the social systems and networks, including communities, that influence,
support, and reinforce their sexual behaviors. Such efforts, including training and technical assistance, must
be undertaken in direct support of, and coordinated with, CDC's existing Prevention Marketing Initiative. 

Program activities may include the creation or utilization of systems, activities, and interventions that directly
influence individual behavior (these behaviors are those that place individuals at risk for HIV transmission).
They may also include activities designed to change or sustain individual behaviors by influencing social systems
and networks in relevant sectors of society that will affect individual behavior. These programs should strengthen
the abilities of public and private national, regional, State, and local organizations and consortia to provide
information, training, and/or technical assistance to their members, affiliates, or constituencies, and to apply
available resources creatively and effectively to reduce risk behaviors which contribute to the further spread
of HIV. 

A national program to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of an established social marketing program relevant
to CDC's Prevention Marketing Initiative may be undertaken. This program, must be undertaken in not less than three
communities across the country and must be based upon an already established, on-going, or recently completed social
marketing program. 

An example of such a program would be one that uses proven methods for community engagement and collaboration to involve
critical social/civic community leaders in promoting awareness of condom effectiveness in preventing disease.




Priority Activity 2




Build the capacity within relevant social systems and/or networks within a sector of society, and ultimately coordinate
with these systems, to participate in HIV prevention efforts. This can be done by providing technical assistance,
training, and/or information to organizations representing key sectors of society addressed in this program announcement
(e.g., business and labor, religious, voluntary, and media). 

Execution of this activity would involve the development and operation of HIV/AIDS technical assistance and training
programs to assist national, regional, State, and/or local organizations within defined social systems to implement
comprehensive, effective HIV prevention efforts. 

Examples of Priority 2 activities would be participation in one or more of the following programs: (1) the Business
and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Program, designed to assist the business and labor sector in developing and implementing
comprehensive workplace HIV/AIDS programs and to assist business and labor leaders in supporting and participating
in community HIV prevention efforts; (2) a broad effort to engage and develop the capacity of religious institutions
to participate in HIV prevention and services at the community level; or (3) a broad effort by a national voluntary
or media organization to educate its constituents, affiliates, and volunteers to participate in local HIV community
planning, education, and service activities.

Priority Activity 3



Support national professional and academic organizations in transferring technology and information specific
to health communications, social, and behavioral science research and evaluation to assist governmental and nongovernmental
organizations in effective HIV prevention planning, intervention design, or evaluation.

<DOCTITLE>Public Health Conference Support Cooperative Agreement Program </DOCTITLE>
for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year (FY)
1995 funds for the Public Health Conference Support Cooperative Agreement Program for Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) Prevention. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention
objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the
quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV Infection. (To order a copy of Healthy People
2000 or CDC's Strategic Plan for Preventing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection (July 8, 1992), see the
Section Where to Obtain Additional Information.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under Sections 301 [42 U.S.C. 241] and 310 [42 U.S.C. 242n] of the Public Health Service
Act, as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are non-governmental, nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges,
research institutions, hospitals, other public and private (e.g., national, regional) organizations, federally
recognized Indian tribal governments, Indian tribes or Indian tribal organizations, and small, minority- or women-owned
businesses are eligible for these cooperative agreements. Current recipients of CDC HIV funding must provide the
award number and title of the funded program (see the Section Program Requirements, C. Letter of Intent). 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $250,000 is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 10 to 15 awards. The awards will
average $20,000 and will be funded for a 12-month budget and project period. The funding estimate may vary and is subject
to change, based on availability of funds. Awards will initially be made on a contingency basis as described in the
Purpose section. 
The following are examples of the most frequently encountered costs that may or may not be charged to the cooperative
agreement: 
1. As approved, CDC funds may be used for direct cost expenditures: salaries, speaker fees, rental of conference related
equipment, registration fees, and transportation cost (not to exceed economy class fares) for non-Federal employees.

2. CDC funds may not be used for the purchase of equipment, payments of honoraria, organizational dues, entertainment
or personal expenses, cost of travel and payment of a full-time Federal employee, or per diem or expenses, other than
mileage, for local participants. 
3. CDC funds may not be used for reimbursement of indirect costs. 
4. Although the practice of handing out novelty items at meetings is often employed in the private sector to provide
participants with souvenirs, Federal funds cannot be used for this purpose. 
5. CDC funds may be used for only those parts of the conference specifically supported by CDC as documented in the Notice
of Cooperative Agreement (award document). 


Recipient Financial Participation 


CDC will not fund 100% of any conference proposed under this announcement.

Purpose 


The purpose of the HIV-related conference support cooperative agreement is to provide partial support for non-Federal
conferences to stimulate efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. CDC will collaborate on conferences that specifically
focus on preventing HIV transmission. Because conference support by CDC creates the appearance of CDC co-sponsorship,
there will be active participation by CDC in the development and approval of those portions of the agenda supported
by CDC funds. CDC funds may not be expended for unsupported portions of conferences. Contingency awards will be made
allowing usage of only 25% of the total amount to be awarded until a final full agenda is approved by CDC. This will provide
funds for costs associated with preparation of the agenda. The remainder of funds will be released only upon acceptance
of the final full agenda. CDC reserves the right to terminate co-sponsorship if it does not approve the final agenda.



Program Requirements 


CDC will provide support for conferences that are: (1) regional (more than one State), national, or international
in scope and target professionals contributing to HIV prevention efforts; and (2) focused on the transfer of HIV prevention
research and evaluation findings to intervention efforts or the application of these prevention efforts to service
providers and health professional who provide service to individuals whose behaviors place them at increased risk
for HIV infection. 
Topics concerned with issues and areas other than HIV prevention should be directed to other public health agencies
or in accordance with current 

Federal Register

 Notices (see 

Federal Register

 Notice 501 published on April 19, 1994, 59 FR 18561). Current recipients of CDC HIV funding must provide the award number
and title of the funded program (see the Section Program Requirements, C. Letter of Intent). 
The activities related to the development of HIV prevention conferences require substantial CDC collaboration
and involvement. In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipient shall be responsible
for conducting activities listed in section A, and CDC will be responsible for conducting activities listed in section
B: 


A. Recipient Activities 


1. Manage all activities related to program content (e.g., objectives, topics, attenders, session design, workshops,
special exhibits, speakers, fees, agenda composition, and printing). Many of these items may be developed in concert
with assigned CDC project personnel. 
2. Provide draft copies of the agenda and proposed ancillary activities to CDC for acceptance. Submit a copy of the
final agenda and proposed ancillary activities to CDC for acceptance. 
3. Determine and manage all promotional activities (e.g., title, logo, announcements, mailers, press). CDC must
review and approve the use of any materials with reference to CDC involvement or support. 
4. Manage all registration processes with participants, invitees, and registrants (e.g., travel, reservations,
correspondence, conference materials and hand-outs, badges, registration procedures). 
5. Plan, negotiate, and manage conference site arrangements, including all audio-visual needs. 
6. Develop and conduct education and training programs on HIV prevention. 
7. Collaborate with CDC staff in reporting and disseminating results and relevant HIV prevention education and training
information to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, health-care providers, HIV/AIDS prevention and
service organizations, and the general public. 


B. CDC Activities 


1. Provide technical assistance through telephone calls, correspondence, and site visits in the areas of program
agenda development, implementation, and priority setting related to the cooperative agreement.

2. Provide scientific collaboration for appropriate aspects of the program, including selection of speakers, pertinent
scientific information on risk factors for HIV infection, preventive measures, and program strategies for the prevention
of HIV infection. 
3. Review draft agendas and approve the final agenda and proposed ancillary activities prior to release of restricted
funds. 
4. Assist in the reporting and dissemination of research results and relevant HIV prevention education and training
information to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, health-care providers, the scientific community,
and HIV/AIDS prevention and service organizations, and the general public.
 

C. Letter of Intent
 

Potential applicants must submit a one-page, typewritten letter of intent (LOI) that briefly describes the title,
location, and purpose of the meeting, its relationship to the CDC Funding Priorities (see the section Funding Priorities),
the date of the proposed conference, and the intended audience (number and description). No attachments, booklets,
or other documents accompanying the LOI will be considered. The letter should also include the estimated total cost
of the conference and the percentage of the total cost (which must be less than 100%) being requested from CDC. Current
recipients of CDC HIV funding must provide the award number and title of the funded program. LOIs will be reviewed by
CDC program staff, and an invitation to submit a final application will be made based on the proposed conference's
relationship to the CDC Funding Priorities and the availability of funds. An invitation to submit an application
does not constitute a commitment by CDC to fund the applicant.


 


Note: 

To provide for adequate time to collaborate on the meeting agenda and content, applicants should allow a minimum of
3 months from the scheduled application due date to the planned date of the conference. (See the section Letter of Intent
and Application Submission and Deadline.) Meetings which are scheduled to begin earlier than April 1, 1995, would
not be routinely considered for funding.
 

Evaluation Criteria
 

LOIs will be reviewed by CDC program staff for consistency with CDC's HIV prevention goals and priorities and the purpose
of this program. An invitation to submit a final application will be made on the basis of the proposed conference's
relationship to the CDC topics of special interest, the timing of the meeting or conference that would allow for CDC
input, and on the availability of funds. Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria
(TOTAL POINTS AVAILABLE IS 100):
 

A. Proposed Program and Technical Approach: (50 Points)
 

Evaluation will be based on:
 1. The applicant's description of the proposed conference as it relates to HIV prevention and education, including
the public health need of the proposed conference and the degree to which the conference can be expected to influence
public health practices, and the extent of the applicant's collaboration with other agencies serving the intended
audience, including local health and education agencies concerned with HIV prevention.
 2. The applicant's description of conference objectives in terms of quality and specificity and the feasibility
of the conference based on the operational plan, and the extent to which evaluation mechanisms for the conference
will be able to adequately assess increased knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of the target attenders.
 3. The quality of the proposed agenda in addressing the chosen HIV prevention/education topic.
 4. The degree to which conference activities proposed for CDC funding strictly adhere to the prevention of HIV transmission.
 

B. APPLICANT CAPABILITY: (25 Points)
 

Evaluation will be based on:
 1. The adequacy and commitment of institutional resources to administer the program.

<TEXT>
 

2. The adequacy of existing and proposed facilities and resources for conducting conference activities. 
 3. The degree to which the applicant has established and used critical linkages with health and education agencies
with the mandate for HIV prevention (letters of support from such agencies should demonstrate the linkages specific
to the conference). 
 

C. Qualifications of Program Personnel: (25 Points) 
 

Evaluation will be based on: 
 1. The qualifications, experience, and commitment of the principal staff person, and his/her ability to devote adequate
time and effort to provide effective leadership. 
 2. The competence of associate staff persons, discussion leaders, and speakers to accomplish conference objectives.

 3. The degree to which the application demonstrates an appropriate knowledge level of all key personnel about the
transmission of HIV, as well as nationwide information and education efforts currently underway that may affect,
and be affected by, the proposed conference. 
 

D. Budget Justification and Adequacy of Facilities: (Not Scored) 
 

The proposed budget will be evaluated on the basis of its reasonableness, concise and clear justification, consistency
with the intended use of cooperative agreement funds, and the extent to which the applicant documents financial support
from other sources. 
 

Funding Priorities 
 

Funding priorities are established to ensure a balance of CDC HIV prevention funding and to address at risk populations
that are underserved. CDC is especially interested in supporting meetings and conferences on the following topics:

 1. Prevention of HIV infection among: (A) underserved populations (e.g., women of reproductive age, racial and ethnic
minorities), (B) high risk populations, including both in-and out-of-school youth, or (C) populations in special
settings (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, out-of-school youth, incarcerated persons, men who have sex with
men, and migrant workers). Particular interest will be given to populations who may be affiliated with multiple groups
(e.g., gay men of color). 
 2. HIV prevention in health-care settings. 
 3. Development of HIV prevention strategies with a broad range of community partners including those who have not
traditionally been involved with public health programs (e.g., business, religious leaders). 
 4. Development of prevention marketing strategies, including various behavior modification messages related
to sexual practices (e.g., abstinence, condom use). 
 
Public comments are not being solicited regarding funding priority because time does not permit solicitation and
review prior to the funding date.

Announcement of Cooperative Agreements to the Minority Health Professions Foundation



The Public Health Service announces that certain of its components will enter into umbrella cooperative agreements
with the Minority Health Professions Foundation (MHPF), the education arm of the Association of Minority Health
Professions Schools (AMHPS). It is anticipated that the components of PHS listed below will negotiate an umbrella
cooperative agreement with MHPF. These cooperative agreements will establish the broad programmatic framework
within which specific projects can be funded as they are identified during the project period. The PHS components
are: the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; the Office of Minority Health, Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Health; the Health Resources and Services Administration; and the Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research.

The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to (1) foster cooperation and collaboration among the Minority Health
Professions schools and (2) to assist the AMHPS member institutions in expanding and enhancing their educational
and research opportunities, with the ultimate goal of improving the health status of minorities and disadvantaged
people.



Eligible Applicant



Assistance will be provided only to MHPF. No other applications are solicited. MHPF is the only organization capable
of administering these cooperative agreements because it is the only organization that has:




1. Established a comprehensive database related to teaching and other activities of all African-American medical,
dental, pharmacy and veterinary schools;

2. Developed and evaluated an inventory of essential disease prevention and health promotion skills needed by all
medical and health profession students;

3. Assessed the current education, research and disease prevention and health promotion activities for students
and its member institutions;

4. Developed a national organization whose member institutions are all predominately minority health professions
institutions with excellent professional performance records;

5. Developed an inventory of critical knowledge, skills and abilities related to instruction in medical and health
professional preparation. Through the collective efforts of its member institutions, the MHPF has demonstrated
(1) the ability to work with academic institutions and official health agencies on mutual education, service, and
research endeavors and (2) the leadership necessary to attract minority health professionals into public health
careers.




These cooperative agreements will be awarded in FY 1995 for a 12-month budget period within a project period of five
years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds.

Notice of Extension of CDBG Direct Homeownership Assistance Eligibility 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of extension of eligibility.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice extends the termination date for the direct homeownership assistance provision at section 105(a)(25)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Extension of Termination Date


In accordance with title IX, section 907(b)(2) of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA), as amended by
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the Department has determined that extension of the termination
date for the direct homeownership provision at section 105(a)(25) of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1974, as amended, is necessary to continue to provide homeownership assistance until homeownership assistance
is available under title II of NAHA, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. Therefore, the termination date is
hereby extended from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995. 
For CDBG entitlement communities, HUD-administered Small Cities grantees in Hawaii, and for Insular Area grantees,
no CDBG funds may be expended for any activity eligible under the direct homeownership provision unless the funds
are obligated to a homebuyer before October 1, 1995. For the State CDBG program, HUD-administered Small Cities program
in New York, and the Indian CDBG program, no funds for homeowner assistance may be expended unless a grant for such activities
was made by the State or by HUD, as appropriate, before October 1, 1995 to a unit of general local government, and then
only for such amounts as are specifically approved. 


II. Basis for Determination


The basis for the extension is the Department's determination that assistance to homebuyers would not be fully available
under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program by October 1, 1994. The first-time homebuyer and resale restriction
provisions of the HOME program have proven difficult for many participating jurisdictions (PJs) to implement. Recent
amendments to the HOME regulations intended to facilitate funding homebuyer assistance under the HOME program have
not yet been in effect long enough to be fully implemented by HOME PJs. Funding homebuyer assistance under the HOME
program is especially difficult for CDBG grantees that are not HOME PJs. 
The recent changes to the HOME homebuyer provisions are both statutory and regulatory. Statutory changes to the definition
of eligible homebuyers and to the recapture provisions were enacted in section 203 of the Multifamily Housing Property
Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 102-233, approved April 11, 1994). These changes were implemented by
a memorandum dated May 10, 1994 and a rule published on August 26, 1994 (59 FR 44258), but PJs have not yet had time to redesign
their HOME programs to reflect the amendments. Similarly, the April 19, 1994, interim rule for the HOME program (59
FR 18626) offers additional flexibility by changing the basis for determining the affordability period applicable
to homebuyer units and provides additional guidance on recapture provisions. PJs have not yet had time to incorporate
these changes into their programs. The Department is also still in the process of developing model documents that
may be used by PJs for such activities. 
The lack of time to implement the HOME program changes and the resulting limits on the availability of funds is especially
problematic for CDBG entitlements that are not HOME PJs. Without CDBG funds available for direct homeownership assistance,
these communities would have to wait for the next State HOME program funding rounds to get funding for this purpose.
In most States, the next funding round following the above-referenced statutory and regulatory changes will not
be until after October 31, 1994. This extension will allow smaller CDBG communities to provide continuous funding
for direct homeownership activities until such CDBG entitlements have a reasonable chance of receiving State HOME
funds. 
In making this determination to extend the CDBG homeownership provision, the Department is acting in accord with
its national initiative to increase homebuyer assistance, particularly for lower-income families. This initiative
includes Departmental proposals to extend permanently the CDBG direct homeownership provision, bolster the HOPE
programs, expand the Single Family Property Disposition Initiative, and develop additional homebuyer program
models under the HOME program.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Property Suitable as Facilities to Assist the Homeless</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless

 v. 

Veterans Administration,

 No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.,

 acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: U.S. Army: Elaine Sims, CECPW-FP, U.S. Army Center for Public
Works, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3862; (703) 355-3475; (This is not a toll-free number).

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Draft Recovery Plan for the Kauai Plant Cluster for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft Kauai Plant Cluster
Recovery Plan. There are 37 taxa of plants included in this plan. All but seven of the taxa are or were endemic to the Hawaiian
island of Kauai. The plants that are not endemic to Kauai are or were also found on the islands of Niihau, Oahu, Molokai,
Maui, and/or Hawaii.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. Substantive technical
comments will result in changes to the plans. Substantive comments regarding recovery plan implementation may not
necessarily result in changes to the recovery plans, but will be forwarded to appropriate Federal or other entities
so that they can take these comments into account during the course of implementing recovery actions. Individualized
responses to comments will not be provided.

The 37 plant taxa being considered in the draft Kauai Plant Cluster Recovery Plan are: 

Brighamia insignis 

('olulu), 

Chamaesyce halemanui 

(no common name (NCN)), 

Cyanea asarifolia

All but seven of the taxa are or were endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai; the exceptions are or were found on the Hawaiian
islands of Niihau, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and/or the island of Hawaii as well as Kauai. The 37 plant taxa and their habitats
have been variously affected or are currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation by feral
and domestic animals (goats, pigs, axis and mule deer, cattle, and red jungle fowl); competition for space, light,
water, and nutrients by introduced vegetation; erosion of substrate produced by human- or animal-caused disturbance;
recreational and agricultural activities; habitat loss from fires; disease; loss of pollinators; and predation
by animals (goats, rats and mice). Due to the small number of existing individuals and their very narrow distributions,
these taxa and most of their populations are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or reduced reproductive
vigor from stochastic events. 

The taxa included in this plan were historically distributed throughout the island of Kauai and grow in a variety of
vegetation communities (grassland, shrubland, and forests), elevational zones (coastal to montane), and moisture
regimes (dry to wet). Most of the taxa included in this plan persist on steep slopes, precipitous cliffs, valley headwalls,
and other regions where unsuitable topography has prevented agricultural development or where inaccessibility
has limited encroachment by alien animal and plant taxa.

The objective of this plan is to provide a framework for the recovery of these 37 taxa so that their protection by the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) is no longer necessary. Immediate actions necessary for the prevention of extinction
of these taxa include fencing for exclusion of ungulates, alien plant control, protection from fire, population
and plant community monitoring and management, 

ex situ

 propagation, and augmentation of populations, as appropriate. Long-term activities necessary for the perpetuation
of these taxa in their natural habitats additionally include baseline and long-term research regarding growth requirements,
public education, maintenance of fenced areas, long-term monitoring and management of populations and communities,
and re-establishment of populations within the historic ranges of some taxa. Further research current range, reproduction
and reproductive status, pollinators, life history, limiting factors, habitat requirements, and minimum viable
population sizes is needed to facilitate appropriate management decisions regarding the long-term perpetuation
of each of these taxa. 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of these plans. 



Authority 



The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

The draft Wainae Plant Cluster Recovery Plan addresses 31 plant taxa that have been listed as endangered under the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), in four listing actions between September 1991 and June 1994: 

Abutilon sandwicense, Alsinidendron obovatum, Alsinidendron trinerve, Centaurium sebaeoides

 (`awiwi), 

Chamaesyce celastroides

 var. 

Kaenana 

(`akoko), 

Chamaesyce kuwaleana

 (`akoko), 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 (haha), 

Cyanea pinnatifida

 (haha), 

Cyanea superba, Diellia falcata, Diellia unisora, Dubautia herbstobatae

 (na'ena'e), 

Gouania meyenii, Gouania vitifolia, Hedyotis degeneri, Hedyotis parvula, Hesperomannia arbuscula, Lipochaeta
lobata

 var. 

leptophylla

 (nehe), 

Lipochaeta tenuifolia

 (nehe), 

Lobelia niihauensis, Neraudia angulata, Nototrichium humile

 (kulu'i), 

Phyllostegia mollis, Sanicula mariversa, Schiedea kaalae, Silene perlmanii, Stenogyne kanehoana, Tetramolopium
filiforme, Tetramolopium lepidotum

 ssp. 

lepidotum Urera kaalae

 (opuhe), and 

Viola chamissoniana

 ssp. 

chamissoniana

 (pamakani). Twenty-six taxa are either endemic to, or have their largest or best known populations in, the Waianae
Mountain Range on the western side of the island of Oahu, Hawaii.

The 31 plant tasa and their habitats have been adversely threatened in various degrees by one or more of the following:
trampling and predation by introduced ungulates (pigs, cattle, goats); habitat degradation and competition for
space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized, alien vegetation; and habitat loss from fires. A few of these taxa
may have been subjected to overcollection and are subject to trampling by human beings along trails. Because of the
small number of extant individuals and severely restricted distributions, populations of these tasa are subject
to an increased likelihood of extinction from stochastic events.

The ultimate objective of this plan is to provide a framework for the eventual recovery of these 31 taxa, preferably
so that their protection by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is no longer necessary. Immediate actions necessary
for the prevention of extinction of these taxa include fencing for exclusion of ungulates, alien plant control, protection
from fire, population and plant community monitoring and management, 

ex situ

 propagation, and augmentation of populations, as appropriate. Long-term activities necessary for the perpetuation
of these taxa in their natural habitats additionally include baseline and long-term research regarding growth requirements,
public education, maintenance of fenced areas, long-term monitoring and management of populations and communities,
and re-establishment of populations within the historic ranges of some taxa. Further research regarding current
range, reproduction and reproductive status, pollinators, life history, limiting factors, habitat requirements,
and minimum viable population sizes is needed to facilitate appropriate management decisions regarding the long-term
perpetuation of each of these taxa.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of these plans.



Authority



The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), the United States publishes below
the comments received on the proposed Final Consent Judgment in United States and State of Florida v. Morton Plant
Health System, Inc., and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. Civil No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E, United

The United States' Response To Public Comments



Pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h) (the ``APPA''),
the United States hereby submits and responds to the public comments it has received regarding the proposed Final
Consent Judgment (``Judgment'') in this civil antitrust proceeding.

This action began on May 5, 1994, when the United States and the State of Florida filed a Verified Complaint alleging
that the proposed consolidation of Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. would tend
to substantially lessen competition in the provision of acute inpatient hospital services in North Pinellas County,
Florida in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  18. On June 17, 1994, the parties filed
a Stipulation and a proposed Judgment, and on July 1, the United States filed a Competitive Impact Statement regarding
the proposed Judgment.

As explained in the Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed Judgment permits Morton Plant and Mease to achieve
cost savings by consolidating some hospital and administrative services, but it enjoins the proposed consolidation
and requires Morton Plant and Mease to continue competing in the provision of inpatient hospital services as separate
corporate entities, thus preserving that competition upon which consumers have relied to reduce the cost of hospital
care.

The APPA requires a sixty-day period for the submission of public comments on the proposed Judgment [15 U.S.C. 16(b)].
The sixty-day comment period expired on September 12, 1994. The United States received two comments. The comments
and the United States' response to these comments are being published with this notice.
 What follows is a brief summary of the comments and the United States' response.




1. The Textile Rental Services Association criticized language in the proposed Judgment that, the Association claims,
would authorize Morton Plant and Mease to establish a tax-exempt joint venture to provide hospital laundry services.
Currently, such a venture would not be tax-exempt. The United States' response to this comment points out that, in
drafting the proposed Judgment, the parties did not intend to create any new federal or state tax exemption. Morton
Plant and Mease confirmed in writing that they neither intend, nor will they interpret, the proposed Judgment to provide
them with any such tax-exemption.
In our view, the parties' written commitment that they will not interpret the proposed Judgment as creating or providing
any new federal or state tax exemption fully meets the Textile Rental Services Association's concern that the Judgment
could be read to provide such tax relief. A key point, however, is that the criticism about the tax consequences of the
proposed Judgment is entirely unrelated to the key issue before the Court: the effectiveness of the Judgment in remedying
the antitrust violation alleged in the Complaint.
2. Ms. Ann E. Castro, who represents an employment agency for temporary nurses, criticized provisions of the proposed
Judgment that would permit Morton Plant and Mease to combine their purchases of temporary nursing services. She believes
that the hospitals' joint venture might decide to purchase nursing services from foreign-born nurses, who, she claims,
typically charge less than the nurses her client represents.
In response, the United States pointed out that purchasing nursing services at lower prices is a legitimate, pro-competitive
goal. A reduction in Morton Plant's and Mease's costs for nursing services would likely translate into lower charges
for hospital care, and hence, benefit health care consumers. Consequently, this criticism does not warrant rejecting
the proposed Judgment, but instead underscores its salutory effect.

Re: Public Comment on Proposed Final Consent Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement in the matter
of United States and State of Florida 

v. 

Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc., 

No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E (M.D. Fla., Filed May 5, 1994).




Dear Ms. Kursh:



This letter is filed on behalf of this firm's client, the Textile Rental Services Association (``TRSA'') with respect
to the above-captioned action (the ``Stipulation''), in partial objection to the terms of the Stipulation.

TRSA is a nonprofit trade association. Its mission is to protect, promote, and professionalize the industry of its
members, which are companies engaged in textile maintenance and provision of rental services to commercial, industrial
and institutional accounts. Members of TRSA account for about 90 percent of the annual sales of the linen supply industry
and about 75 percent of the sales of the industrial laundering industry. The combined textile rental industry had
estimated 1993 sales of about $6 billion. Linen supply and industrial laundering companies employ 110,000 people.

Article II, paragraph (G), and Article V, paragraph (B) of the Stipulation, as published in the Wednesday, July 13,
1994 Federal Register (59 Fed. Reg. 35,752, 35754) provide that Morton Plant Health System (``Morton Plant'') and
Trustees of Mease Hospital (``Mease'') may form a ``nonprofit, tax-exempt organization'' which ``may own and operate
any . . . Eligible Partnership Administrative Service and may provide such service to Morton Plan
and Mease.'' The Stipulation defines ``Eligible Partnership Administrative Service'' to include, among other
things, ``housekeeping and laundry'' services and ``all miscellaneous services not related to patient care and
not exceeding an expenditure of $250,000.00 annually.''

As is discussed in greater detail below, the implication in the Stipulation that a tax-exempt organization may perform
laundry services is 

directly 

contrary to law, and the open-ended grant of authority to perform ``miscellaneous services'' may be interpreted
in a manner which is inconsistent with law. TRSA objects to the content and potential effect of these provisions.

The Supreme Court specifically ruled in 

HCSC-Laundry 

v. 

United States, 

450 U.S. 1,101 S.Ct. 836, 67 L.ED.2d 1 (1981) that a ``cooperative hospital service organization'' formed for the
express purpose of providing laundry services for two or more hospitals (which were themselves tax-exempt organizations
under  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) was not eligible for tax 

exempt status. 

Section 501(e) of the Internal Revenue Code directly addresses the capacity of a hospital service organization to
qualify for tax exempt status, and provides a list of services which such qualified organizations can perform. Laundry
services are not expressly nor implicitly included in that list.






The petitioner in 

HCSC Laundry 

asserted that the list of services in  501(e) was not intended as an exclusive list, and that the service entity
providing laundry services could qualify for tax-exempt status under the general qualification standards of  501(c)(3)
applied to other companies. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner's argument, and upheld the Third Circuit's
ruling that compliance with  501(e) was, in fact, the only way for a hospital service organization to attain
tax-exempt status. The Court noted that the omission of laundry services from  501(e) by lawmakers in 1968 was
not inadvertent, and that the inclusion of laundry services was expressly considered and rejected in 1968 (during
original legislative action), and 1976 (when an effort was made to amend the law to include laundry services). 101
S. Ct. at 839.

We acknowledge that the issues before the District Court and the Department of Justice, and the compromises contained
in the Stipulation, focus on antitrust and anticompetitive concerns and that the Stipulation is not necessarily
cognizant of federal income tax implications. Nevertheless, the Stipulation implies a range of authority which
is inconsistent with current law, and we urge you to revise the Stipulation to reflect current law on permissible tax-exempt
activities for hospital service organizations.

TRSA requests the opportunity to submit further comments or to otherwise participate in any other proceeding concerning
this subject. Please contact the undersigned if you have any questions regarding the foregoing, or if you need any
further information.

Re: Public Comment on Proposed Consent Decree in United States and State of Florida v. Morton Plant Health Systems,
Inc., et al., No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E (M.D. Fla., filed May 5, 1994)



Dear Mr. Fellman: 

This letter responds to your recent letter, submitted on behalf of the Textile Rental Service Association, commenting
on the possible tax ramifications of the joint venture that Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease
Hospital, Inc. are permitted to establish under the terms of the proposed consent decree in this case. 

In your letter, your correctly point out that the proposed decree authorizes Morton Plant and Mease to form a ``nonprofit,
tax-exempt organization'' that ``may own and operate [and provide to Morton Plant and Mease] any * * *
Eligible Partnership Administrative Service,'' and that such services may include inter alia, 

``housekeeping and laundry'' services and ``all miscellaneous services not related to patient care and not exceeding
an expenditure of $250,000 annually.'' Final Consent Judgment   II (G) and V(B). This language could
be read to imply that the partnership organized under the decree can perform laundry services and other unspecified
miscellaneous services and remain a ``nonprofit, tax-exempt organization'' under federal tax laws. 

However, current federal tax statutes and court decisions interpreting them indicate that a ``cooperative hospitals
service organization'' formed to provide laundry services for two or more non-profit hospital is 

not 

eligible for tax exempt status. 

HCSC-Laundry v. United States, 

450 U.S. 1, 6-8 (1981). It is also quite possible that a joint venture formed by the hospitals to provide other
``miscellaneous services not related to patient care''_and not specifically listed as a tax-exempt service in Section
501(e) of the Internal Revenue Code_would not be entitled to tax-exempt status. 

The United States certainly does not view this consent decree as affording Morton Plant or Mease a new exemption from
federal (or state) taxes. Moreover, Morton Plant and Mease have provided written assurances that they do not intend
to interpret the consent decree as providing an amendment to or exemption under any tax law. (A copy of that written
assurance from the hospitals' trial counsel is enclosed.) 

In short, the proposed consent decree is clearly not intended, and should not be read, to alter or amend tax laws, rules,
or regulations, or to create any new tax exemptions or loopholes. In order to qualify for tax-exempt status, the hospitals'
joint venture must satisfy any applicable tax regulations, not simply rely upon the language of the proposed decree.


I trust that this responds to the concerns you have expressed. Thank you for your keen interest in the enforcement of
our federal antitrust and tax laws.



Sincerely yours,

It is my understanding that you requested written assurances in reference to one of the comments received in relation
to the Consent Decree. In that regard, please accept this correspondence as my clients' written assurance that they
do not intend to violate the tax laws in relation to implementation of this Consent Decree, nor do they intend to claim
any exemption to which they are not entitled, nor did they intend, nor do they interpret the Consent Decree to give them
any additional exemptions not provided for in the tax codes, federal or state. This matter has been reviewed by appropriate
tax counsel who are advising the entities accordingly. If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to
call.

In Re: United States and State of Florida v. Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. No.
94-748-CIV-T-23E (M.D., Fla., Filed May 5, 1994)



On behalf of my client, a nursing contractor doing business in Pinellas County Florida, this public comment is being
submitted as there is considerable concern that the combination of Morton Plant and Mease may substantially lessen
competition in the provision of health care services in North Pinellas County in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 18.
Specifically, the gravamen of my client's concern lies in the suspicion that should the merger go forward, staff relief
nurses and other health care professionals will be injured. At 59 Fed. Reg. 357555 (July 13, 1994), Part VI (B) Independent
Activities, the Final Consent Judgment reads as follows:
Morton Plant and Mease shall each price and sell its services, both those owned and operated and operated separately
and those purchased from the Partnership, in active competition with each other. Morton Plant and Mease shall each
exercise its own independent judgment on how to market and price its patient care services and shall not discuss, communicate,
or exchange with each other or any other hospital information relating to the marketing, pricing, negotiating, or
contracting of any patient care services, including those purchased from the Partnership.
On information and belief Morton Plant has participated in predatory pricing. Morton Plant together with nineteen
of twenty-three major hospitals in the Tampa Bay area previously engaged in activities which set forth a federal anti-trust
investigation. This investigation was conducted in 1988-9 to look into alleged abuses by the hospitals. An
organization by the name of SASSA alleged that the nineteen hospitals were acting in concert to attempt to eliminate
competition in the staff relief nurse industry throughout the Tampa Bay area, and to drive prices below community
standards for the relief nurses.
Although the federal investigation of the anti-trust activities ended when the hospitals dropped their plan, the
hospitals have continued to act in concert to try to eliminate competition in the staff relief nurse industry and to
drive prices below community standards for the relief nurses. A new alliance was formed after the 1988-9 investigation
called the Bay Area Hospital Council. (BAHC). BAHC has actively recruited foreign nurses to supply area hospitals
with cheaper temporary nurses, and this collective activity has further damaged the nursing contractor that this
firm represents, as the foreign relief nurses have been working for wages well below community standards for temporary
nurses.
Although Morton Plant has engaged in utilizing relief nurses on H-1A nurses, Mease has not. The nursing contractor
this firm represents has been doing business with Mease, but had been doing no business at all with Morton Plant, until
the contractor would agree to do business with Morton Plant at rates below community standards for relief workers.
This demand for cheaper rates commanded by Morton Plant has still not translated into significant return of business
to the contractor who had historically provided Morton Plant with a large portion of its staff relief nurses.
Should the merger go forward, there will certainly be an adverse affect on staff relief nurses desiring to work in north
Pinellas County, in that their ability to work at Mease Hospital will be uncertain, should Mease be influenced by the
practices that Morton Plant has adopted.
Further information has been supplied to Jerome Hoffman of the Florida Attorney General's Office in Tallahassee,
Florida.

Re: Public Comment on Proposed Consent Decree in United States and State of Florida v. Morton Plant Health System,
Inc., et al., No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E (M.D. Fla., filed May 5, 1994)



Dear Ms. Castro:


This letter responds to your September 12, 1994 letter regarding the potential impact of the proposed consent decree
on competition in the provision of temporary nursing services to Tampa Bay area hospitals.
As I understand your concerns, your client is an employment agency that supplies temporary nurses to hospitals in
the Tampa Bay area, including Mease. Apparently, your client has had difficulty competing in the provision of nursing
services because Morton Plant and 19 other area hospitals, acting through a trade association, Bay Area Hospital
Association, actively recruit foreign-born nurses, who, you say, are willing to work at temporary positions at much
cheaper rates than the nurses your client employs. You believe that if Morton Plant and Mease combine their purchases
of nursing services, as they are permitted to do under the proposed consent decree, their joint venture may elect to
purchase the services of foreign-born nurses, rather than continue doing business with your client.
In our view, the concerns you have expressed provide no justification for reconsidering the merits of the proposed
decree. First, the factual premise of your argument_that Morton Plant favors the use of foreign-born temporary nurses_is
suspect. There is no evidence that Morton Plant, in fact, routinely fills temporary nursing positions at its hospitals
with lower-paid foreign-born nationals. The materials you submitted to the Florida Attorney General's Office in
support of your complaint indicate that, as recently as 1992, Morton Plant did not hire a single foreign national as
a temporary nurse.
Second, neither hospital is today precluded from hiring foreign-born nurses to fill temporary positions, and there
is no proper basis for restricting the joint venture's hiring of foreign-born nurses. Indeed, such employment discrimination
is likely unlawful.
Finally, even if Morton Plant routinely fills temporary nursing positions with lower-paid foreign nationals, and
the hospital joint venture organized pursuant to the decree adopts that practice and expands it to Mease, paying less
expensive rates for nursing services is likely to have significant procompetitive effects. This practice promises
to reduce the cost of nursing care at these hospitals, and it has not been suggested that that will lead to any diminution
in the quality of care. The reduction in nursing costs will likely lead to a reduction in prices paid for hospital-related
services, precisely the pro-consumer result the parties anticipated when they agreed to the settlement now pending
before the Court.
I trust this information will help you to understand the basis for the Department's action and the proposed settlement
in this matter. Thank you for sharing your views with us.



Sincerely yours,

<DOCTITLE>Jovencio Raneses, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>



On August 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Jovencio Raneses, M.D. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Dr. Raneses'
(Respondent) DEA Certificate of Registration, AR2526171, and deny any pending applications for registration as
a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration
was proper pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a) (1), (2), and (4).

In particular, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration was inconsistent with the
public interest in light of his prescribing of controlled substances to individuals in the absence of a legitimate
medical purpose, his felony conviction for issuance of a controlled substance prescription in violation of California
law, and his material falsification of a new application for registration with the DEA. On that application, Respondent
failed to acknowledge that he had been convicted of a crime in connection with controlled substances.

On December 13, 1993, Respondent requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was
placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was scheduled
for June 9, 1994. On June 3, 1994, Government counsel filed a motion for summary disposition alleging that Respondent
was without state authority to handle controlled substances.

In support of its motion, Government counsel produced a copy of the decision of the Division of Medical Quality, Medical
Board of California (Board) dated November 16, 1993. Paragraph two of the decision provides that Respondent shall
surrender his DEA Certificate of Registration and not reapply for a new DEA permit ``without prior written consent
of the [Board].'' Government counsel also attached to its motion a statement from a Board Probation Officer who indicated
that Respondent had not obtained written consent from the Board to reapply for his DEA Certificate.

On June 20, 1994, Respondent filed a letter which was treated by the administrative law judge as a cross-motion for
summary disposition. Respondent's submission, however, failed to address the issue of state authorization raised
in Government counsel's motion for summary disposition. The submission, rather, addressed the merits of the case.
Government counsel filed a response to Respondent's letter on June 23, 1994, again urging the administrative law
judge to revoke Respondent's registration and deny his application based on lack of state authorization.

On June 29, 1994, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended
that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked and that pending applications be denied. No exceptions
were filed and on August 2, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator.
The Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67.

It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized
to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business. 

See

 21 U.S.C. 823(f). DEA has consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled
substances cannot be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration. 

See Ramon Pla, M.D.

, 51 FR 41168 (1986); 

George S. Heath, M.D.

, 51 FR 26610 (1986); 

Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S.

, 51 FR 23481 (1986).

Consequently, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's opinion and decision recommending
that Respondent's registration be revoked and his pending applications denied. This decision is appropriate in
light of Respondent's lack of authorization to handle controlled substances in the State of California. The Deputy
Administrator has determined that due to Respondent's lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances,
it is not necessary to address whether Respondent's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AR2526171, issued to Jovencio Raneses, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that all pending applications for
registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 31, 1994.

The procedures are basically the same as the previous procedure used for PYs 1993 and 1994. Current successful grantees
may receive waivers from competition, and all designations will be for a two-year grant. JTPA section 401 grantees
who are presently operating under Pub. L. 102-477, Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration
Act of 1992, must apply for redesignation under this procedure in order to maintain their service area designation
and eligibility for funds under this title, including any requests for a waiver under JTPA section 401(l).

Introduction: Scope and Purpose of Notice



Section 401 of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) authorizes programs to serve the employment and training needs
of Indians and Native Americans.

Requirements for these programs are set forth in the JTPA and in the regulations at 20 CFR Part 632. The specific organization
eligibility and application requirements for designation are set forth at 20 CFR 632.10 and 632.11. Pursuant to these
requirements, the Department of Labor (DOL) selects entities for funding under section 401. It designates such entities
as potential Native American section 401 grantees which will be awarded grant funds contingent upon all other grant
award requirements being met. This notice describes how DOL will designate potential grantees who may apply for grants
for Program Years 1995 and 1996. A designated entity may apply for grant funds for PY 1995 and PY 1996 without further
competition.

The designation process has two parts. The Advance Notice of Intent (see Part III, below) is optional although strongly
recommended. The final Notice of Intent (see Part IV, below) is mandatory for all applicants. Any organization interested
in being designated as a Native American section 401 grantee should be aware of and comply with the procedures in these
parts.

The amount of JTPA section 401 funds to be awarded to designated Native American section 401 grantees is determined
under procedures described at 20 CFR 632.171 and not through this designation process. The grant application process
is described at 20 CFR 632.18 through 632.20.



I. General Designation Principles


Based on JTPA and applicable regulations, the following general principles are intrinsic to the designation process:

(1) All applicants for designation shall comply with the requirements found at 20 CFR Part 632, Subpart B, regardless
of their apparent standing in the preferential hierarchy (see Part V, Preferential Hierarchy For Determining Designations,
below). The basic eligibility, application and designation requirements are found in 20 CFR Part 632, Subpart B.

(2) The nature of this program is such that Indians and Native Americans in an area are entitled to program services
and are best served by a responsible organization directly representing them and designated pursuant to the applicable
regulations. The JTPA and the governing regulations give clear preference to Native American-controlled organizations.
That preference is the basis for the steps which will be followed in designating grantees.

(3) A State or federally recognized tribe, band or group 

on its reservation

 is given absolute preference over any other organization if it has the capability to administer the program and meets
all regulatory requirements. This preference applies only to the area within the reservation boundaries. Such ``reservation''
organization which may have its service area given to another organization will be given a future opportunity to reestablish
itself as the ``preference'' grantee.

In the event that such a tribe, band or group (including an Alaskan Native entity) is not designated to serve its reservation
or geographic service area, the DOL will consult with the governing body of such entities when designating alternative
service deliverers, as provided at 20 CFR 632.10(e). Such consultation may be accomplished in writing, in person,
or by telephone, as time and circumstances permit. When it is necessary to select alternative service deliveries,
the Grant Officer will continue to utilize input and recommendations from the Division of Indian and Native American
Programs (DINAP).

(4) In designating Native American section 401 grantees for off-reservation areas, DOL will provide preference
to Indian and Native American-controlled organizations as described in 20 CFR 632.10(f) and as further clarified
in Part IX (1) 

Indian or Native American-Controlled Organization

 of this notice. As noted in (3) above, when vacancies occur, the Grant Officer will continue to utilize input and recommendations
from DINAP when designating alternative service deliverers.

(5) Incumbent and non-incumbent applicants not granted waivers or seeking additional areas must submit evidence
of significant support from other Native American-controlled organizations within the communities (geographic
service areas) which they are currently serving or requesting to serve. See Part IV, Notice of Intent, below, for more
details.

(6) The Grant Officer will make the designations using a two-part process:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-2-00167 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Those applicants described in Part V (1) of the Preferential Hierarchy For Determining Designations will be designated
on a noncompetitive basis 

if

 all preaward clearances, responsibility reviews, and regulatory requirements are met.
(b) All applicants described in Part V, (2), (3), and (4) of the Preferential Hierarchy For Determining Designations
will be 

considered on a competitive basis

 for such areas, unless a waiver is granted, and only information submitted with the Notice of Intent, as well as preaward
clearances, responsibility reviews, and all regulatory requirements will be considered.
(7) Special employment and training services for Indian and Native American people have been provided through an
established service delivery network for the past 18 years under the authority of JTPA section 401 and its predecessor,
section 302 of the repealed Comprehensive employment and Training Act (CETA). The DOL intends to exercise its designation
authority to preserve the continuity of such services and to prevent the undue fragmentation of existing geographic
service areas. Consistent with the present regulations and other provisions of this notice, this will include preference
for those Native American organizations with an existing capability to deliver employment and training services
within an established geographic service area. Such preference will be determined through input and recommendations
from the Chief of DOL's Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP) and the Director of DOL's Office of
Special Targeted Programs (OSTP), and through the use of the rating system described in this Notice. Unless a non-incumbent
applicant in the same preferential hierarchy as an incumbent applicant grantee can demonstrate that it is significantly
superior overall to the incumbent, the incumbent will be designated, if it otherwise meets all of the requirements
for redesignation.
(8) In preparing application for designation, applicants should bear in mind that the purpose of JTPA, as amended,
is ``to establish programs to prepare youth and adults facing serious barriers to employment for participation in
the labor force by providing job training and other services that will result in increased employment and earnings,
increased education and occupational skills, and decreased welfare dependency, thereby improving the quality
of the work force and enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation.''


II. Waiver Provision


In accordance with the JTPA Amendments of 1992, section 401(1) (designation to receive a 2-year grant) states:



The competition for grants under this section shall be conducted every 2 years, except that if a recipient of such a
grant has performed satisfactorily under the terms of the existing grant agreement, the Secretary may waive the requirement
for such competition on receipt from the recipient of a satisfactory 2-year program plan for the succeeding 2-year
grant period.



The Department is implementing this waiver provision for the next two-year designation period (PY 1995-96).
All incumbent grantees who have performed ``satisfactorily'' both programmatically and administratively under
their present grant may receive a waiver for the next two-year designation period. The responsibility review criteria
at 20 CFR 632.11(d) of the current regulations serves as the baseline instrument to determine ``satisfactory'' performance.
A waiver may be requested by submitting an Advance Notice of Intent (ANOI) by October 15, 1994. A list of grantees granted
waivers will be published no later than November 15, 1994. Grantees, including tribes serving areas in addition to
their reservations, NOT meeting the waiver requirements set forth in the above paragraph will be subject to the competitive
process published in this solicitation.
Incumbent grantees receiving a waiver will be required to submit only a Standard Form (SF) 424 ``Application for Federal
Assistance'' for currently designated service area(s) by January 1, 1995.
Nonincumbent applicants who qualify for Preferential Hierarchy Status 1 may apply by January 1, 1995 for and may be
designated to serve their Hierarchy 1 service area(s).
Tribes and organizations participating in the employment and training demonstration project under Pub. L. 102-477
qualify for waiver consideration.
This is an initial approach to the waiver process. It is subject to change in the future resulting from experience and
the Department's desire to make the process equitable.


III. Advance Notice of Intent


The purpose of the Advance Notice of Intent process is to provide section 401 applicants, prior to the submission of
a final Notice of Intent, with information relative to potential competition. While DOL encourages the resolution
of competitive request at the local level prior to final submission, the Advance Notice of Intent process also serves
to alert those whose differences cannot be resolved of the need to submit a compete final Notice of Intent.
Although the Advance Notice of Intent process is not mandated by the regulations, participation in the advance process
by prospective section 401 applicants is strongly recommended. The Advance Notice of Intent process allows the applicant
to identify potential incumbent and non-incumbent competitors, to resolve conflicts if possible and to prepare
a final Notice of Intent with advance knowledge of potential competing requests.
It should be emphasized, however, that the Advance Notice of Intent process does not ensure that all potential competitors
have been identified. Some applicants may opt not to submit an Advance Notice of Intent; others may change geographic
service area request in the final Notice of Intent. Therefore, as noted above, final submissions should be prepared
with these possibilities in mind, unless a waiver has been granted. Although the regulations permit incumbents to
submit no more than a Standard Form 424 ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (SF 424) for their existing geographic
service areas, this choice may not be in the incumbent's best interests in the event of unanticipated competition.

<TEXT>
 

The SF 424 is not to be used for the advance notification process. As in the PY 1993-1994 designation process,
DOL will utilize the Advance Notice of Intent to expedite the identification of potentially competitive applicants
in situations where waivers have NOT been granted.

All organizations interested in being designated as section 401 grantees should submit an original and two copies
of an Advance Notice of Intent. The Advance Notice is to be postmarked no later than October 15, 1994, or 15 calendar
days after the date of publication of this 

Federal Register

 Notice. An organization may submit only one Advance Notice of Intent for any and all areas for which it wants to be considered.
The Advance Notice of Intent is to be sent to the Chief, Division of Indian and Native American Programs, at the address
cited above.

Complete instructions for the Advance Notice of Intent process will be mailed to all current grantees on or about October
1, 1994. Incumbents will also receive a description of their present geographic service area at this time. New applicants
may request copies of the Advance Notice of Intent instructions by writing to the Chief, Division of Indian and Native
American Programs, at the address cited above.

DOL's first step in the designation process is to determine which areas have more than one potential applicant for
designation, and whether any waivers have been granted. For those areas for which more than one organization submits
an Advance Notice of Intent, each such organization will be notified of the situation, and will be apprised of the identity
of the other organization(s) applying for that area. Such notification will consist of providing affected applicants
(including incumbents who have not submitted Advance Notices of Intent) with copies of all Advance Notices submitted
for their requested areas. The notification will state that organizations are encouraged to work out any conflicting
requests among themselves, and that a final Notice of Intent should be submitted by the required postmark of January
1, 1995, deadline (see Part IV, Notice of Intent, below).


Under the Advance Notice of Intent process, it is DOL policy that, to the extent possible within the regulations, a
geographic service area and the applicant that will operate a section 401 program in that area are to be determined
by the Native American community to be served by the program. In the event the Native American community cannot resolve
differences, applicants should take special care with their final Notices of Intent to ensure that they are complete
and fully responsive to all matters covered by the preferential hierarchy and rating systems discussed in this notice.




Information provided in the Advance Notice of Intent process shall not be considered as a final submission as referenced
at 20 CFR 632.11. The Advance Notice of Intent is a procedural mechanism to facilitate the designation process. The
regulations do not provide for formal application for designation through the Advance Notice of Intent.

IV. Notice of Intent


Even though an ANOI has been submitted, all applicants must submit an original and two copies of a final Notice of Intent,
postmarked not later than January 1, 1995, consistent with the regulations at 20 CFR 632.11. Final Notices of Intent
may also be delivered in person not later than the close of business on the first business day of the designation year.
Exclusive of charts of graphs and letters or support, the Notice of Intent should not exceed 

75

 pages of double-space unreduced type.
Final Notice of Intent are to be sent to the Chief, Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP), at the address
cited above.


Final Notice of Intent Contents:

 (as outlined at 20 CFR 632.11)
 A completed and signed SF-424, ``Application for Federal Assistance'';
 An indication of the applicant's legal status, including articles of incorporation or consortium agreement
as appropriate;
 A clear indication of the territory being applied for, in the same format as the ANOI;
 Evidence of community support from Native American-controlled organizations; and
 Other relevant information relating to capability, such as service plans and previous experience which the
applicant feels will strengthen its case, including information on any unresolved or outstanding administrative
problems.
Final Notice of Intent must contain evidence of community support. Incumbent and non-incumbent State and Federally-recognized
tribes need not submit such evidence regarding their own reservations. However, such entities are required to provide
such evidence for any area which they wish to serve beyond their reservation boundaries.
The regulations permit current grantees requesting their existing geographic service areas to submit an SF 424 in
lieu of a complete application, whether or not a waiver has been granted. As noted earlier in this notice, current grantees,
other than tribes, bands or groups (including Alaskan Native entities) requesting their existing areas and NOT granted
a waiver, are encouraged to consider submitting a full Notice of Intent (even if their geographic service area request
has not changed) in the event that competition occurs. Tribes, bands or groups (including Alaskan Native entities)
should consider submitting a full Notice of Intent if they currently serve areas beyond their reservation boundaries
and have NOT been granted a waiver for these areas.
Applicants are encouraged to modify the geographic service area requests identified in their Advance Notice of Intent
to avoid competition with other applicants. Applicants should not add territory to the geographic service area requests
identified in the Advance Notice of Intent. Any organization applying by January 1, 1995, for non-contiguous geographic
service areas shall prepare a separate, complete Notice of Intent for each such area unless currently designated
for such areas.
It is DOL's policy that no information affecting the panel review process will be solicited or accepted past the regulatory
postmarked or hand delivered deadlines (see Part VI, Use of Panel Review Procedure, below). All information provided
before the deadline must be in writing.
This policy does not preclude the Grant Officer from requesting additional information independent of the panel
review process.


V. Preferential Hierarchy for Determining Designation


In cases in which only one organization is applying for a clearly identified geographic service area and the organization
meets the requirements at 20 CFR 632.10(b) and 632.11(d), DOL shall designate the applying organization as the grantee
for the area. In cases in which two or more organizations apply for the same area (in whole or in part), and no waivers
have been granted, DOL will utilize the order of designation preference described in the hierarchy below. The organization
will be designated, assuming all other requirements are met. The preferential hierarchy is:
(1) Indian tribes, bands or groups on Federal or State reservations for their reservation; Oklahoma Indians only
as specified in Part VIII, Special Designation Situations, below; and Alaskan Native entities only specified in
Part VIII, Special Designation Situations, below.
(2) Native American-controlled, community-based organizations as defined in Part IX (1) of the glossary in this
notice, with significant support from other Native American-controlled organizations within the service community.
This includes tribes applying for geographic service areas other than their own reservations.
When a non-incumbent can demonstrate in its application, by verifiable information, that it is potentially significantly
superior overall to the incumbent, and the incumbent has not been granted a waiver, a formal competitive process will
be utilized which may include a panel review. Such potential will be determined by the consideration of such factors
a the following: completeness of the application and quality of the contents; documentation of past experience,
Native American-controlled organizational support; understanding of area training and employment needs and approach
to addressing such needs; and the capability of the incumbent. If there is no incumbent, and therefore no waivers granted,
new applicants qualified for this category would complete against each other.
(3) Organizations (private nonprofit or units of State or local governments) having a significant Native American
advisory process, such as a governing body chaired by a Native American and having a majority membership of Native
Americans.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Non-Native American-controlled organizations without a Native American advisory process. In the event such
an organization is designated, it must develop a Native American advisory process as a condition for the award of a
grant.

The Chief, DINAP, will make determinations regarding hierarchy, geographic service areas, eligibility of new applicants
and the timeliness of submissions. He may convene a task force to assist in making such determinations. The role of
the task force is that of a technical advisory body.

The Chief, DINAP, will ultimately advise the Grant Officer in reference to which position an organization holds in
the designation hierarchy. Within the regulatory time constraints of the designated process, the Chief, DINAP,
will utilize whatever information is available.



The applying organization must supply sufficient information to permit the determination to be made. Organizations
must indicate the category which they assume is appropriate and must adequately support that assertion.



VI. Use of Panel Review Procedure



A formal competitive process may be utilized under the following circumstances:

(1) The Chief, DINAP, advises that a new applicant qualified for the second category of the hierarchy appears to be
potentially significantly superior overall to an incumbent Native American-controlled, community-based organization
with significant local Native American community support, and the incumbent has not been granted a waiver.

(2) The Chief, DINAP, advises that more than one new applicant is qualified for the second category of the hierarchy,
and the incumbent grantee has not reapplied for designation.

(3) The Chief, DINAP, advises that two or more organizations have equal status in the third or fourth categories of
the hierarchy, when there are no applicants qualified for the first and second categories, and no waivers have been
granted.

When competition occurs, the Grant Officer may convene a review panel of Federal Officials to score the information
submitted with the Notice of Intent. The purpose of the panel is to evaluate an organization's capability, based on
its application,

 to serve the area in question. The panel will be provided only the information described at 20 CFR 632.11 and submitted
with the final Notice of Intent. The panel will not give weight to simple assertions. Any information must be supported
by adequate and verifiable documentation, 

e.g.,

 supporting references must contain the name of the contact person, an address and telephone number.

The factors listed below will be considered in evaluating the capability of the applicant. In developing the Notice
of Intent, the applicant should organize his documentation of capability to correspond with these factors.

(1) Operational Capability_40 points. (20 CFR 632.10 and 632.11)

(a) Previous experience in successfully operating an employment and training program serving Indians and Native
Americans of a scope comparable to that which the organization would operate if designated_20 points.

(b) Previous experience in operating other human resources development programs serving Indians or Native Americans
or coordinating employment and training services with such programs_10 points.

(c) Ability to maintain continuity of services to Indian or Native American participants with those previously provided
under JTPA_10 points.

(2) Identification of the training and employment problems and needs in the requested area and approach to addressing
such problems and needs_20 points. (20 CFR 632.2)

(3) Planning Process_20 points (20 CFR 632.11)

(a) Private sector involvement_10 points.

(b) Community support as defined in Part IX (1), Designation Process Glossary, and documentation as provided in Part
I (5), General Designation Principles_10 points.

(4) Administrative Capability_20 points. (20 CFR 632.11)

(a) Previous experience in administering public funds under DOL or similar administrative requirements_15 points.

(b) Experience of senior management staff to be responsible for a DOL grant_5 points.

VII. Notification of Designation/Nondesignation



The Grant Officer will make the final designation decision giving consideration to the following factors: the review
panel's recommendation, in those instances where a panel is convened; input from DINAP, the Office of Special Targeted
Programs, the DOL Employment and Training Administration's Office of Grant and Contracts Management and Office
of Management Services, and the DOL Office of the Inspector General; and any other available information regarding
the organization's financial and operational capability, and responsibility. The Grant Officer's decisions will
be provided to all applicants by March 1, 1995, as follows:

(1) 

Designation Letter.

 The designation letter signed by the Grant Officer will serve as official notice of an organization's designation.
The letter will include the geographic service area for which the designation is made. It should be noted that the Grant
Officer is not required to adhere to the geographical service area requested in the Final Notice of Intent. The Grant
Officer may make the designation applicable to all of the area requested, a portion of the area requested, or if acceptable
to the designee, more than the area requested.

(2) 

Conditional Designation Letter.

 Conditional designations will include the nature of the conditions, the actions required to be finally designated
and the time frame for such actions to be accomplished.

(3) 

Nondesignation Letter.

 Any organization not designated, in whole or in part, for a geographic service area requested will be notified formally
of the Nondesignation and given the basic reasons for the determination. An applicant for designation that is refused
such designation, in whole or in part, may file a Petition for Reconsideration in accordance with 20 CFR 632.13, and
subsequently, may appeal the Nondesignation to an administrative law judge under the provisions of 20 CFR Part 636.

If an area is not designated for service through the foregoing process, alternative arrangements for service will
be made in accordance with 20 CFR 632.12.



VIII. Special Designation Situations



(1) 

Alaskan Native Entities.

 DOL has established geographic service areas for Alaskan Native employment and training based on the following:
(a) The boundaries of the regions defined in the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA); (b) the boundaries
of major subregional areas where the primary provider of human resource development related services is an Indian
Reorganization Act (IRA)-recongnized tribal council, and (c) the boundaries of one Federal reservation in the State.
Within these established geographic service areas, DOL will designate the primary Alaskan Native-controlled human
resource development services provider or an entity formally designated by such provider. In the past, these entities
have been regional nonprofit corporations, IRA-recognized tribal councils and the tribal government of the Metlakatla
Indian Community. DOL intends to follow these principles in designating Native American Grantees in Alaska for Program
Years 1995 and 1996.

(2) 

Oklahoma Indians.

 DOL has established a service delivery system for Indian employment and training programs in Oklahoma based on a preference
for Oklahoma Indians to serve portions of the State. Generally, geographic service areas have been designated geographically
as countywide areas. In cases in which a significant portion of the land area of an individual county lies within traditional
jurisdiction of more than one tribal government, the service area has been subdivided to a certain extent on the basis
of tribal identification information in the most recent Federal Decennial Census of Population. Wherever possible,
arrangements mutually satisfactory to grantees in adjoining or overlapping geographic service areas have been
honored by DOL. DOL intends to follow these principles in designating Native American grantees in Oklahoma for Program
Years 1995 and 1996 to preserve continuity and prevent unnecessary fragmentation.



IX. Designation Process Glossary



In order to ensure that all interested parties have the same understanding of the process, the following definitions
are provided:

(1) 

Indian or Native American-Controlled Organization.

 This is defined as any organization with a governing board, more than 50 percent of whose members are Indians or Native
Americans. Such an organization can be a tribal government, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian entity, consortium,
or public or private nonprofit agency. For the purpose of hierarchy determinations, the governing board must have
decision-making authority for the section 401 program.

(2) 

Service Area.

 This is defined as the geographic area described as States, counties, and/or reservations for which a designation
is made. In some cases, it will also show the specific population to be served. The service area is defined by the Grant
Officer in the formal designation letter. Grantees must ensure that all eligible population members have equitable
access to employment and training services within the service area.

(3) 

Community Support.

 This is evidence of active participation and/or endorsement from Indian or Native American-controlled organizations
within the geographic service area for which designation is requested.

While applicants are not precluded from submitting attestations of support from individuals, the business community,
State and local government offices, and community organizations that are not Indian or Native American-controlled,
they should be aware that such endorsements do not meet DOL's definitional criteria for community support.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedures thereon prior to the issuance of
these determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed
in that section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and
in large volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under the Davis-
Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of comment period; close of record. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recently supplemented the record concerning the notices addressing
changes to the Federal respirable dust program for coal mines. The mining community has requested additional time
to review this information and to prepare their comments. MSHA is extending the period for the public to submit post-hearing
comments on the February 18, 1994, notices which address: (1) The use of single, full-shift respirable dust measurements
to determine noncompliance under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program; and (2) the joint finding by the Secretary
of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the average concentration of respirable dust to which
each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be measured accurately over a single shift. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 1, 1994, (59 FR 38988), MSHA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 extending the time for post-hearing comments on the February 18, 1994, notices (59 FR 8356 and 8357), from August 5,
1994 to September 30, 1994. 



In that notice, MSHA also stated that based on comments received at the public hearings held in July 1994, (59 FR 29348
and 59 FR 34868), and in response to specific requests, the Agency would supplement the record with additional information.
On September 9, 1994, the Agency added several documents to the record. This additional information does not in any
way change the proposed findings. Commenters have requested additional time to review this information. 

Therefore, the Agency is extending the post-hearing comment period until November 30, 1994. Interested parties
are encouraged to submit their comments on or before that date.

<DOCTITLE>Petitions for Modification </DOCTITLE>



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 



1. Triton Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-136-C] 



Triton Coal Company, P.O. Box 3027, Gillette, Wyoming 82717-3027 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 77.1607(u) (loading and haulage equipment; operation) to its Buckskin Mine (I.D. No. 48-01200) located
in Campbell County, Wyoming. The petitioner requests a variance from the mandatory standard for towing of haul trucks
and other large off highway surface mine equipment. The petitioner proposes to use a portable hydraulic unit to supply
power to the necessary functions of disabled equipment in order to move it safely. The petitioner states that proper
training would be provided to every miner responsible for using this equipment. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternative method would provide at 
least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



2. Rosebud Mining Company 



[Docket No. M-94-137-C] 



Rosebud Mining Company, Box 324B, R.D. 2, Parker, Pennsylvania 16049 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.333(b)(2) (ventilation controls) to its Rosebud No. 3 Mine (I.D. No. 36-07843) located in Armstrong
County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory standard to permit the use of temporary
ventilation controls in the room necking procedure for rooms developed less than 600 feet. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.




3. Ram Head Coal Company 



[Docket No. M-94-138-C] 



Ram Head Coal Company, 277 Main Street, Joliet, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36-08454) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. Because of steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage
slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternate,
when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor
and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the
main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same
measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



4. Independent Aggregates 



[Docket No. M-94-38-M] 



Independent Aggregates, P.O. Box 519, Inglis, Florida 34449 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
57.6306(b) (loading and blasting) to its I.A.C. Mine (I.D. No. 08-01035) located in Citrus County, Florida.
The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory standard to permit the drill to continue drilling the shot
pattern while loading is in progress. The petitioner proposes to complete a drill hole and immediately load the hole
while drilling new holes continues. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at
least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



5. Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc. 



[Docket No. M-94-39-M] 



Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc., P.O. Box 6920, Cleveland, Ohio 44101 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
57.19000(c) (personnel hoisting; application) to its Cleveland Mine (I.D. No. 33-01994) located in Cuyahoga
County, Ohio. The petitioner requests a variance from the mandatory standard to permit the use of an approved escape
hoist as a secondary escape hoist for persons underground, while upgrading its production hoist to increase its hoisting
capability. The petitioner states that the escape hoisting equipment is capable of hoisting out 70 people in one hour;
that working schedules would be modified to ensure that only 70 people would be underground when the escape hoist is
in operation; and that a hoist operator would be available at all times while personnel are underground. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard. 



Request for Comments 



Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments. These comments must be filed with the Office
of Standards, Regulations and Variances, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Room 627, 4015 Wilson Boulevard,

Proposed Exemption



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections

(E) The Repayments shall not exceed the amounts actually received by the Plans under the Rehab Plan; and 

(F) Repayment of the Loan shall be waived to the extent that the amount of the Loan exceeds the amount of cash recovered
by the Plans under the Rehab Plan. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. The Employer is a New York corporation engaged in the business of processing and marketing canned vegetables and
fruit, with its corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Employer is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Del Monte Foods Company (DMFC), a Maryland corporation. On behalf of its employees and those of its affiliates,
the Employer sponsors both of the Plans, which are defined contribution pension plans providing for individual participant
accounts (the Accounts) and participant-directed investment of the Accounts. As of December 31, 1993, the Plans
had approximately 3,730 participants. 

2. The Plans' assets are held in a master trust (the Master Trust) of which the trustee is the Merrill Lynch Trust Company
of California (the Trustee). The named fiduciary of each Plan is the Del Monte Investment Committee (the Committee),
which consists of five employees of the Employer appointed by the Employer's board of directors. The Committee designates
the investment options into which the Plans' participants may direct the investment of their Accounts. The Plans
currently offer five investment options, one of which is the Interest Income Fund (the I Fund), which invests in, among
other things, guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies. As of December 31, 1993, the I Fund
represented approximately 54 percent of the fair market value of the assets of the Master Trust. The assets of the I
Fund include guaranteed investment contract No. CG01300B3A (the GIC). The GIC was issued to the Plans on or about December
1, 1990 by Executive Life Insurance Company of California (Executive Life) as part of an arrangement whereby Executive
Life agreed to ``clone'' a contract previously held by the Plans' predecessor plans (the Predecessor Plans), in connection
with the sale of the Employer to DMFC in 1990 and the Employer's agreement that the Plans would assume the assets and
liabilities of the Predecessor Plans. The GIC is a benefit-responsive contract permitting withdrawals for plan
benefits, loans, and participant-directed reallocations among investment options under the Plans, and was issued
in the principal amount of $3,899,130.43, with a guaranteed simple annual interest rate of 9.22 percent (the Contract
Rate) to the July 1, 1993 maturity date.

The Committee has designated Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc. (MLAM) as the investment manager for the I Fund.
MLAM and the Trustee are both subsidiaries of Merrill Lynch & Co. In accordance with investment guidelines provided
by the Committee, MLAM generally invests and manages the I Fund's assets, which consist of Plan contributions, participant
reallocations of Account balances to the I Fund, and proceeds of maturing investments. MLAM represents that it is
not an investment manager within the meaning of Section 3(38) of the Act with respect to any ``cloned'' contracts,
including the GIC, which were issued to the Plans as part of the asset transfer from the Predecessor Plans.

1

 





3. On April 11, 1991 (the Conservation Date), Executive Life was placed in conservatorship by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of California.

2

 As of that date, payments under the GIC were suspended, and no withdrawals or payments from the GIC have been made since
the Conservation Date. As of the Conservation Date, the GIC had a book value of $3,766,668, representing total principal
deposits under the GIC plus accrued interest at the Contract Rate less previous withdrawals, and constituting approximately
2.4 percent of the assets of the I Fund at that time. Effective April 30, 1991, the Committee froze a proportionate share
of each of the 2,918 Accounts invested in the I Fund. With respect to the frozen portion of each Account, the Committee
has prohibited the crediting of earnings, the making of distributions, withdrawals and loans, and the reallocation
of the frozen Account portions to other investment options of the Plans. Printed Account statements provided to the
Plans participants have reported the frozen Account portions separately, indicating the frozen status. 




4. In September 1993, the Employer entered into a written agreement for the sale of substantially all the assets of
one of the Employer's business units to Silgan Containers Corporation (Silgan). Pursuant to that agreement, the
Employer is required to transfer to one or more individual account plans maintained by Silgan (the Silgan Plans) the
assets and liabilities of the Plans with respect to the Accounts of the Plans' participants who transferred employment
from the Employer to Silgan as a result of the sale of the business unit. The parties agreed that the asset transfer is
to be made in cash. The asset transfer includes 288 Accounts which are subject to the proportionate freeze resulting
from the Executive Life conservatorship. 


5. On August 13, 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court approved the terms of the Rehabilitation/Liquidation Plan for
Executive Life (the Rehab Plan) effective September 3, 1993. On or about December 29, 1993, each holder of an Executive
Life contract was provided with an election form and summary of the Rehab Plan. Under the Rehab Plan, Executive Life's
guaranteed investment contracts were reduced in value to approximately 79 percent of the book value as of the Conservation
Date (the Rehab Value), and each holder of such contracts was paid an amount (the Interim Payment) for accumulated
interest and fees for the period between the Conservation Date and September 3, 1993. Each contract holder, including
the Plans, was informed that each contract holder could elect by February 12, 1994 to ``opt in'' or ``opt out'' of the
Rehab Plan. The Employer represents that by ``opting in'', according to the Rehab Plan summary, a contract holder
would be issued a new 5-year contract issued by Aurora National Life Assurance Company, the successor of Executive
Life, in an amount equal to the Rehab Value less the amount of the Interim Payment, plus the right to receive possible
distributions (Residual Payments) from certain trusts and settlements which may occur in the liquidation of Executive
Life. The Employer states that, according to the Rehab Plan summary, ``opting out'' of the Rehab Plan results in a cash
settlement, consisting of an immediate cash payment (the Initial Payment), and the right to receive any Residual
Payments which become available. The Interim Payment was payable to all contract holders, whether they ``opt in''
or ``opt out'' of the Rehab Plan. 


6. The Employer states that after review and consideration of the Rehab Plan summary and the reports of outside consultants
retained for analysis and advice, the Committee determined that the Plans should ``opt out'' of the Rehab Plan. Accordingly,
the Plans received the Initial Payment on the GIC on March 31, 1994. When combined with the Interim Payment, the Plans
have received approximately 57 percent of the GIC's Conservation Date book value. The Employer states that the Residual
Payments potentially available to the Plans, as a contract holder which ``opts out'' of the Rehab Plan, will consist
of the net proceeds, if any, from the following: (a) An allocation holdback equal to approximately 11 percent of the
GIC's Conservation Date book value; (b) liquidation of three trusts established under the Rehab Plan to liquidate
Executive Life's non-investment grade securities and other assets, paid through an ``Opt-Out Trust''; and (c) remaining
proceeds from another trust established under the Rehab Plan to deal with bond indemnification obligations shared
by contract holders. The Employer states that the summary of the Rehab Plan reported that some Residual Payments may
be made annually but others could take a substantial period of time to realize. The Employer represents that under
the Rehab Plan, neither the timing nor the amount of any Residual Payments can be determined with certainty. However,
the Employer represents that on the basis of the Rehab Plan summary and the analysis conducted by consultants retained
to assist the Committee, the Committee estimates that the Plans will receive total Residual Payments of $1,073,500.30
(the Estimated Residuals), or about 28.5 percent of the GIC's book value as of the Conservation Date.

7. In order that the frozen portions of the Accounts may be released without the delay and uncertainty of awaiting the
Residual Payments, and in order to enable the transfer of assets from the Plans to the Silgan Plans, the Employer proposes
to loan the Plans the amount of the Estimated Residuals (the Loan), and is requesting an exemption to permit the Loan
under the terms and conditions described herein.

3

 The Loan, pursuant to a written agreement, will be made in a lump sum in the amount of the Estimated Residuals less any
Residual Payments which the Plans may have received prior to the Loan. The Loan will be made as soon as practicable after
the Committee has obtained the exemption proposed herein, if granted, and a closing agreement with respect thereto
has been consummated with the Internal Revenue Service. The repayment of the Loan (the Repayments) will be limited
to the cash proceeds, if any, received by the Plan as Residual Payments after the date of the Loan. Repayments are due
only as and when Residual Payments are received by the Plans. No interest will be paid on the Loan, and the Plans will
incur no expenses with respect to the Loan. Under no circumstances will the Repayments exceed the Loan. At such time
as the Trustee or Executive Life notifies the Employer that no further Residual Payments will be made, repayment of
any outstanding Loan amount will be waived by the Employer. 





8. If the proposed exemption is granted, the Committee intends to revalue the Plans' investment in the GIC (the Adjusted
Value) to equal the sum of the Initial Payment, the Interim Payment, the Loan, and any Residual Payments received prior
to the Loan. Each frozen Account will also be adjusted to reflect the Adjusted Value accordingly, reducing the Plans'
recorded investment in the GIC from the Conservation Date book value to the Adjusted Value, and a proportional percent
of each frozen Account will be recorded as a loss. After the Loan is made and the Accounts are adjusted, the Committee
will remove the freeze on the Accounts invested in the GIC and the Plans will resume distribution, withdrawals, loans
and interfund transfers with respect to Account portions previously subject to the freeze. Additionally, the Plans
will be able to complete the transfer of assets to the Silgan Plans, in accordance with the agreement of sale of the Employer's
business unit to Silgan, by transferring the previously frozen Account portions on the basis of the Adjusted Value
and by utilizing the cash made available by the Loan. 


9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (a) All terms and conditions of the Loan will be no less favorable to the Plans than
those which the Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) The Loan will enable
the Plans to resume normal operations with respect to the frozen portion of the Accounts; (c) The Loan will enable the
completion of the transfer of assets to the Silgan Plan with respect to 288 frozen Accounts; (d) No interest or expenses
will be paid by the Plans; (e) The Repayments will be restricted to the Residual Payments received by the Plans pursuant
to the Rehab Plan; (f) The Repayment will not exceed the Loan or the Residual Payments received after the Loan is made;
and (g) The Repayments will be waived to the extent the Loan exceeds Residual Payments received by the Plans after the
Loan is made.

Proposed Exemption


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed guarantees (the Guarantees) by the Xerox Corporation (the Employer),
the sponsor of the Plans, of amounts payable to the Plans by the Aurora National Life Assurance Company (Aurora) with
respect to five group annuity contracts (the GACs) originally issued by Executive Life Insurance Company of California
(Executive Life); provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) All terms and conditions of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could
obtain in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties;
(B) The Guarantees are made solely with respect to the amounts which are due the Plans, but unpaid, with respect to the
GACs; and
(C) The Settlement Agreement described in the Summary of Facts and Representations, below, is approved by the U.S.
District Court, District of Connecticut.


Summary of Facts and Representations




Introduction:

 In 1994, the Xerox Corporation and other defendants to certain litigation entered into a settlement agreement which
requires, among other things, that Xerox Corporation guarantee the Plans' receipt of certain payments in connection
with the rehabilitation of Executive Life Insurance Company of California. Xerox Corporation also has undertaken
to make a similar guarantee with respect to certain of the Plans' participants who were not parties to the litigation
settlement agreement. Xerox Corporation is requesting an exemption to permit these guarantees, under the terms
and conditions described herein.
1. Xerox Corporation (the Employer) is a publicly-held New York corporation engaged in the development, manufacture,
marketing, and servicing of document processing technology, with its corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
The Employer maintains various qualified employee benefit plans for its employees, including the Plans, the assets
of which are held in the Xerox Corporation Trust Agreement to Fund Retirement Plans (the Master Trust), which had total
assets of approximately $4.6 billion as of December 31, 1993. The Union PSP and the Union RIGP (the Union Plans) are
maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between the Employer and the Xerographic Division of the
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O. (the Union). The trustee of the Master Trust
is the State Street Bank and Trust Company of North Quincy, Massachusetts (the Trustee), serving as a directed trustee
according to directions of a delegee of a committee of representatives of the Employer's board of directors (the Committee).
The PSSP and the Union PSP are defined contribution plans (the DC Plans) which provide for individual participant
accounts and participant-directed investment of such accounts among investment options in the Master Trust (the
MT Funds). The RIGP and Union RIGP are hybrid defined benefit plans (the DB Plans) in which certain participants may
accrue benefits measured in part by reference to individual accounts consisting of contributions made on the participant's
behalf. The individual accounts of the DB Plans are invested among the MT Funds.

2. Included among the MT Funds as of April 1, 1991 was a guaranteed fund (the G Fund) which invested primarily in group
annuity and guaranteed investment contracts issued by various insurance companies. As of April 1, 1991, the G Fund
had approximately $65.6 million invested in group annuity contracts (the GACs) issued by Executive Life Insurance
Company of California (ELIC), representing approximately 7.5 percent of the assets in the G Fund as of that date. On
April 11, 1991, the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California (the Commissioner) ordered a conservatorship
(the Conservatorship) of ELIC, and halted all payments on ELIC's guaranteed contracts, including the GACs.

4

 The Employer represents that it took immediate protective action on behalf of the Plans' participants, by segregating
the G Fund assets attributable to the GACs in a new segregated fund (the Segregated Fund), effective April 1, 1991.
The account of each Plan participant with an interest in the G Fund as of April 1, 1991 was assigned an interest in the
Segregated Fund, in proportion to the GACs' total value as of April 1, 1991.

5

 The remaining G Fund assets were placed in a new fund designated as the Income Fund. The Plan was amended, effective
April 1, 1991, to prohibit distribution, withdrawal, and transfer of any account balance attributable to the Segregated
Fund.





3. The Employer represents that on September 3, 1993 the assets and restructured liabilities of ELIC were assigned
to Aurora Life National Assurance Company (Aurora), pursuant to the Commissioner's court-approved rehabilitation
plan (the Rehab Plan). Under the Rehab Plan, each ELIC contract holder was permitted to elect between (1) Opting in
to the Rehab Plan, in which case Aurora would assume the ELIC contract, or (2) opting out of the Rehab Plan, in which case
a cash settlement would be paid in exchange for the ELIC contract. A determination was made by a delegee of the Committee
that the Plans would elect to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the appropriate opt-out election forms were completed by
the Trustee. Subsequently, the Plans received $37.9 million (the Initial Recovery), approximately 58 percent of
the Segregated Fund, as part of the Rehab Plan's provisions for ELIC contract holders who opted out of the Rehab Plan.
The Employer represents that the Commissioner has estimated that such holders of ELIC contracts can expect to recover
a total of about 85 percent of the Conservatorship Date value of the contracts. Accordingly, the Employer states that
the Plans can expect to recover from Aurora another $17.8 million on the contracts, approximately 27 percent of the
Segregated Fund, over the remaining estimated four years of the Rehab Plan's operation.
4. However, on April 6, 1992, a class action (the 1992 Litigation) was commenced on behalf of affected participants
and beneficiaries of the RIGP and PSSP (the Plaintiffs) against the Employer and members of the Committee (collectively,
the Defendants), 

Maureen Rose, et al.,

 v. 

Joan Ganz Cooney, et al.,

 Civil Action No. 5:92-CV-208, Federal District Court, District of Connecticut (the Court). The Plaintiffs
alleged that the Defendants' actions in connection with the Plans' purchase of the GACs violated various provisions
of the Act. On July 15, 1994, Plaintiffs and Defendants executed an agreement in settlement of the 1992 Litigation
(the Agreement), which provides as follows:
(A) Defendants are to make an initial cash payment of $13 million to an interest-bearing escrow account (the Escrow).
Amounts in the Escrow, including interest, less attorney's fees and administrative costs approved by the Court,
are to be transferred to the Master Trust for the benefit of Plaintiffs no sooner than 10 days after the Court enters
a final order approving the Agreement, but only if the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are approved by
the Department, in the exemption proposed herein, and by the Internal Revenue Service (the Service). The Employer
represents that it is expected that the Escrow payment to the Master Trust on behalf of Plaintiffs, after payment of
costs and fees, will be approximately $9 million, or about 15 percent of the Plaintiff's account balances in the Segregated
Fund.

(B) In the event that payments after June 3, 1994, and before January 1, 1999, from Aurora (and any other source related
to the rehabilitation of ELIC, other than any state insurance guaranty associations) to the Master Trust for the benefit
of Plaintiffs with respect to the GACs are less than $16.1 million, approximately 27 percent of the Plaintiffs' account
balances in the Segregated Fund, then the Employer shall pay the difference to the Master Trust on or before January
31, 1999. This undertaking by the Employer is referred to herein as the Settlement Guarantee. The Employer requests
an exemption to permit the Settlement Guarantee under the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this proposed
exemption. 

Each Plaintiff will have a pro rata share of the amounts paid under the Agreement in proportion to the Plaintiff's account's
share of the Segregated Fund. The Employer represents that when added to the amounts already received from Aurora,
the Employer's payments under the Agreement are expected to ensure that Plaintiffs will recover 100 percent of their
account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Agreement, after approval by the Court, will be in full satisfaction
of all claims of Plaintiffs arising out of the subject matter of the 1992 Litigation, and the 1992 Litigation will be
dismissed with prejudice. The Agreement will be effective only if approved by the Court and only if the Employer obtains
the exemption proposed herein by the Department and a favorable ruling on the Agreement by the Service. The Employer
represents that the Court entered a preliminary approval of the Agreement on July 22, 1994, and rendered its final
approval of the Agreement in a hearing on September 8, 1994.

5. Participants in the Union Plans were not parties to the 1992 Litigation. The Employer represents that since 1991,
the Union has demanded that the Union Plans' participants with rights in the GACs (the Union Participants) be made
whole for their losses on the GACs. On June 9, 1994, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Trustee (the 1994 Litigation)
on behalf of the Plaintiffs in the 1992 Litigation and the Union Participants, alleging that the Trutees' actions
in connection with the Plans' purchase of the GACs violated various provisions of the Act. Although the proposed Agreement
will provide that the 1994 Litigation be dismissed with prejudice as to the 1992 Litigation Plaintiffs, it will provide
that the 1994 Litigation be dismissed without prejudice as to the Union Participants. The terms of the Agreement do
not require any payments by the Employer to the Segregated Fund on behalf of the Union Participants. In response to
ongoing demands on behalf of the Union Participants, the Employer has agreed to make payments to the Master Trust with
respect to the Union Participants in a manner similar to the Agreement's provisions for the 1992 Litigation Plaintiffs.
Specifically, the Employer will make an initial cash payment to the Master Trust on behalf of the Union Participants
equal to 15 percent of the Segregated Fund account balances of the Union Participants. The Employer also guarantees
to make additional payments to the extent that amounts received by the Master Trust from Aurora for the benefit of Union
Participants after June 3, 1994 and before January 1, 1999 are less than $1.8 million, or 27 percent of the Union Participants'
account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Employer's guarantee to make such additional payments (the Union Guarantee)
is included in the Guarantees for which the Employer requests an exemption, under the terms and conditions of the exemption
proposed herein.

7

 The Employer represents that, when added to amounts already received from Aurora, the initial payments and contingent
additional payments by the Employer pursuant to the Union Guarantee will ensure that the Union Participants recover
100 percent of their account balances in the Segregated Fund. The Employer's initial and contingent additional payments
to the Union Participants are conditioned upon the grant of the exemption proposed herein and a favorable ruling by
the Service. 





8. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Guarantees will protect the Plans participants and beneficiaries from
losses on the GACs' value as of the commencement of the ELIC conservatorship; (b) The Guarantees will eliminate uncertainty
with respect to the value of the GACs in the Segregated Fund; (c) The Settlement Guarantee will enable the settlement
of Plaintiffs claims arising from the 1992 Litigation and the 1994 Litigation; and (d) the Union Guarantee will extend
to the Union Participants the same protections with respect to the GACs as those extended to the Plaintiffs under the
Settlement Guarantee.

Vaquero Farms, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and Agri-Bis, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the Plans) Located in Stockton, California




[Application Nos. D-9711 and D-9712] 



Proposed Exemption
 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code shall not apply to the past cash sale (the Sale) by the Plans of certain promissory notes (the Notes) to
Vaquero Farms, Inc. (the Applicant) and Agri-Bis, Inc., a related company, provided that the following conditions
were met at the time of the Sale: (1) The sales price of the Notes was not less than their aggregate fair market value on
the date of the Sale; (2) the Sale was a one-time transaction for cash; (3) the Plans did not pay any fees or commissions
in connection with the Sale; and (4) the Plans' independent fiduciary determined that the transaction was appropriate
for and in the best interests of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries.

3. On May 31, 1994, the Applicant purchased the Notes from the Plans for their full face value, plus interest at the rate
provided in the Notes, through the date of purchase.

9

 The actual purchase price for each of the Notes was $269,823.91. The Applicant represents that the transaction was
designed to protect the Plans' participants and beneficiaries from losses which would have resulted from the foreclosure
of senior lienholders on the real property which secured the Plans' loans to Triad. The Applicant represents that
it was necessary to purchase the Notes from the Plans prior to receiving an individual exemption for the transaction
because foreclosure was imminent and the Notes would have been worthless to the Applicants if foreclosure had occurred
prior to the purchase of the Notes. 





4. Howard L. Seligman, an attorney licensed to practice in the State of California and a partner in the firm of Seligman
and Willet, Inc., has agreed to serve as an independent fiduciary (the Independent Fiduciary) in connection with
the transaction. The Independent Fiduciary has acknowledged his status as an ERISA fiduciary and represents that
he understands and accepts his fiduciary duties, responsibilities and potential liabilities. The Independent
Fiduciary maintains that he has no pre-existing business relationship with the Applicant or Agri-Bis, Inc. He also
represents that, prior to the date the Sale took place, he reviewed the appraisals of the Pavilion and Drew Centre,
the documents related to the outstanding security interests on those properties, and documents related to the pending
Chapter 11 proceeding by Triad. Based on his review of these documents, the Independent Fiduciary represents that
the ability of Triad to repay its obligation to the Plans was questionable. The Independent Fiduciary also represents
that the purchase price for the Notes exceeded the fair market value of the Notes as of the date of the Sale. The Independent
Fiduciary has determined that the purchase of the Notes by the Employer resulted in fully satisfying each of the obligations
owed by Triad to the Plans, that the transaction was protective of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries, and
that, therefore the transaction was in the best interests of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries. 

5. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction meets the statutory criteria for an exemption under
section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the Plans' independent fiduciary reviewed the terms and conditions of the exemption
and determined that the purchase of the Notes for full face value plus interest was in the best interest of the Plans'
participants and beneficiaries; (b) the Plans received a price which was not less than the fair market value of the
Notes; (c) the Sale was a one-time sale for cash; and (d) the Plans did not pay any expenses in connection with the Sale.

General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 

(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 

(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material
terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 



Statutory Findings 



In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 

(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

the Plans of two interests (the Interests) in a certain partnership to Lake Cities Land and Development, Inc., an affiliate
of the Plans' sponsor and a party in interest with respect to the Plans, provided that the following conditions are
satisfied:

Exemption 



I. Transactions 



A. Effective June 27, 1994, the restrictions of 
sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section
4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code shall not apply to the following transactions involving trusts and certificates
evidencing interests therein: 

(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and an employee benefit plan when the sponsor, servicer, trustee or insurer of a trust,
the underwriter of the certificates representing an interest in the trust, or an obligor is a party in interest with
respect to such plan; 

(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition 
of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates; and 


(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.A. (1) or (2).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.A. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(E),
406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate on behalf of an Excluded Plan by any person who has
discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of that Excluded Plan.






B. Effective June 27, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by

(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and a plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the investment of plan assets in the certificates is (a) an obligor with respect to 5 percent or less
of the fair market value of obligations or receivables contained in the trust, or (b) an affiliate of a person described
in (a); if:

(i) the plan is not an Excluded Plan;
(ii) solely in the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initial issuance of the certificates,
at least 50 percent of each class of certificates in which plans have invested is acquired by persons independent of

independent of the Restricted Group;

(iii) a plan's investment in each class of certificates does not exceed 25 percent of all of the certificates of that
class outstanding at the time of the acquisition; and

(iv) immediately after the acquisition of the certificates, no more than 25 percent of the assets of a plan with respect
to which the person has discretionary authority or renders investment advice are invested in certificates representing
an interest in a trust containing assets sold or serviced by the same entity.
 For purposes of this paragraph B(1)(iv) only, an entity will not be considered to service assets contained in a trust
if it is merely a subservicer of that trust;





(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates,
provided that the conditions set forth in paragraphs B.(1) (i), (iii) and (iv) are met; and

(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.B. (1) or (2). 

C. Effective June 27, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed
by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code, shall not apply to transactions in connection
with the servicing, management and operation of a trust, provided: 

(1) such transactions are carried out in accordance 
with the terms of a binding pooling and servicing arrangement; and 

(2) the pooling and servicing agreement is provided 
to, or described in all material respects in the prospectus or private placement memorandum provided to, investing
plans before they purchase certificates issued by the trust.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S. 

D. Effective June 27, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by sections
4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to any transactions
to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be a party in interest
or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services to the plan (or
by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Act
or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates. 



II. General Conditions 



A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 

(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 

(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D & P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 

(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 

(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 

(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933.

B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, 
insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part
I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of
such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum;
and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial
purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser
to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates)
is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
any such transferees 
will be required to make a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection
II.A.(6) above. 


III. Definitions 


For purposes of this exemption: 
A. ``Certificate'' means:

also means the trustee of the indenture trust. 

I. ``Insurer'' means the insurer or guarantor of, or provider of other credit support for, a trust. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a person is not an insurer solely because it holds securities representing an interest in a trust which
are of a class subordinated to certificates representing an interest in the same trust. 

J. ``Obligor'' means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation
or receivable included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment
notes secured by leases, ``obligor'' shall also include any owner of property subject to any lease included in the
trust, or subject to any lease securing an obligation included in the trust. 

K. ``Excluded Plan'' means any plan with respect to which any member of the Restricted Group is a ``plan sponsor'' within

or a spouse of a brother or sister of such other person; and 

(3) Any corporation or partnership of which such other person is an officer, director or partner. 

N. ``Control'' means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other
than an individual. 

O. A person will be ``independent'' of another person only if: 

(1) such person is not an affiliate of that other person; and

(2) the other person, or an affiliate thereof, is not a fiduciary who has investment management authority or renders
investment advice with respect to any assets of such person. 

P. ``Sale'' includes the entrance into a forward delivery commitment (as defined in section Q below), provided:

Q. ``Forward delivery commitment'' means a contract for the purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered
at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes both mandatory contracts (which contemplate obligatory delivery
and acceptance of the certificates) and optional contracts (which give one party the right but not the obligation
to deliver certificates to, or demand delivery of certificates from, the other party). 

R. ``Reasonable compensation'' has the same meaning as that term is defined in 29 CFR 2550.408c-2. 

S. ``Qualified Administrative Fee'' means a fee which meets the following criteria: 

(1) the fee is triggered by an act or failure to act by the obligor other than the normal timely payment of amounts owing
in respect of the obligations; 

(2) the servicer may not charge the fee absent the act or failure to act referred to in (1); 

(3) the ability to charge the fee, the circumstances in which the fee may be charged, and an explanation of how the fee
is calculated are set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement; and 

(4) the amount paid to investors in the trust will not be reduced by the amount of any such fee waived by the servicer.


T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an equipment note: 

(a) which is secured by equipment which is leased; 

(b) which is secured by the obligation of the lessee to pay rent under the equipment lease; and 

(c) with respect to which the trust's security interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the
trust as the trust would have if the equipment note were secured only by the equipment and not the lease. 

U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where: 

(a) the trust holds a security interest in the lease; 

(b) the trust holds a security interest in the leased motor vehicle; and 

(c) the trust's security interest in the leased motor vehicle is at least as protective of the trust's rights as the
trust would receive under a motor vehicle installment loan contract. 

V. ``Pooling and Servicing Agreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicer and the trustee
establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing
Agreement'' also includes the indenture entered into by the trustee of the trust issuing such certificates and the
indenture trustee.

General Information



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of
the exemption.

Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed the evaluation to the action and concludes that this action would not significantly
increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage. The performance history of Type A leak
tests at PBAPS, Unit 2, demonstrates adequate margin to acceptable leak rate limits. No time-based failure mechanisms
were identified that would significantly increase expected leak rates over the proposed extended interval. The
one historical Type A test failure at PBAPS, Unit 2, in June 1985, was determined to be an activity-related failure
which would not be related to an extended test interval. Thus radiological release rates will not differ from those
determined previously and would not be expected to result in undetectable leak rates in excess of the values established
by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J.

Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident radiological releases
be greater than previously determined. The proposed action does not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents
or increase occupational radiation exposures. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action
would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely
within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and
would result in increased radiation exposure to plant personnel.



Alternate Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1973.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The state official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated May 13, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Government Publications Section, State Library of Pennsylvania,
(Regional Depository) Education Building, Walnut Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box 1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
17105.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee) for operation
of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
The proposed amendment would extend the snubber functional testing interval from 18-months (+/^ 25%) to 24 months
(+/^ 25%), and to increase the sample plan size from 10% to 13.3%.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The proposed TS changes do not require any modifications to plant systems, snubbers, or other plant equipment. The
snubber will continue to function as designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and other dynamic transients
(e.g., main turbine trip). Extending the snubber functional testing interval from 18 months to 24 months ([greater
than or equal to] 25%) and increasing the initial sample size from 10% to 13.3%, as proposed, will continue to maintain
the same test scope ratio as that which currently exists (i.e. 1.5 yr./interval [at] 10% snubbers/interval and 2 yr./interval
[at] 13.3% snubbers/interval results in approximately 100% of all snubbers of a given type being tested within 15
years). The proposed TS change will only affect the interval between functional tests and the initial sample size
population. As previously stated, LGS currently uses the 10% plan for compensating struts only, and since there are
less than 10 struts per Unit, this proposed change will have a negligible impact on the number of struts in the initial
sample size to be tested during a particular interval (i.e., each refueling outage). All systems and equipment important
to safety that rely on snubbers will continue to function as designed.
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
The proposed TS changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems or equipment. The snubbers will continue
to function as designed to mitigate the effects of earthquakes and other dynamic transients (e.g., main turbine trip).
Snubbers are not accident initiators, and function to mitigate the effects of an accident. The snubbers will continue
to protect piping and equipment during dynamic events. Extending the snubber functional testing interval from 18
months to 24 months ([greater than or equal to] 25%) and increasing the initial sample size from 10% to 13.3%, as proposed,
will continue to maintain the same test scope ratio as that which currently exists in the TS. The proposed TS changes
will continue to ensure that approximately 100% of the snubbers of a given type are tested within a 15-year period.
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The bases for the TS require that all snubbers whose failure could have an adverse effect on any safety-related systems,
be operable. This ensures that the structural integrity of the reactor coolant system and other safety-related systems
are maintained during and following a seismic or other event initiating dynamic loads. The bases also discuss clarification
and grouping of the general snubber population, snubber listing requirements, visual inspection frequency, and
visual acceptance criteria. The proposed TS changes will provide for the same confidence level as that which currently
exists in TS for determining snubber operability. The proposed TS changes will continue to maintain the same test
scope ratio as that currently provided in the TS. The 10% plan is used at LGS for compensating struts only, and increasing
initial sample size to 13.3%, as proposed, will have a negligible effect on the number of struts functionally tested
during each interval. No other aspects of the bases associated with snubber surveillance will be affected by these
proposed TS changes.

Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By October 31, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street, Pottstown,
Pennsylvania 19464. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Mohan C. Thadani (Acting): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to J.W. Durham, Sr. V.P. and General Counsel, Philadelphia Electric Company, 2301 Market
Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 16, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Pottstown Public Library, 500 High Street,
Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
Licenses Nos. DRP-64 and DPR-59, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee),
for operation of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New
York, and the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (FitzPatrick) located in Oswego County, New York, respectively.

The proposed amendments would revise Section 6.0 (Administrative Controls) of the Technical Specifications of
both facilities to reflect, in part, licensee management changes. Specifically, the title of Executive Vice President_Nuclear
Generation is being changed to Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer and a new position, Vice President
Regulatory Affairs and Special Projects, which will report to the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer,
is being established. In addition, the list of Safety Review Committee (SRC) members is being deleted and replaced
with a description of SRC membership requirements, including individual qualifications. Each SRC member, including
the alternates, will have to be approved by the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendments, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with
the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




Operation of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power plants in accordance with the proposed amendment[s]
would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed
change is purely administrative and does not involve plant equipment or operating parameters. There is no change
to any accident analysis assumptions or other conditions which could effect previously evaluated accidents. The
proposed change will not decrease the effectiveness of the organization's ability to respond to a design basis accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. Since the proposed
change is administrative in nature and does not involve hardware design or operation, it cannot create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The authority and responsibilities of the Resident Managers
and the Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer with respect to the safe operation and maintenance of the
FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear plant are not being reduced or otherwise changed.

The proposed changes do not reduce the effectiveness of the SRC as an oversight committee.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facilities, the Commission may issue the license amendments before the expiration
of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendments involve no significant
hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the
Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By October 31, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendments to the subject
facility operating licenses and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document rooms located at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White
Plains, New York 10601 and the Penfield Library, State University of New York, Oswego, New York 13126. If a request
for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
The petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention which must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to
file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendments and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendments.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendments.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Michael J. Case: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendments dated September 16, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,

<DOCTITLE>Texas Utilities Electric Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-87 and NPF-89, for Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, located
in Somervell County, Texas, operated by Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee).
The proposed amendment would change the technical specifications to review the 18-month surveillance requirements
for certain emergency core cooling system, containment system, and plant systems to eliminate the restriction that
these surveillances be performed during shutdown or during the refueling mode or cold shutdown.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
These proposed technical specification changes delete the restrictions that only tests which are performed ``during
shutdown'' or ``during REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' be used to comply with certain surveillance requirements.
The tests of concern are equally valid whether they are performed during shutdown or if they are performed entirely
or in part at power. ``Testing at power'' was never prohibited by the technical specifications although, for these
surveillances, ``testing while shutdown'' was required. The testing which is performed at power is reviewed to ensure
that the proper prerequisites are established, including the proper unit mode of operation and the proper circuit
blocks. Significant portions of the testing needed to comply with these surveillance requirements, and in some cases
the entire test, are already performed while at power as part of the test procedures which are used to comply with other
surveillance requirements such as the Slave Relay Testing. In general, removing the ``during shutdown'' and ``during
REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' restrictions from these surveillance requirements will eliminate the need to
reperform, while shutdown, those portions of the testing which are already routinely performed at power. Deleting
such ``retest'' requirements does not reduce safety, cannot increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated, and is more likely to reduce the probability of a transient by eliminating duplicative testing.
In the future, it is possible that TU Electric may choose to perform additional portions of these tests at power. Since
these portions are not being performed at power now, the net effect is not the deletion of a retest but a change in the
required conditions for that portion of the test. Such a change would require a change in the test procedure and would
only be allowed if technically and operationally acceptable and if the change did not constitute an unreviewed safety
question per 10 CFR 50.59. These controls are adequate to ensure that any future changes in the test procedures as a
result of these proposed technical specification changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.
The elimination of the requirement to ``retest'' circuits or equipment which are already tested at power cannot create
any failure modes which could result in a new or different kind of accident. The controls which presently exist on revisions
to procedures and on testing will ensure that any revisions to test procedures which allow testing which is now performed
while shutdown to be performed while operating, are technically and operationally acceptable and will not result
in an unreviewed safety question and as such will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated.
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
The ``during shutdown'' or ``during the REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' restriction on these surveillance requirements
was intended to provide a margin of safety by avoiding unnecessary unit transients and by avoiding placing the unit
in an unanalyzed condition. This intention seems reasonable based on the knowledge that portions of the testing should
not be performed at power and that doing the entire surveillance test while shutdown should not have an adverse impact.
The proposed changes do not affect system performance or acceptance limits. Because a large portion of the testing,
and in some cases the entire test, would be performed at power as a result of other requirements or expectations, the
proposed technical specification changes eliminate duplicative testing and, as such, will not reduce the margin
of safety.
The impact of revising existing test procedures, as a result of this technical specification change, to allow additional
testing to be performed at power, would be properly addressed in the reviews performed as part of the procedure changes,
including the required 10 CFR 50.59 review, and when considered along with the reduction in shutdown risk that could
result from such changes, it is concluded that such procedure changes will not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the

<DOCTITLE>Texas Utilities Electric Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-87 and NPF-89, for the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, located
in Somervell County, Texas, operated by Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee).

The proposed amendment would change the technical specifications to allow a one-time extension of emergency diesel
generator and related surveillance testing from 18 to 24 months. These changes apply to Unit 2 only

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.


These are a one-time extensions. The proposed changes only extend the surveillance test intervals and do not alter
the function or operation of the equipment and are consistent with the philosophy of Generic Letter (GL) 91-04.
The surveillances relate to mitigation features and have no impact on probability of an accident. The only impact
on consequences would result from the component or system reliability. The reliability of the affected systems and
components is not being affected since the same testing will be performed but with a one-time extended test interval.



Many features are tested more frequently by other surveillances and the ESF [emergency safety features] actuation
surveillances (response time tests) have historically been successful, therefore, any increase in probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would be insignificant.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident.


These are one-time extensions. No new accident scenarios are being introduced because neither the testing nor the
methodology itself are been affected. Only the interval between testing is being changed consistent with the intent
of GL 91-04.


3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

These are one-time extensions. Margin of safety is not significantly affected because no test functions are being
omitted and many attributes of the systems will continue to be verified in other surveillance tests. The increased
time between surveillances, which could result in a slight decrease in assumed equipment reliability, is mitigated
by the facts that many features are tested more frequently by other surveillances and by the relatively short duration
of the extension. In addition, minimizing train outages during refueling outages and using demonstrated test procedures
reduces the risk of events occurring during the outage and improves safety. Overall, because the potential impact
on equipment reliability is small and because of the reduced shutdown risks, this license amendment request does
not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety but potentially increases the margin of safety.

the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition;
and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate
order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest
of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing
conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must
include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific
statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief
explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support
the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner
must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which
the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information
to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited
to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would
entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements
with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Specialist Concentration



September 26, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on August 30, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'`) filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is granting accelerated approval
and is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange seeks to obtain accelerated effectiveness as to a one-year extension of the Specialist Concentration
Policy pilot program.
 This will continue to permit the Exchange's Executive Committee to review proposed combinations that, in the Exchange's
view, may lead to undue concentration within the specialist community. The Exchange therefore requests the Commission
to find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Accelerated approval is hereby granted for the reasons stated below.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the concentration policy pilot program, which establishes certain
standards based on Consolidated Tape Association (``CTA'') ranking
 of specialist stocks for reviewing certain proposed mergers, acquisitions and other combinations between or among
specialist units. The proposed policy would authorize the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors to review
proposed combinations that, in the Exchange's view, may lead to undue concentration within the specialist community.





The Executive Committee will review any arrangement where previously separate specialist organizations would
be operating under common control and would comprise:

(a) 15% or more of the 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or,

(b) 15% or more of the second 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or,

(c) 20% or more of the third 100 most actively traded CTA stocks; or,

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940930-2-00210 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940930-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) 15% or more of all the CTA stocks eligible for trading on the BSE where the Free List contains fewer than 100 issues.






The Executive Committee shall approve or disapprove the proposed combination based on its assessment of the following
considerations:

(a) Specialist performance and market quality in the stocks subjects to the proposed combination;

(b) The effects of proposed combination in terms of the following criteria:




(i) Strengthening the capital base of the resulting specialist organization;

(ii) Minimizing both the potential for financial failure and the negative consequences of any such failure on the
specialist system as a whole; and 

(iii) Maintaining or increasing operational efficiencies;




(c) Commitment to the Exchange market, focusing on whether the constituent specialist organizations engage in business
activities that might detract from the resulting specialist organization's willingness or ability to act to strengthen
the Exchange agency/auction market and its competitiveness in relation to other markets; and

(d) The effect of the proposed combination on overall concentration of specific organizations.

With respect to the criteria relating to the ``commitment to the Exchange market'', the Executive Committee would
look to a variety of factors that extend beyond compliance with the Exchange's requirements for providing sufficient
capital, talent and order handling services. For example, the Committee would review and assess each constituent
unit's past performance on the Exchange relating to such matters as:

 Acceptance and cooperation in the development, implementation and enhancement to the Boston Exchange Automated
Communications and Order-routing Network (``BEACON'');

 Efforts at resolving problems concerning customer orders;

 Willingness to facilitate early openings in order to compete effectively with other exchanges; and

 Willingness to voluntarily provide Execution Guarantees beyond the minimum required under Rule 2039A.






2. Statutory Basis



The Exchange believes that the basis under the Act for the proposed policy is Section 6(b)(5) in that the policy enables
the Exchange to monitor the tendencies toward concentration in the specialist community and to intervene to prevent
undue concentration. As such, it is designed to protect investors and the public interest, and is not designed to permit
unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to regulate by virtue of any authority
conferred by this title matters not related to the purpose of this title or the administration of the Exchange.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed policy will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



Comments have neither been solicited nor received.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-BSE-94-10
and should be submitted by October 21, 1994.

IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the BSE's proposal to extend its pilot program regarding specialist concentration for
an additional one-year period is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6 of the Act.
 For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the BSE proposal to extend its specialist concentration
pilot furthers the objectives of Section 6 of the Act.





The Commission believes it is necessary to extend the pilot program's operation in order to afford both the Exchange
and the Commission a further opportunity to evaluate the pilot's operation during the Commission's consideration
of permanent approval of the concentration rules. Although the pilot has been in effect since February, 1990, only
two proposed combinations have triggered an extensive Committee review by exceeding the concentration limits set
forth in the policy. Consequently, the Commission believes that the Exchange, in conjunction with the SEC, needs
additional time to fully evaluate the operation of the concentration policy and to determine whether the concentration
rules are enhancing the quality of the markets that specialist units make and thus improve the standards of specialist
performance. The Commission believes that allowing the Exchange an additional one-year period in which to implement
the pilot will enable the Exchange and the Commission to adequately address the effectiveness of the pilot.

In its prior orders renewing and extending the pilot program,
 the Commission requested that the BSE develop criteria to evaluate the effects of its concentration rules on the activities
of specialists and to determine, for example, whether implementation of these rules is increasing the performance
and effectiveness of specialists and aiding in the prevention of undue concentration. Specifically, the Commission
requested that the BSE submit a report to the Commission addressing, among other things, the following issues: the
number of proposed specialist combinations that have triggered an Executive Committee review since the inception
of the pilot program and the circumstances surrounding these reviews; whether the existence of more firms has increased
competition among specialists for new stock allocations; whether the concentration rules have increased incentives
for quality markets and higher standards for performance; and the impact that the specialist combination rules have
had upon the competitive environment necessary to maintain an orderly market.





In response to the Commission's request, the BSE submitted a letter
 which addressed many of the issues the Commission outlined in previous orders. The BSE stated that, during the last
pilot period, there have been no proposed specialist combinations that exceeded the concentration limits set forth
in the policy.
 The BSE reported that the last combination reviewed under the concentration policy was in February of 1993. The acquisition
was discussed in the previous pilot extension approval order.






The Commission also asked the BSE to discuss various other issues, identical to the requests made during the previous
one-year pilot periods. The BSE's responses were identical to those submitted pursuant to the previous pilot extension
due to the absence of relevant data during the last year.

During the extended pilot period, as was requested during the previous one-year pilot periods, the Commission expects
the Exchange to continue to develop criteria to evaluate the effects of its concentration rules on the activities
of specialists. In this regard, the Commission expects the BSE to report to the Commission by May 1, 1995, the number
of proposed specialist combinations that have triggered an Executive Committee review since the extension of the
pilot program and the circumstances surrounding these reviews; whether competition among specialists for new stock
allocations as well as specialists and specialist firms applying for those allocations since the inception of the
pilot program;
 and whether any of the specialist firms that have undergone Executive Committee review have demonstrated an improvement
in specialist evaluation results or displayed a higher quality of markets. In addition, the Commission remains interested
in whether the BSE finds that the concentration rules have assisted the Exchange in increasing order flow and if so,
the reasons for this conclusion, as well as the impact that the specialist combination rules have had upon the competitive
environment necessary to maintain an orderly market.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the extension of the pilot program furthers the protection
of investors and the public interest because it allows the Exchange additional time to evaluate the effectiveness
of the pilot program on an uninterrupted basis during the Commission's consideration of the Exchange's request for
permanent approval of its rules for reviewing proposed specialist combinations and because the BSE's concentration
policy may result in higher quality markets and improved standards of specialist performance. Further, the substance
of the proposal has been noticed previously in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and the Commission did not receive any comments on it.








It Is Therefore Ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2)
 that SR-BSE-94-10 is hereby approved on a pilot basis through August 13, 1995.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Equity Floor Procedure Advice E-A-1_Responsibility for Displaying Best Bid and Offer Prices</DOCTITLE>



September 26, 1994.



On July 15, 1991, as subsequently amended on June 23, 1994,
 and July 14, 1994,
 the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt Phlx Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') E-A-1: Responsibility
for Displaying Best Bid and Offer Prices Established on the Equity Floor (the ``Advice'').








The proposed rule change, including amendment no. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 34342 (July 11, 1994), 59 FR 36244 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.

The Advice being adopted requires specialists to display the best bid and offer available in their assigned securities.
The specialists' responsibility will be different for primary stock issues
 and secondary stock issues.
 For primary securities, specialists' will be responsible for ensuring that the best bid and offer voiced on the floor
of the Exchange is properly and timely displayed for dissemination purposes. For securities in which the specialists
make secondary markets, specialists will be responsible for ensuring proper and timely display of the best bid or
offer so long as such bid or offer is equal to or superior to all other bids or offers reflected and disseminated at the
time by the national securities exchanges.






In addition, the Advice will be included in the Exchange's minor rule plan.
 The fine schedule below will be applied when an Exchange review identifies that five percent or more of the bids or offers
have not been properly displayed in a timely fashion. The following schedule will be implemented on a three year running
calendar basis:









The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules
of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





The Commission has long believed that transparency plays a fundamental role in the fairness and efficiency of the
secondary markets. Transparency may be defined as the extent to which trading information (

i.e., 

information regarding quotations, price, and volume of transactions) is made publicly available promptly after
either the entry of a quotation or the completion of a transaction. As the Commission's Division of Market Regulation
(``Division'') stated in its Market 2000 Study,
 at least three tangible benefits flow from transparency: (1) Transparency enhances investor protection because
it makes it easier for investors to monitor the quality of executions they receive from their intermediaries, (2)
transparency encourages investor participation in the market, and thereby promotes market liquidity, and (3) transparency
fosters the efficiency of securities markets by facilitating price discovery and open competition, and thus counteracts
the effects of fragmentation.

The Division noted in the 

Market 2000 Study

 that the failure to display limit orders that are priced better than current quotes raises at least three regulatory
concerns. First, the failure to display limit orders could artificially widen spreads, which raises the concern
that investors are receiving unfair prices. Second, the failure to display limit orders raises fair competition
concerns. If the quotes from a market or market maker do not fully represent the buying and selling interest, markets
will lose incentives to compete based on quotes, and the price discovery process may be impaired. Third, with many
markets offering automatic executions of small orders at the best displayed quotes, a failure to display the best
quotes results in inferior executions for some small-order customers. The Division therefore recommended that
the SROs encourage the display of all limit orders in listed stocks that are better than the best intermarket quotes
(unless the ultimate customer expressly requests that an order not be displayed), noting that such a requirement
would provide a more accurate picture of trading interest, result in tighter spreads, and contribute to improved
price discovery.






The Commission believes that the Phlx proposal will result in increased transparency to the benefit of investors.
In particular, the Commission believes that the portion of Advice E-A-1 which requires specialists to
display the best bid or offer price on the floor for primary stock issues will be beneficial because it should increase
transparency and provide an indication of market interest for stocks in which Phlx is the primary market. For secondary
issues, the requirements for the display of bids and offers will also be beneficial to market participants because
it will provide to other market centers in the national market system all Phlx bids and offers that are equal to or superior
to bids and offers displayed in the system. Such a standard is consistent with the discussion of limit order display
in the 

Market 2000 Study, 

noted above.

The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to include Advice E-A-1 in the Phlx's minor rule plan
because a violation of the dissemination requirements for the best bids or offers should not entail the complicated
factual and interpretative inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary actions under
Phlx Rule 960. The Commission further believes that the fine schedule, which is graduated to account for repeat offenders
and will be administered on a three-year rolling calendar basis under the Phlx's minor rule plan, should provide a
prompt, effective and appropriate means to enforce compliance with the Advice. Moreover, under the Phlx's minor
rule plan, a person fined under the Advice will be permitted to contest the fine pursuant to Phlx Rule 970 and will be
entitled to full due process.




It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-91-20) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Applicants' Representations



1. Each of the Trusts is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment
company. Some of the Trusts consist of multiple series each of which has separate investment objectives and policies
and segregated assets. Each Trust, and each Trust on behalf of its series, if any, has either: (i) Entered into an investment
advisory agreement with Citibank, or (ii) invested all of the investable assets of the Trust or series in another open-end
management investment company that has entered into an investment advisory agreement with Citibank (such management
investment company referred to herein as a ``Hub

SM

 Portfolio''). Each of the Trusts has adopted an Administrative Services Plan that provides that the Trust may obtain
the services of an administrator, a transfer agent, a custodian, a fund accounting agent (in the case of those Trusts
for which the custodian does not act as fund accounting agent) and one or more shareholder servicing agents. Pursuant
to the Administrative Services Plan, each Trust has entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with LFBDS,
pursuant to which LFBDS provides non-investment management, administrative services. Citibank performs sub-administrative
duties for each Trust pursuant to a Sub-Administrative Services Agreement with LFBDS. LFBDS, a registered broker-dealer,
is the principal underwriter of the Trusts, and shares of each Trust are currently offered through LFBDS to customers
of entities (``shareholder servicing agents'') that have entered into shareholder servicing agreements (``Shareholder
Servicing Agreements'') with such Trust pursuant to the Trust's Administrative Services Plan.
 Under the Shareholder Servicing Agreements, financial institutions including Citibank Companies and securities
brokers provide various account and customer services in connection with the shares. For such services, each shareholder
servicing agent receives a service fee
 and a shareholder servicing fee
 from the Trust.

2. The shares of the Trusts, except for money market funds, are currently sold at net asset value (``NAV'') subject
to a conventional front-end sales charge. Each Trust has also adopted a distribution plan in accordance with rule
12b-1 authorizing it to pay LFBDS a distribution fee (the ``Distribution Plan'') (collectively, the Distribution
Plans and the Administrative Services Plans are referred to herein as the ``Plans'').

3. Applicants propose to establish a Multiple Distribution system enabling each fund to offer investors the option
of purchasing shares with either (a) A front-end sales load (which may vary among the Funds) (except for sales of $1
million or more which are subject to a CDSC for the twelve-month period following purchase and except in the case of
the money market funds) and, in most cases, Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder
servicing fee (the ``Front-End Load Option'' or ``Class A shares''), (b) without a front-end sales load but subject
to a CDSC (which may vary among the Funds) and Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder
servicing fee (the ``Deferred Option'' or ``Class B shares'), or (c) without a front-end sales load or CDSC, but subject
to Plans providing for a distribution fee and/or service fee and/or shareholder servicing fee (the ``Level Load Option''
or ``Class C shares''). It is presently intended that the money market funds other than Landmark Cash Reserves (``LCR''),
a series of Landmark Funds III, will offer only one class of shares which will be sold without a front-end load or CDSC
but subject to Plans providing for a distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fee. Any distribution
arrangement of a Fund, including distribution and service fees and front-end and deferred sales loads, will comply
with the NASD rule. 

4. Applicants also seek authority to create one or more additional classes of shares in the future, the terms of which
differ from the Class A, Class B, and Class C shares only in the following respects: (i) Any such class may bear different
distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fees (or may have no distribution, service, or shareholder servicing
fees) and any other costs relating to implementing the Plans for such class or an amendment to such Plans (including
obtaining shareholder approval of such Plans or any amendment thereto), (ii) any such class may bear any incremental
difference in transfer agency fees, (iii) any such class may bear different class designations, (iv) voting rights
on matters which pertain to the Plans, except as provided in condition 15, (v) any such class may bear any other incremental
expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to such class which shall be approved by the Commission
pursuant to an amended order, (vi) any such class may have different conversion features, (vii) any such class may
have different exchange privileges, and (viii) any such class will bear only those printing and postage expenses
(not otherwise payable by a shareholder servicing agent) relating to preparing and distributing materials such
as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements (hereafter ``Class Expenses'') relating to that class
of shares.

5. After a shareholder's Class B shares remain outstanding for a specified period of time (not to exceed eight years),
they will automatically convert to Class A shares of the same Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes,
and will thereafter be subject to the lower aggregate distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fees under
the Class A Plans applicable to the Class A shares. For purposes of conversion to Class A, all shares in a shareholder's
account purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares
will considered to be held in the separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's account convert
to Class A, a proportional amount of Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A.

6. Any other class of shares may provide that shares in that class (the ``Purchase Class'') will, after a period of time,
automatically convert into another class of shares (the ``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values
of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge, provided that, after conversion,
the converted shares would be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in the NASD rule) and/or a shareholder servicing fee, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge
and service fee and shareholder servicing fee to which the Purchase Class shares were subject prior to the conversion.
Such a conversion feature will be described in the relevant prospectus. (The term ``Purchase Class'' hereafter refers
to any class of shares, including Class B shares, with a conversion feature).

7. Any conversion of shares of one class to shares of another class is subject to the continuing availability of a ruling
of the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conversion of shares does into constitute
a taxable event under federal income tax law. Any such conversion may be suspended if such a ruling or opinion is no longer
available.

8. Under the Multiple Distribution System, all expenses incurred by a Fund will be borne proportionately by each class
based on the relative net assets attributable to each such class, except for the different: (a) Distribution, service,
and shareholder servicing fees, and any other costs relating to implementing the Plans or an amendment to such Plans
(including obtaining shareholder approval of a Plan or an amendment to such Plan); (b) Class Expenses; and (c) possibly
transfer agency fees (and any other incremental expense properly attributable to a class which the Commission shall
approve by amended order) attributable to a class, which will be borne directly by each respective class.

9. LFBDS or shareholder servicing agents may choose to reimburse or waive distribution, service, or shareholder
servicing fees on certain classes of a Fund on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount on such fees waived or reimbursed
by LFBDS or shareholder servicing agents may vary from class to class. Such fees are by their nature specific to a given
class and may vary from one class to another. Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder
expectations to reimburse or waive such fees at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.

10. In addition, LFBDS, Citibank, or other service contractors may waive or reimburse certain fees or expenses which
do not vary from class to class but apply equally to all classes of a given Fund (``Fund expenses'') provided that the
same proportionate amount of Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class of a Fund. Any Fund expenses that
are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes.

11. To the extent exchanges are permitted, such exchanges will comply with all applicable provisions of rule 11a-3
under the Act.

12. Applicants also request relief to permit each of the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of certain classes
of shares of such Fund, and, from time to time, as described below, to permit such Fund to waive, reduce, or defer the
CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions of such shares. The amount of the CDSC to be imposed will depend on
the amount of time since the investor purchased the shares being redeemed, as set forth in each Fund's prospectus.
The amount of any applicable CDSC will be based upon the lower of the net asset value at the time of purchase or at the time
of redemption as required by proposed rule 6c-10(a)(1)(i) under the Act. If a shareholder holding shares of
more than one class does not specify which class of shares of a Fund are to be redeemed, the following order of redemption
will apply: (a) Shares of a Fund not subject to a CDSC and subject to the highest distribution and/or service and/or
shareholder servicing fees in effect on the date of redemption will be redeemed first (provided, however, that if
such shares of the Fund are subject to the same distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees then
shares of the Fund without a conversion feature will be redeemed before shares of the Fund with a conversion feature),
then (b) shares of the Fund subject to the lowest CDSC will be redeemed, provided that if such shares of the Fund are subject
to the same CDSC, shares of the Fund with the highest distribution and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees
in effect on the date of redemption will be redeemed first. If such shares of the Fund are subject to the same distribution
and/or service and/or shareholder servicing fees, then shares of the Fund without a conversion feature will be redeemed
before shares of the Fund with a conversion feature.

13. Applicants also propose to permit LFBDS from time to time to provide a credit (i.e., a reimbursement) for any CDSC
paid by a redeeming shareholder in connection with a redemption of shares of a class followed by a reinvestment in any
shares of the same class of the same Fund or, as permitted by LFBDS from time to time, the same class of another Fund, effected
within such number of days of the redemption as may be specified, from time to time, in a Fund's prospectus (the ``Reinstatement
Privilege''). The CDSC credit will be paid by LFBDS. Upon redemption thereafter, when calculating the amount of the
CDSC (if any), the shares will be deemed to have been held for one continuous period from purchase through redemption
and reinvestment until such shares are finally redeemed.

14. If the Funds waive, defer, or reduce the CDSC for a particular class, such waiver, deferment, or reduction will
be uniformly applied to all offerees in a class with similar qualifications. In waiving, deferring, or reducing a
CDSC, the Funds will comply with the requirements of rule 22d-1. If a Fund that has been waiving, deferring, or
reducing its CDSC for a particular class discontinues such waiver, deferment, or reduction, (a) such waiver, deferment,
or reduction will continue to apply to shares of such Fund then outstanding, and (b) the disclosure in that Fund's prospectus
relating to that class will be revised appropriately. No CDSC will be imposed on shares issued prior to the date of the
requested order.



Applicants' Legal Conclusions



1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) exempting the Funds' proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes
of securities to the extent that such issuance and sale might be deemed to result in a ``senor security'' within the
meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and to violate the equal voting provisions
of section 18(i).

2. The creation of multiple classes does not present the concerns that section 18 was designed to address. The proposed
arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect any Fund's existing assets or reserves, nor increase the speculative
character of any Fund shares. The Funds' capital structures under the proposed arrangement will not induce any group
of shareholders to invest in higher risk securities to the detriment of any other group of shareholders since the investment
risks of each Fund will be borne equally by all of its shareholders.

3. Mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to each class of shares in a Fund. Further, (a) Since each class of
shares will be redeemable at all times, (b) since no class of shares will have any preference or priority over any other
class in the Fund, and (c) since the similarities and dissimilarities of the classes of shares will be disclosed in
the Funds' prospectuses, investors will not be given misleading impressions as to the safety or risk of any class of
shares, and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative.

4. The Funds' capital structures under the proposed arrangement will not enable insiders to manipulate expenses
and profits among the various classes of shares since all the expenses and profits of a particular Fund (except the
different fees of any Plan applicable to a class of shares, any higher incremental transfer agency fees, Class Expenses
attributable to a class of shares and any other incremental expense subsequently identified that should be properly
allocated to a particular class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order) will be borne


pro rata

 by all the shares of the Fund, irrespective of class, and all shareholders will have equal voting rights except with
respect to matters pertaining to the Plans and related agreements. The concerns that a complex capital structure
may facilitate control without equity or other investment and may make it difficult for investors to value the securities
of the Funds are not present.

5. The proposed arrangement will permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide
investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping
costs. Moreover, owners of each class of shares may be relieved of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated
with investing in mutual funds since such costs would potentially be spread over a greater number of shares than they
would otherwise.



Applicants' Multiple Class Conditions



Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:

1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of that Fund, and will
be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of
the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the different distribution, service, and shareholder servicing
fee payments associated with any Plan relating to a particular class of shares and any other costs relating to the implementation
of such Plan or any amendment thereto (including obtaining shareholder approval of such Plan or any amendment thereto)
which will be borne solely by shareholders of such class, any incremental transfer agency fees attributable solely
to a particular class of shares of the Fund, and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should
be properly allocated to one class and which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order, (b) voting
rights on matters which pertain to the Plans, except as provided in Condition No. 15 below, (c) the different exchange
privileges of each class of shares, (d) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund, (e) the differences in the
conversion features of each class of shares, and (f) any differences in Class Expenses of each class of shares.

2. The Board of Trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will approve the Multiple
Distribution System for a particular Fund prior to its implementation by such Fund. The minutes of the meetings of
the Trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution
System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multiple Distribution
System is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders.

3. On an ongoing basis, the Boards of Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the
Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the
various classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take such action
as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflict that may develop. Citibank and LFBDS will be responsible
for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, Citibank and LFBDS, at their
own cost, will take steps to remedy such conflict, up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.

4. The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution, service and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as amended from time to time. In
these statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale of a particular class of shares or to the provision
of services to holders of such shares will be used to justify any distribution or service or shareholder servicing
fee attributable to such class. Expenditures not related to the sale or service of a particular class of shares or to
services provided to holders of such shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the Independent Trustees of the Funds in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

5. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that (i) Distribution, service
and shareholder servicing payments associated with any Plans relating to a particular class of shares (any other
costs relating to implementing the Plans for such class or any amendment to such Plan including obtaining shareholder
approval of the Plans for such class or any amendment to such Plans) will be borne exclusively by that class; (ii) any
incremental transfer agency fees relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by that class; (iii) Class
Expenses relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by that class; and (iv) any other incremental expenses
subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to a particular class which shall be approved by the Commission
pursuant to an amended order will be borne exclusively by such class.

6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to the applicants, a copy of which has been filed as Exhibit D to the application, stating that
such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate
manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the
calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to
the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as
part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30 (b)(1) of the Act. The workpapers
of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to make), will be available
for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Fund for such workpapers by a senior member of
the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators
or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on the policies and procedures
placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and
tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time
to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

7. The applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in condition no. 6 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition no. 6 above. Applicants agree
to take immediate corrective measures if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing
reports.

8. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class over another in the Fund.

9. LFBDS will adopt compliance standards regarding when a class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. LFBDS will require its registered representatives and all broker-dealer firms with which it enters into
selling agreements and all financial institutions with which it enters into agency agreements regarding the Funds
to agree to conform to such standards.

10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive relief is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished
to the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees.

11. Each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements,
services, fees, sales loads, contingent deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable
to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus.
The shareholder reports of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each
class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of
operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share
data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to the classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent
any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided
by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering prices
will present each class of shares separately.

12. The applicant acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their
Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

13. Purchase Class shares will convert into Target Class shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the
two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares
will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section
26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice) and/or shareholder servicing fee, if any, that in the aggregate are lower than
the asset-based sales charge and service fee and shareholder servicing fee to which they were subject prior to the
conversion.

14. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and
any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, including
a majority of the Independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of the monies
paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Board of Trustees, and the Board of Trustees shall
review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Plans that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the
Target Class shares under the Plans, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares
unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Trustees shall take
such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares.
If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing
Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to the existing Purchase Class shares in
all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. The New Target Class or the
New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition
shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to Federal taxation. In accordance
with Condition No. 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target
Class or the New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by Citibank and LFBDS. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation
of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material
features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an
effective registration statement.

16. The Administrative Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.



Applicants' CDSC Condition



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the condition that applicants will
comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act (Release No. IC-16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)),
as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

General Public Utilities Corporation, et al. (70-7926) 


General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered
holding company, and its public-utility subsidiary companies Jersey Central Power & Light Company (``JCP&L''),
300 Madison Avenue, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike,
P.O. Box 16001, Reading, Pennsylvania 19640 and Pennsylvania Electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street,
Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907 (collectively, the ``GPU Companies''), have filed a post-effective amendment under
sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rules 53 and 54 thereunder to their declaration previously filed under sections 6(a)
and 7 and rule 50(a)(5). 

By order dated March 18, 1992 (HCAR No. 25493) (``Order''), the Commission authorized the GPU Companies from time
to time through March 31, 1995 to: (1) Issue, sell and renew unsecured promissory notes (``Notes'') in amounts up to
$150 million outstanding at any one time and maturing not more than six months from the date of issue, to certain banks
under the terms of a revolving credit agreement (``Credit Agreement'') with Citibank, N.A. and Chemical Bank as co-agents
and Chemical Bank as the administrative agent; (2) issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes, maturing
not more than nine months from the date of issue, pursuant to loan participation arrangements and informal lines of
credit (``Lines of Credit'') in amounts up to the limitations on short-term indebtedness contained in their respective
charters but, the case of GPU, $200 million; (3) incur other short-term unsecured debt (``Other Short-Term Debt''),
from time to time, in amounts up to the limits permitted by their respective charters but, in the case of GPU, $200 million;
and (4) in the case of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec, issue and sell their respective unsecured promissory notes as
commercial paper (``Commercial Paper'') in amounts up to their respective charter limits. In no event, however,
would the total amount of such unsecured debt of any GPU Company outstanding at any one time exceed the limitations
on such indebtedness imposed by such company's charter but, in case of GPU, $200 million. 

At June 30, 1994, the charter limits of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec would have permitted them to have maximum short-term
indebtedness outstanding at any one time of $275, $122 and $137 million, respectively.

The GPU Companies now propose to extend the term of the Credit Agreement and to provide for an increase in the amount
of borrowings that the GPU Companies may make thereunder. They also propose to extend and increase their other short-term
borrowing capability. Accordingly, the GPU Companies now request authority from the effective date of the authorization
herein sought through December 31, 1997 from time to time (1) To issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes
(``New Notes'') to certain banks (``Banks'') under the terms of a new revolving credit agreement or an amendment to
the existing agreement (``New Credit Agreement'') in amounts up to $250 million outstanding at any one time, (2) to
issue, sell and renew their unsecured promissory notes pursuant to loan participation arrangements and lines of
credit (``New Lines of Credit'') in amounts up to the limitations on short-term indebtedness contained in their respective
charters and, in the case of GPU, $200 million, (3) in the cases of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec to issue and sell their
respective unsecured promissory notes as commercial paper (``New Commercial Paper'') in amounts up to their respective
charter limits, and (4) to incur other short-term unsecured debt from time to time in amounts up to the limits permitted
by their respective charters and, in the case of GPU, $200 million. In no event, however, would the total amount of such
unsecured debt of any GPU Company outstanding at any one time exceed the limitation on such indebtedness imposed by
such Company's charter and, in the case of GPU, $200 million. Citibank, N.A. and Chemical Bank would serve as co-agents
under the New Credit Agreement and Chemical Bank would also serve as administrative agent.
New Notes issued under the New Credit Agreement would mature not more than six months from their date of issue. The annual
interest rate on each borrowing would be either (a) The Alternate Base Rate, as in effect from time to time, (b) the CD
Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus an amount ranging from .375% to .625% depending upon the Debt Rating of the
borrower and, in the case of GPU, the Debt Rating of JCP&L, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate, as in effect from time to time,
plus an amount ranging from .25% to .50% depending upon the Debt Rating of the borrower and, in the case of GPU, the Debt
Rating of JCP&L.
The New Credit Agreement will afford the GPU Companies the option of inviting competitive bids from the Banks for requested
maturities of up to six months in such principal amounts as a GPU Company may request, subject to the $250 million limit
of the New Credit Agreement ($200 million in the case of GPU). No Bank would be required to bid for any such loan and the
GPU Companies would not be obligated to accept any bids received.
The GPU Companies propose to pay the Banks a facility fee ranging from .125% to .375% per annum, depending on the Debt
Ratings of Met-Ed, JCP&L and Penelec, of the total amount of the commitment, and a competitive bid fee of $2,500
for each request for a competitive bid. In addition, an agency fee of $25,000 would be payable to each of the Co-Agents
upon signing of the New Credit Agreement, and an annual administrative agent fee of $15,000 would be payable to Chemical
Bank.
Issuance of the New Notes would be subject to certain conditions, and the New Notes would be subject to acceleration
under certain circumstances. Borrowings bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate would be prepayable at any time,
without penalty; borrowings at the CD Rate or the Eurodollar Rate would also be prepayable, subject to payment of certain
costs incurred by the Banks in connection with the prepayment; borrowings at a competitive bid rate would not be prepayable.
Each borrowing pursuant to an unsecured promissory note issued under New Lines of Credit will bear interest at a rate
(after giving effect to any fees or compensating balance requirements) not exceeding 125% of the greater of (A) The
lending bank's prime rate for commercial borrowing in effect from time to time, and (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus
1/2 of 1%, will mature not more than nine months from the date of issuance, will be prepayable only to the extent provided
therein and will not be issued as part of a public offering. New Lines of Credit borrowings may include borrowings under
which a GPU Company would execute a master unsecured promissory note. The principal amount outstanding under each
such master note would increase or decrease depending upon the amount of borrowings. Such arrangements are often
employed to facilitate the sale of loan participations by the lending bank.
Unsecured promissory notes sold as New Commercial Paper would be issued in denominations of $100,000 or multiples
thereof with maturities of up to 270 days and would not be prepayable prior to maturity. New Commercial Paper would
be sold directly to one or more commercial paper dealers at a discount rate prevailing at the date of issuance for commercial
paper of comparable quality and of the particular maturity sold by other issuers of commercial paper. No fee or commission
would be payable by JCP&L, Met-Ed or Penelec in connection with their issuances and sales of New Commercial Paper.
The New Commercial Paper will be reoffered by the purchasing dealer or dealers to institutional investors at a discount
of not more than 1/8 of 1% per annum less than the prevailing discount rate to JCP&L, Met-Ed or Penelec. The commercial
paper dealers will offer and resell the New Commercial Paper to not more than a total of 200 of their respective customers,
identified and designated in a non-public list (``Closed List'') prepared by each such dealer in advance for this
purpose.
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec may also utilize the services of one or more commercial paper placement agents (``Placement
Agent'') through whom they would sell their New Commercial Paper directly to one or more institutional investors
included on the Placement Agent's Closed List (as it may be amended) which would not exceed 200 such investors. The
Placement Agent would arrange for the sale of New Commercial Paper and would be compensated for its services out of
the discount on the sale. No fee or other commission would be otherwise payable by JCP&L, Met-Ed or Penelec in connection
with the placement of their New Commercial Paper.
The GPU Companies further propose to issue, sell and renew from time to time their unsecured promissory notes evidencing
short-term borrowings from lenders such as commercial banks, insurance companies or other institutions. Such notes
would mature not later than nine months after the date of issue, bear interest at a rate (after giving effect to any fees
and compensating balance requirements) not in excess of the greater of 125% of (A) Such lender's or other recognized
prime rate and (B) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, would be prepayable only to the extent therein provided and
would not be issued as part of any public offering.

The proceeds from the issuance and sale of the unsecured promissory notes as proposed herein will be used by the GPU
Companies to finance their businesses, including, in the case of GPU, to finance the acquisition of securities of
EWGs and FUCOs.



Central and South West Services, Inc., et al. (70-8459)



Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and its service company subsidiary,
Central and South West Services, Inc. (``CSWS''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rogers Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75202,
have filed a declaration under Section 6(a), 7 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder.

CSWS proposes, through December 31, 1996, to refinance certain of its long-term assets (``Assets''), including
the CSW headquarters building located in Dallas, Texas (``Headquarters Building'') by borrowing up to $60 million
from one or more commercial banks and/or institutional lenders. The Assets, including the Headquarters Building,
are currently financed primarily through the CSW Money Pool (``Money Pool'').

CSWS and CSW propose to refinance the Assets either through a floating rate loan from a commercial bank or through a
fixed rate private placement of securities to institutional lenders. Bank borrowings will be evidenced by secured
or unsecured notes with maturities not exceeding 15 years and bear interest at not more than 100 basis points above
the LIBOR or similar rate. In connection with such floating rate borrowing, CSWS requests authority to enter into
interest rate swap agreements to obtain the benefits of fixed rate financing. Any swap agreements would provide that
the prepayment of the notes would terminate CSWS' obligations to its counterparty under the swap agreement. Institutional
borrowings will be evidenced by notes with maturities not exceeding 15 years and bear interest at a rate not expected
to exceed the effective cost of money from unsecured prime commercial rate loans prevailing on the date of such borrowings.
The choice between the financing alternatives will depend principally on market conditions.

Proceeds from the proposed borrowings will not be used to finance the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator
or a foreign utility company as defined in Section 32 and 33 of the Act.

As the sole holder of the outstanding common stock of CSWS and as an inducement to commercial banks or institutional
lenders to make loans to CSWS, it is contemplated that CSW may be required to guarantee the obligations of CSWS to the
lenders. Accordingly, CSW proposed to guarantee the payments due to lenders.



Alabama Power Company, et al. (70-8461)



Alabama Power Company, 600 North 18th Street, Birmingham, Alabama 35291 (``Alabama''), Georgia Power Company,
333 Piedmont Avenue, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30308 (``Georgia''), Gulf Power Company, 500 Bayfront Parkway, Pensacola,
Florida 32501 (``Gulf''), Mississippi Power Company, 2992 West Beach, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501 (``Mississippi''),
and Savannah Electric and Power Company, 600 Bay Street, East, Savannah, Georgia 31401 (``Savannah'') (collectively,
``Operating Companies''), electric public utility subsidiaries of the Southern Company, a registered holding
company, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and
54 thereunder.

Each Operating Company proposes to organize a separate special purpose subsidiary as either: (1) a limited liability
company (``LLC'') under the Limited Liability Company Act (``LLC Act''); or (2) a limited partnership (``LP'') under
the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (``LP Act'') of any state in which they respectively are organized to
do business or are incorporated, or of the State of Delaware or other jurisdiction considered advantageous by any
of the Operating Companies (``Special Purpose Subsidiaries''). In the event that any Operating Company organizes
its Special Purpose Subsidiary as either an LLC or an LP, it may also organize a second special purpose subsidiary under
the General Corporation Law of any state in which they respectively are organized to do business or are incorporated,
or of the State of Delaware or other jurisdiction, as the case may be (``Investment Sub''), for the respective purpose
of: (1) Acquiring and holding Special Purpose Subsidiary common stock so as to comply with the requirement under the
applicable LLC Act that a limited liability company have at least two members; and (2) acting as the general partner
of such Special Purpose Subsidiary and acquiring, either directly or indirectly through such Investment Sub, a limited
partnership interest in such Special Purpose Subsidiary to ensure that such Special Purpose Subsidiary will at all
times have a limited partner to the extent required by the applicable LP Act.

<PARENT> FR940930-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Special Purpose Subsidiaries then will issue and sell their preferred securities (``Preferred Securities''),
with a par or stated value or liquidation preference of up to $100 per security, at any time or from time-to-time, in
one or more series through December 31, 1997. The Preferred Securities will be sold by the respective Special Purpose
Subsidiaries in the following aggregate par or stated value or liquidation preference amounts: (1) Up to $175 million
in the case of Alabama; (2) up to $300 million in the case of Georgia; (3) up to $15 million in the case of Gulf; (4) up to
$15 million in the case of Mississippi; and (5) up to $10 million in the case of Savannah.
Each Operating Company and/or its respective Investment Sub will acquire all of the common stock or all of the general
partnership interests, as the case may be, of its Special Purpose Subsidiary for an amount up to 21% of the total equity
capitalization from time-to-time of such Special Purpose Subsidiary (``Equity Contribution''). Each Operating
Company may issue and sell to its Special Purpose Subsidiary, at any time or from time-to-time in one or more series,
subordinated debentures, promissory notes or other debt instruments (``Notes'') governed by an indenture or other
document, and the Special Purpose Subsidiary will apply both the Equity Contribution and the proceeds from the sale
of Preferred Securities to purchase Notes of such Operating Company. Alternatively, each Operating Company may
enter into a loan agreement or agreements with its Special Purpose Subsidiary under which it will loan to the Operating
Company (``Loans'') both the Equity Contribution and the proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Securities evidenced
by Notes. Each Operating Company may also guarantee (``Guaranties'') the payment of dividends or distributions
on the Preferred Securities, payments to the Preferred Securities holders of amounts due upon liquidation or redemption
of the Preferred Securities and certain additional amounts that may be payable regarding the Preferred Securities.
Each Note will have a term, including extensions, of up to 50 years. Prior to maturity, each Operating Company will
pay only interest on its Notes at a rate equal to the dividend or distribution rate on the related series of Preferred
Securities. The dividend or distribution rate may be either fixed or adjustable, determined on a periodic basis by
auction or remarketing procedures, in accordance with a formula or formulae based upon certain reference rates,
or by other predetermined methods. Such interest payments will constitute each Special Purpose Subsidiary's only
income and will be used by it to pay monthly dividends or distributions on the Preferred Securities issued by it and
dividends or distributions on the common stock or the general partnership interests of such Special Purpose Subsidiary.

<PARENT> FR940930-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Dividend payments or distributions on the Preferred Securities will be made monthly, will be cumulative and must
be made to the extent that funds are legally available. However, each Operating Company will have the right to defer
payment of interest on its Notes for up to five years, provided that if dividends or distributions on the Preferred
Securities of any series are not paid for up to 18 consecutive months, then the holders of the Preferred Securities
of such series may have the right to appoint a trustee, special general partner or other special representative to
enforce the Special Purpose Subsidiary's rights under the related Note and Guaranty. Each Special Purpose Subsidiary
will have the parallel right to defer dividend payments or distributions on the related series of Preferred Securities
for up to five years. The dividend or distribution rates, payment dates, redemption and other similar provisions
of each series of Preferred Securities will be substantially identical to the interest rates, payment dates, redemption
and other provisions of the related Note issued by the Operating Company.

The Notes and related Guaranties of each Operating Company will be subordinate to all other existing and future indebtedness
for borrowed money of such Operating Company and will have no cross-default provisions with respect to their indebtedness
of the Operating Company. However, each Operating company may not declare and pay dividends on its outstanding preferred
or common stock unless all payments due under its Notes and Guaranties have been made.

It is expected that each Operating Company's interest payments on the Notes issued by it will be deductible for federal
income tax purposes and that its Special Purpose Subsidiary will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes. Consequently, holders of the Preferred Securities will be deemed to have received partnership distributions
in respect of their dividends or distributions from the respective Special Purpose Subsidiary and will not be entitled
to any ``dividends received deduction'' under the Internal Revenue Code.

The Preferred Securities are optionally redeemable by the Special Purpose Subsidiary at a price equal to their par
or stated value or liquidation preference, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions, at any time after
a specified date not later than 10 years from their date of issuance or upon the occurrence of certain events. The Preferred
Securities of any series may also be subject to mandatory redemption upon the occurrence of certain events. Each Operating
Company also may have the right in certain cases to exchange the Preferred Securities of its Special Purpose Subsidiary
for the Notes or other junior subordinated debt of the Operating Company.

In the event that any Special Purpose Subsidiary is required to withhold or deduct certain amounts in connection with
dividend distribution or other payments, it may also have the obligation to ``gross up'' such payments so that the
holders of the Preferred Securities will receive the same payment after such withholding or deduction as they would
have received if no such withholding or deduction were required. In such event, the related Operating Company's obligations
under its Note and Guaranty may also cover such ``gross up'' obligation. In addition, if any Special Purpose Subsidiary
is required to pay taxes on income derived from interest payments on the Notes, the related Operating Company may be
required to pay additional interest equal to the tax payment. Each Operating Company, individually, expects to apply
the net proceeds of the Loans to the repayment of outstanding short-term debt, for construction purposes, and for
other general corporate purposes, including the redemption or other retirement of outstanding senior securities.



Columbus Southern Power Co, et al. (70-8463)



Columbus Southern Power Co. (``Columbus''), 215 North Front Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, an electric utility subsidiary
company of American Electric Power Co., Inc., a registered holding company, and Simco, Inc. (``Simco''), 215 North
Front Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a non-utility subsidiary company of Columbus, have filed a declaration under
Section 12(c) of the Act and Rule 42 thereunder.

Columbus and Simco request an authorization for Simco to return excess capital to Columbus through a declaration
of dividends on its common shares of stock out of paid-in capital surplus to be paid on a periodic basis until the amount
of dividends equals $500,000.

In an order dated June 5, 1987 (HCAR No. 24405), the Commission authorized Columbus to acquire a note from Peabody Coal
Company (``Peabody'') in connection with the sale of real property and fixed assets to Peabody. In consequence of
this transaction, the coal mining activities of Simco were transferred and almost all of its business operations
were discontinued.

In an order dated October 19, 1990 (HCAR No. 25174), the Commission authorized Simco to reduce the par value of its authorized
shares of common stock to $0.10 per share, to reduce the stated capital of its common stock from $9,000,000 to $9,000,
and to declare and pay to Columbus dividends out of paid-in capital up to $4.5 million.

Simco is a party to a May 1, 1991 agreement with Conesville Coal Preparation Co. (``Conesville''), a non-utility subsidiary
company of Columbus. Under the agreement, Conesville has a non-exclusive right to the use of a coal conveyor beltline,
through January 1, 2017, in exchange for a usage charge currently in the amount of approximately $38,000 per month.

In consequence of the above-described transactions and the cessation of all other business by Simco, Simco has cash
in excess of its foreseeable capital requirements. Simco currently has 90,000 shares of common stock, par value $.10
per share. On June 30, 1994, Simco had retained earnings of $111,338, paid-in capital of $740,000, a stated capital
of $9,000, and cash and temporary investments of $355,479.

Monthly usage charges under the agreement will continue for approximately twenty-two years. This amount together
with the current capital of Simco is far in excess of foreseeable capital needs. Therefore, it is proposed that excess
capital in an amount not to exceed $500,000 be distributed to Columbus.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Determination to Extend Emergency Restriction on Maya Artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala.







Pursuant to the authority vested in me under Executive Order 12555 and Delegation Order No. 86-3 of March 18,
1986 (51 FR 10137), 

I find: Pursuant to the requirements of Section 304(c)(3) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3), with respect to the extension
of an emergency import restriction on Maya artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala, and pursuant to the emergency
provisions under Section 304(a)(3); and pursuant to a favorable recommendation from the Cultural Property Advisory
Committee,_

(1) That the material is archaeological and is identifiable as part of the remains of the Maya civilization (approximately
1200 B.C.-1500 A.D) which developed a writing system and about which little is known except from limited scientific
excavation of intact remains; that pillage continues to exist relative to these remains of the Maya culture, the record
of which continues to be in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens
to be, of crisis proportions;

(2) That the application of the import restriction set forth on a temporary basis would continue, in whole or in part,
to reduce the incentive for pillage.



Determination



Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned authority vested in me, and pursuant to Section 304(c)(3) of the
Act, 19 U.S.C. 2603(c)(3), and consistent with a favorable recommendation from the Cultural Property Advisory Committee,
I determine:

(1) That the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to Maya artifacts from the Peten Region of Guatemala,

(2) That the emergency import restriction that went into effect on April 15, 1991, is extended for a period of three
more years effective October 3, 1994.

Changes to the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act National Master List



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Fire Administration, FEMA.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) gives notice of additions and corrections/changes to,
and deletions from, the national master list of places of public accommodations which meet the fire prevention and
control guidelines under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Acting under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2201 note, the United States Fire Administration
has worked with each State to compile a national master list of all of the places of public accommodation affecting
commerce located in each State that meet the requirements of the guidelines under the Act. FEMA published the national
master list in the 

Federal Register

 on Tuesday, November 29, 1993, 58 FR 62718, and published changes approximately monthly since then.



Parties wishing to be added to the National Master List, or to make any other change, should contact the State office
or official responsible for compiling listings of properties which comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act.
A list of State contacts was published in 58 FR 17020 on March 31, 1993. If the published list is unavailable to you, the
State Fire Marshal's office can direct you to the appropriate office. Periodically FEMA will update and redistribute
the national master list to incorporate additions and corrections/changes to the list, and deletions from the list,
that are received from the State offices.

Each update contains or may contain three categories: ``Additions;'' ``Corrections/changes;'' and ``Deletions.''
For the purposes of the updates, the three categories mean and include the following:

``Additions'' are either names of properties submitted by a State but inadvertently omitted from the initial master
list or names of properties submitted by a State after publication of the initial master list;

``Corrections/changes'' are corrections to property names, addresses or telephone numbers previously published
or changes to previously published information directed by the State, such as changes of address or telephone numbers,
or spelling corrections; and

``Deletions'' are entries previously submitted by a State and published in the national master list or an update to
the national master list, but subsequently removed from the list at the direction of the State.

Copies of the national master list and its updates may be obtained by writing to the Government Printing Office, Superintendent
of Documents, Washington, DC 20402-9325. When requesting copies please refer to stock number 069-001-00049-1.

The update to the national master list follows below.

 Supplemental Notice for GNMA Multiclass Securities Program. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In its May 26, 1994 

Federal Register

 Notice, the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'') implemented a new program under which GNMA would
guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed securities. The Notice provided for implementation in two stages, the initial
stage and the full participation stage. With the completion of the initial stage, GNMA is now commencing the full participation
stage of its multiclass securities program. The program is intended to benefit borrowers using federally insured
or guaranteed mortgages by increasing investment demand for GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'')
that are backed by these mortgages, thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and raise revenues through
the receipt of guarantee and other fees by GNMA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



GNMA published a Notice in the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27290) (``May 26 Notice'') which implemented a new program under which GNMA guarantees real estate
mortgage investment conduits (``REMICs''). GNMA began its program with an ``initial stage''. During the initial
stage, participation was limited to firms selected through a Competitive Application Procedure (``CAP''), standard
documents were drafted, internal control procedures and information gathering and retention processes were developed,
and a Multiclass Securities Guide was produced. This Guide will be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the
policies governing the program, in accordance with usual GNMA procedures, and consistent with any regulations established
for the program. 

GNMA received two comments regarding participation by minority and women-owned firms, both of which recommended
that GNMA mandate participation by minority and women-owned businesses. GNMA considered these comments in the development
of its policy as discussed below in section IV. One of these comments also recommended that GNMA pay the transaction
costs from its guaranty fee. GNMA has decided not to take this approach, for the reasons discussed in section II. 

GNMA is now commencing the full participation stage, which GNMA is implementing with the publication of this Notice.
Changes in GNMA's multiclass securities program are noted in this Notice. Any provisions in the May 26 Notice that
are not revised in this Notice remain in full force and effect. 



II. Program Revisions for Full Participation Stage 



A. Types of Eligible Securities 



For the full participation stage, GNMA is expanding its multiclass securities program to include multiclass securities
in addition to those issued by trusts electing REMIC status. Section 306(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.
1721(g)), authorizes GNMA to guarantee ``securities . . . based on or backed by a trust or pool composed
of mortgages. * * *'' This language does not limit GNMA to any specific type of security so long as it
is based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of eligible mortgages. In addition, section 3004 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which revised GNMA's statutory provisions relating to guaranty fees, referred to fees
charged for GNMA's guaranty of ``multiclass securities backed by a trust or pool of securities or notes guaranteed
by the Association under this subsection. * * *'' 



B. Sponsors 



GNMA is willing to undertake a variety of transactions, provided that GNMA determines in its sole discretion that
they enhance the goals of the program and provide protection against any loss to GNMA for which it would not otherwise
be responsible. 

The obligations of Sponsors with respect to any particular type of GNMA multiclass securities transaction will be
established from time to time by GNMA and will be set forth in the Multiclass Securities Guide. In general: 

1. Sponsors are required to demonstrate their capacity to accumulate those MBS needed for a securities issuance as
to which GNMA has committed to issue its guaranty. 

2. Sponsors are required to represent the structural integrity of the issuance under all cash flow scenarios and demonstrate
to GNMA's satisfaction their ability to indemnify GNMA for a breach of this representation. Sponsors are required
to have sufficient assets to back their representations and commitments to GNMA, as specifically set forth in the
GNMA Multiclass Securities Guide.

3. For transactions involving the distribution of multiclass securities in a public offering, the Sponsors are responsible
for assuring that distribution will be by licensed broker-dealers in good standing under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934. 

GNMA requires entities wishing to participate in this program as Sponsors to provide GNMA with certain information
and meet certain requirements. Currently, a Sponsor must have minimum capital assets of $250 million in shareholders'
equity, evidenced by the Sponsor's most recent audited financial statements. GNMA also requires that Sponsors have
had at least one REMIC transaction with the Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') or the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC''). If an entity that wishes to sponsor GNMA guaranteed transactions has not
had this experience, GNMA requires an alternative demonstration of experience, as GNMA determines appropriate.
A computer bulletin board, gREX, will be used to announce revisions to this policy. 

Entities that would like to obtain application forms or obtain further information should contact Chemical New York,
Inc., 1325 G St., N.W., Suite 640, Washington, D.C. 20005. 


C. Selection of Trustee 



GNMA has determined that the safety, integrity and efficiency of the multiclass securities program will be best served
if a limited number of institutions act as trustee. In making this determination, GNMA was particularly mindful of
the long-term obligations associated with acting as trustee for multiclass securities. 

To secure trustee services, GNMA has requested applications from qualified institutional trustees under a CAP.
In the meantime, the trustees approved for the initial stage will continue to serve as trustees for multiclass securities
transactions. Trustee services must include tax administration as well as customary securities administrative
and payment functions. Trustees approved pursuant to the CAP will be authorized to serve with respect to securities
issued during the period (not more than five years) specified in the request for applications. Once a trustee is assigned
to a specific transaction, it will continue to act as trustee for the life of the security, unless removed in accordance
with the Trust Agreement. Sponsors will use trustees approved pursuant to the CAP. Trustees will be paid from funds
related to the transaction. 


D. Trust Counsel and Accounting Firms 



Trust counsel selected by the Sponsor will provide customary securities and tax opinions on the transactions, in
accordance with GNMA's requirements. 

Accounting firms selected by the Sponsor will perform customary procedures with respect to financial information
included in the offering documents and as part of the closing process, in accordance with GNMA's requirements. GNMA
currently requires entities wishing to participate in GNMA guaranteed transactions to submit certain information
to GNMA. Interested parties may obtain the appropriate forms from Chemical New York, Inc. (``Chemical Bank'') at
the address set out in section II.B. above. 


E. The Guaranty Fee 



GNMA will (1) make such multiclass guaranty fee adjustments as it determines, in GNMA's sole discretion, to be appropriate
to fulfill the objectives of the program, and (2) establish and adjust from time to time such guaranty fees as it determines
to be appropriate for other types of multiclass securities transactions in accordance with the objectives of the
program. Guaranty fees and changes in guaranty fees will be announced on gREX (described below). 


F. Information Distribution System (gREX)

GNMA has established a multiclass securities bulletin board, named ``gREX'', which is operated by GNMA's Information
Agent, which at present is Chemical Bank. Financial information and offering circular disclosure information for
multiclass securities transactions will be posted on gREX. Interested parties may obtain gREX software by contacting
Chemical Bank at 1-800-2341-REX, or at the address set out in section II.B. above. Users must pay
for their connect time and software. 


G. Eligible MBS 



The May 26, 1994 Notice identified eligible MBS as GNMA I MBS backed by single family mortgages that were issued on or
after February 1, 1993. GNMA intends to expand the program to include other MBS and perhaps other securities. Announcements
of additional eligible securities will be made on gREX. 


H. Distribution Date 



With the expansion of eligible collateral and securities, GNMA may vary the distribution date, referred to as the
``Payment Date'' in the May 26, 1994 Notice, based on the type of multiclass transaction. Announcements of any changes
in the distribution date of multiclass securities will be made on gREX. 


I. Transaction Expenses 



During the initial stage, GNMA had no liability for payment of any fees or expenses, other than those of GNMA's Legal
Advisor, in connection with the GNMA guaranty of multiclass securities. One comm
