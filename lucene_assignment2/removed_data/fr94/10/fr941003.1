OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS











Freedom of Information Act Rules and Schedule of Fees for the Production of Public Financial Disclosure Reports



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Government Ethics (OGE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Government Ethics is issuing a proposed rule to establish procedures for the implementation of the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA). The rule also proposes to establish a schedule of fees which will be charged for the reproduction
and mailing of public financial disclosure reports (SF 278s).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, requires every agency to promulgate regulations implementing certain
of its provisions. On October 1, 1989, the Office of Government Ethics, formerly part of the Office of Personnel Management,
was established as a separate executive branch agency and is therefore proposing to adopt this rule incorporating
many of its existing practices for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended by the Freedom
of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570). This rule would also implement the Guidelines for a uniform
Freedom of Information Act fee schedule published by the Office of Management and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012)
and the Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987.
Subpart G of the rule proposes to establish a separate schedule of fees for the reproduction and mailing of public financial
disclosure reports requested pursuant to section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended.

Subpart A of the proposed rule contains general provisions describing the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act
and its coverage. Section 2604.102 describes the types of records to which the Freedom of Information Act applies,
and the relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The proposed rule also provides that
if another statute, such as the Ethics Act, sets forth procedures for the disclosure of specific types of records,
the Office will process a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific
records. However, in cases where the record is not required to be released under the specific procedures set forth
in another statute, the Office will consider the request under FOIA.
Section 2604.102 as proposed also explains that records which are available through an established distribution
system (for example, the National Technical Information Service) should preferably be obtained through that system,
rather than pursuant to the provisions of the FOIA. The terms frequently used in the rule are defined in proposed  2604.104.


II. Public Reading Room


Subpart B of the proposed rule describes the location of OGE's public reading room and the materials available there.
The subpart would also set forth the indexing requirements as to any records OGE maintains which are required to be
indexed under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Proposed  2604.202 contains the Director's determination that, because
of OGE's size and the relatively small number of requests for records required to be indexed, such indexes do not need
to be published quarterly.


III. Production and Disclosure of Records Under FOIA


Subpart C as proposed contains detailed rules of procedure for requesting records under FOIA. It also describes the
format to which OGE will adhere in responding to these requests.
Requests for OGE records have generally been directed to the Office of the General Counsel. Since this approach is
administratively practical, this system is being proposed for codification. Proposed  2604.301 states that
requests for records should be addressed to the General Counsel of OGE. Requesters will generally be required to submit
FOIA requests in writing. Each request should contain sufficient detail to allow the Office to locate the record with
a reasonable amount of effort. If a request is too broad or too vague to allow the Office to locate the record with a reasonable
amount of effort, the Office would assist the requester in revising the request as appropriate.
The filing of a request would be deemed to constitute an agreement to pay any applicable fees up to $25.00, unless a waiver
were sought. The request could also specify a limit on fees the requester is willing to pay.
The General Counsel of OGE, or his designee, has been delegated responsibility in proposed  2604.302 to grant
or deny requests and to determine appropriate fees.
Consistent with the terms of proposed  2604.302(b), OGE will ordinarily refer FOIA requests for records that
originated in another Government agency to the other agency for response. In such cases, the requester will be notified
of the referral. Section 2604.302(c) as proposed specifies that, in cases where a requester asks for a record in a format
which does not currently exist, OGE will provide whatever records reasonably respond to the request, but will not
create a new record in order to respond. Under  2604.302(d) of the proposed rule, if a record cannot be located
from the information supplied, the General Counsel will so inform the requester.
Proposed  2604.303 requires the General Counsel to notify a requester in writing of the determination to grant
a request in whole or in part. The response must describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed and inform
the requester of any fees which will be charged. Similarly, the General Counsel's determination to deny a request
in whole or in part must be made in writing and signed by the General Counsel (or his designee). Consistent with  2604.303(b)
as proposed, any denial is to contain a brief statement describing the basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemptions
which were relied upon. Moreover, the denial must state that requesters have a right to appeal and must explain OGE's
appeal procedures.
The Office's appeal procedures are set forth in  2604.304 of the proposed rule. Denials may be appealed to OGE's
Deputy Director within 30 days after receipt of a denial letter. Appeals must be in writing and must contain reasons
or arguments in support of disclosure. The Office will respond to appeals in writing, and will specify the reason for
affirming any original denial. When a denial is reversed in whole or in part, the request for disclosure will be processed
promptly. The decision on appeal is the Office's final action on a request. Requesters have a right to seek judicial
review of the action under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
Section 2604.305 of the proposed rule describes the time limits to which the Office will adhere in responding to requests.
The time limits may be extended up to a total of 10 working days in unusual circumstances, i.e., when the records are
in a location other than the Office, the request is for a large number of records, or the Office must consult with another
agency or consult with various OGE components.

IV. Exemptions Under FOIA




The Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions from its mandatory disclosure provisions. These exemptions
permit an agency to withhold a requested record in certain circumstances. Section 2604.401 in subpart D of the proposed
rule generally references the nine classes of records that may be exempted from disclosure under FOIA. Proposed  2604.401(a)
states that OGE will not withhold a requested record unless it falls within a FOIA exemption and that in deciding whether
to withhold material, OGE will consider whether another statute, Executive order or regulation prohibits release
or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold it. Further, under proposed  2604.401(b),
the Office with withhold information which falls within an exemption if the information was furnished on a pledge
of confidentiality authorized by statute, Executive order or regulation.


Section 2604.401(c) also provides that certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes may not be subject
to the requirement of FOIA. Additionally, proposed  2604.401(d) provides for partial application of the exemptions
to a record.


Proposed  2604.402 contains OGE's procedures for disclosure of business information provided to the Office.
Generally,  2604.402 would require submitters of business information to designate those portions of their
submissions they believe may be exempt from disclosure under any exemption of the FOIA. If records so designated are
subsequently requested under FOIA, in most cases the submitter will have an opportunity to provide a written objection
to disclosure.




V. Fees




Subpart E of the proposed rule contains provisions relating to the fees which will be assessed for services rendered
in responding to and processing requests for records under FOIA. Fees are to be based on the type of service provided
(e.g., search, review, duplication) as well as the category of person making the request (e.g., commercial user,
educational institution, news media). Generally, commercial requesters will pay the full amount of permissible
fees; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and news media will pay only duplication costs. As
a matter of policy, OGE will not change fees for any individual request if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Additionally,
under the proposal OGE may furnish records without charge or at a reduced charge where disclosure of the requested
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of
the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In
making this determination, OGE will apply the factors suggested by the Department of Justice in the Attorney General's
Memorandum on the 1986 Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act dated December, 1987. These factors have been
incorporated in proposed  2604.503.


Section 2604.504 as proposed contains a number of miscellaneous provisions concerning fees, including a requirement
that requesters pay in advance fees likely to exceed $250.00. However, advance payment may not be required in the case
of a requester who has a history of prompt payment.




VI. Annual Report to Congress




On or before March 15 of each year, the Office sends a report of OGE's FOIA activities for the prior calendar year to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. Section 2604.602 of the proposed rule lists
the information included in this annual report.




VII. Fees for the Production and Mailing of Public Financial Disclosure Reports

<DOCNO> FR941003-1-00005 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 105(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, requires an agency, with certain limited exceptions,
to make available to the public any public financial disclosure report (SF 278) filed with the agency. Section 105(b)(1)
permits an agency to charge a fee adequate to recover the cost of reproduction and mailing of a public financial disclosure
report (SF 278) requested by any person in accordance with the requirements of section 105. However, the fee may not
include any charge attributable to the salary of any employee involved in the reproduction or mailing of these reports.
To implement this provision for such reports filed with it, OGE is proposing to create a fee structure separate from
the FOIA fee structure set forth in subpart E of this proposed rule. Proposed subpart G contains provisions to implement
this authority.
Section 2604.702 as proposed provides that public financial disclosure reports will be furnished upon payment of
$.03 per page and the actual direct cost of mailing. The $.03 per page charge includes the actual cost of the paper used
and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. It does not include any overhead charges (such as lighting and heat),
nor does it include the salary of any employee involved in operating a duplicating machine. No change will be made for
individual requests if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Proposed  2604.702(d) specifically provides
that the miscellaneous fee provisions in  2604.504 of subpart E will apply to requests for public financial
disclosure reports (SF 278s). However, no other provisions in subpart E concerning fees, fee waivers, and fee reductions
apply to requests for public financial disclosure reports.


Executive Order 12866


In promulgating this proposed rule, the Office of Government Ethics has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and
the applicable principles of regulations set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and
Review. This proposed regulation has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


As Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I certify under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6)
that this proposed regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply to this proposed regulation because it does not contain
information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.

 2604.102


Applicability.


(a) 

General. 

The FOIA and this rule apply to all OGE records. However, if another law sets forth procedures for the disclosure of
specific types of records, such as section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. appendix, OGE will process
a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific records. See 5 CFR 2634.603
and subpart G of this part. If there is any record which is not required to be released under those provisions, OGE will
consider the request under the FOIA and this rule, provided that the special Ethics Act access procedures cited must
be complied with as to any record within the scope thereof.
(b) 

The relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974. 

The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, applies to records that are about individuals, but only if the records are in
a system of records as defined in the Privacy Act. Requests from individuals for records about themselves which are
contained in an OGE system of records will be processed under the provision of the Privacy Act as well as the FOIA. OGE
will not deny access by a first party to a record under the FOIA or the Privacy Act unless the record is not available to
that individual under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA.
(c) 

Records available through routine distribution procedures. 

When the record requested includes material published and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office) or which is available to the public through an established distribution system (such
as that of the National Technical Information Service of the Department of Commerce), OGE will instead explain how
the record may be obtained through those channels.


 2604.103

Definitions.


As used in this part,
(a) 

Agency 

has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 551(1) and 5 U.S.C. 552(f).
(b) 

Business information 

means trade secrets or other commercial or financial information, provided to the Office by a submitter, which arguably
is protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act.
(c) 

Business submitter 

means any person who provides business information, directly or indirectly, to the Office and who has a proprietary
interest in the information.
(d) 

Commercial use 

means, when referring to a request, that the request is from, or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose
that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or of a person on whose behalf the request
is made. Whether a request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request and the use to which the records
will be put. When a request is from a representative of the news media, a purpose or use supporting the requester's news
dissemination function is not a commercial use.
(e) 

Direct costs 

means those expenditures actually incurred in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requesters,
reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work
and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs
of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.
(f) 

Duplication

 means the process of making a copy of a record. Such copies include paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials,
and magnetic tapes, cards, and discs.
(g) 

Educational institution

Office 

or 

OGE 

means the United States Office of Government Ethics.
(m) 

Person 

has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 551(2).
(n) 

Records 

means any handwritten, typed, or printed documents (such as memoranda, books, brochures, studies, writings, drafts,
letters, transcripts, and minutes) and documentary material in other forms (such as punchcards, magnetic tapes,
cards or discs, paper tapes, audio or video recordings, maps, photographs, slides, microfilm and motion pictures)

Subpart B_Public Reading Room and Index Identifying Information for the Public



 2604.201 

Public reading room.



(a) 

Location of public reading room.

 The Office of Government Ethics maintains a public reading room at its offices located at 1201 New York Avenue, NW.,
Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005-3917. Persons desiring to utilize the reading room should contact the Office,
in writing or by telephone at (202) 523-5757 or FAX (202) 523-6325, to arrange a time to inspect the materials
available there.

(b) 

Records available.

 The Office of Government Ethics public reading room contains OGE records which are required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)
to be made available for public inspection and copying, including:

(1) Any final opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
(2) Any statements of policy and interpretation which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the 

Federal Register

;
(3) Any administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public, and which are not
exempt from disclosure under section (b) of the FOIA; and

(4) Current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter which was issued, adopted or
promulgated after July 4, 1967, and is required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) to be made available or published.

(c) 

Copying.

 The cost of copying information available in OGE's public reading room shall be imposed on a requester in accordance
with the provisions of subpart E of this part.



 2604.202 

Index identifying information for the public.



(a) The Office of Government Ethics will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying a current index
of the materials available at its public reading room which are required to be indexed under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2).

(b) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics has determined that it is unnecessary and impracticable to publish
quarterly or more frequently and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index and supplements thereto,
as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). The Office will provide copies of such indexes upon request, at a cost not to exceed
the direct cost of duplication and mailing, if sending records by other than ordinary mail.



Subpart C_Production and Disclosure of Records Under FOIA



 2604.301 

Requests for records.



(a) 

Addressing requests.

 Requests for copies of records may be made in person or by telephone, (202) 523-5757, during normal business
hours at the Office of Government Ethics, 1201 New York Avenue NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005-3917 or by
mail addressed to the General Counsel of OGE. Although oral requests may be honored, a requester generally will be
asked to submit his request under the FOIA in writing. In the case of a written request, the envelope containing the
request and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request.

(b) 

Description of records.

 Each request must reasonably describe the desired records in sufficient detail to enable Office personnel to locate
the records with a reasonable amount of effort. A request for a specific category of records will be regarded as fulfilling
this requirement if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably
burdensome or disruptive of Office operations.

(1) Wherever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date,
title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record.

(2) If the General Counsel determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, he will either
advise the requester what additional information is needed to locate the record, or otherwise state why the request
is insufficient. The General Counsel will also extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with Office personnel
with the objective of reformulating the request in a manner which will meet the requirements of this section.

<PARENT> FR941003-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Agreement to pay fees. 

The filing of a request under this subpart will be deemed to constitute an agreement by the requester to pay all applicable
fees charged under subpart E of this part, up to $25.00, unless a waiver of fees is sought. The request may also specify
a limit on the amount the requester is willing to spend, or may indicate a willingness to pay an amount greater than $25.00,
if applicable. In cases where a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to more that $25.00,
the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee.


(d) 

Requests for records relating to corrective actions. 

No record developed pursuant to the authority of 5 U.S.C. app. 402(f)(2) concerning the investigation of an employee
for a possible violation of any provision relating to a conflict of interest shall be made available pursuant to this
part unless the request for such information identifies the employee to whom the records relate and the subject matter
of any alleged violation to which the records relate. Nothing in this subsection shall affect the application of subpart
D of this part to any record so identified. 



 2604.302 

Response to requests. 



(a) 

Response to initial request. 

The General Counsel is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record and to determine appropriate fees. 

(b) 

Referral to another agency. 

When a requester seeks records that originated in another Government agency, OGE will normally refer the request
to the other agency for response. If OGE refers the request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral.
If release of certain records may adversely affect United States relations with foreign governments, the Office
will usually consult with the Department of State. A request for any records classified by some other agency will be
referred to that agency for response. 

(c) 

Creating records. 

If a person seeks information from OGE in a format that does not currently exist, OGE will not ordinarily reformat the
information for the purpose of responding to the request. OGE will advise the requester that it does not have the record
in the format sought, but will provide whatever records in existing formats that would reasonably respond to the request.
Additionally, OGE will not generally develop a new record of information to satisfy a request. 

(d) 

Record cannot be located. 

If a requested record cannot be located from the information supplied, the General Counsel will so notify the requester
in writing. 



 2604.303 

Form and content of responses. 



(a) 

Form of notice granting a request. 

After the General Counsel has made a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, the requester will be notified
in writing. The notice shall describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed, whether by providing a copy
of the record with the response or at a later date, or by making a copy of the record available to the requester for inspection
at a reasonable time and place. The procedure for such an inspection may not unreasonably disrupt the operations of
the Office. The response letter will also inform the requester with the provisions of subpart E of this part. 

(b) 

Form of notice denying a request. 

When the General Counsel denies a request in whole or in part, he will so notify the requester in writing. The response
will be signed by the General Counsel and will include: 

(1) The name and title or position of the person making the denial; 

(2) A brief statement of the reason or reasons for the denial, including the FOIA exemption or exemptions which the
General Counsel has relied upon in denying the request; and 

(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under  2604.304 of this subpart, and a description of the requirements
of that section. 



 2604.304 

Appeal of denials. 



(a) 

Right of appeal. 

If a request has been denied in whole or in part, the requester may appeal the denial to the Deputy Director of the Office
of Government Ethics, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005-3917. 

(b) 

Letter of appeal. 

The appeal must be in writing and must be sent within 30 days of receipt of the denial letter. An appeal should include
a copy of the initial request, a copy of the letter denying the request in whole or in part, and a statement of the circumstances,
reasons or arguments advanced in support of disclosure of the request for the record. Both the envelope and the letter
of appeal must be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.'' 

(c) 

Action on appeal.

 The disposition of an appeal will be in writing and will constitute the final action of the Office on a request. A decision
affirming in whole or in part the denial of a request will include a brief statement of the reason or reasons for affirmance,
including each FOIA exemption relied on. If the denial of a request is reversed in whole or in part on appeal, the request
will be processed promptly in accordance with the decision on appeal. 

(d) 

Judicial review. 

If the denial of the request for records is upheld in whole or in part, the Office will notify the person making the request
of his right to seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).

(a) 

Initial request. 

Following receipt of a request for records, the General Counsel will determine whether to comply with the request
and will notify the requester in writing of his determination within 10 working days.
(b) 

Appeal.

 A written determination on a appeal submitted in accordance with  2604.304 of this subpart will be issued within
20 working days after receipt of the appeal.
(c) 

Extension of time limits.

 The time limits specified in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be extended in unusual circumstances up
to a total of 10 working days, after written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and
the date on which a determination is expected to be made. As used in this paragraph, 

unusual circumstances

 means that there is a need to:
(1) Search for and collect records from archives;
(2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are
demanded in a single request; or
(3) Consult with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or consult with
various OGE components that have substantial subject matter interest in the records requested.


Subpart D_Exemptions under FOIA


 2604.401

Policy.


(a) 

Policy on application of exemptions.

 Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records.
A requested record will not be withheld from inspection or copying unless it comes within one of the classes of records
exempted by 5 U.S.C. 552. In making its determination on withholding, OGE will consider whether another statute,
Executive order or regulation prohibits release or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold
material which is otherwise exempt under FOIA.
(b) 

Pledge of confidentiality.

 Information obtained from any individual or organization, furnished in reliance on a provision for confidentiality
authorized by applicable statute, Executive order or regulation, will not be disclosed to the extent it can be withheld
under one of the exemptions. However, this paragraph does not itself authorized the giving of any pledge of confidentiality
by any officer or employee of the Office of Government Ethics.
(c) 

Exception for law enforcement information.

 The Office may treat records compiled for law enforcement purposes as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom
of Information Act when:
(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law;
(2) There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is unaware of its pendency; and
(3) The disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably by expected to interfere with the enforcement
proceedings.
(d) 

Partial application of exemptions.

 Any reasonably segregable portion of a record will be provided to any person requesting the record after deletion
of the portions which are exempt under this subpart.


 2604.402

Business information.


(a) 

In general.

 Business information provided to the Office of Government Ethics by a submitter will not be disclosed pursuant to
a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section.
(b) 

Designation of business information.

 Submitters of business information should use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either
at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to
be protected under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted
to the Government, unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period
of longer duration.
(c) 

Predisclosure notification.

 The General Counsel will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request regarding its business information
if:
(1) The information has been designated by the submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under Exemption
4 of the FOIA; or
(2) The General Counsel has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption
4 of the FOIA.
Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies
of the records containing the business information. The requester also shall be notified that notice and an opportunity
to object are being provided to a submitter.
(d) 

Opportunity to object to disclosure.

 A submitter has five working days from receipt of the predisclosure notification to provide a written statement of
any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all the grounds for withholding any of the information
under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is deemed to be
a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided
by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(e) 

Notice of intent to disclose.

 The General Counsel will consider all objections raised by a submitter and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior
to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the General Counsel decides to disclose business
information over the objection of a submitter, he will send the submitter a written notice at least 10 working days
before the date of disclosure containing:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941003-1-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) A statement of the reasons why the submitter's objections were not sustained;

(2) A copy of the records which will be disclosed or a written description of the records; and

(3) A specified disclosure date. The requester shall also be notified of the General Counsel's determination to disclose
records over a submitter's objections.

(f) 

Notice of FOIA lawsuit.

 Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information, the General counsel shall
promptly notify the submitter.

(g) 

Exceptions to predisclosure notification.

 The notice requirements in paragraph (c) of this section do not apply if:

(1) The General Counsel determines that the information should not be disclosed;

(2) The information has been published previously or has been officially made available to the public;

(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or

(4) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous;
except that, in such a case, the General Counsel will provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision
to disclose business information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.



Subpart E_Schedule of Fees



 2604.501 

Fees to be charged_general.



(a) 

Policy.

 Fees shall be assessed according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section and the category of requesters
described in  2604.502 for services rendered in responding to and processing requests for records under subpart
C of this part. All fees shall be charged to the requester, except where the charging of fees is limited under  2604.503
(a) and (b) or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under  2604.503(c). Requesters shall pay fees by
check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

(b) 

Types of charges.

 The types of charges that may be assessed in connection with the production of records in response to a FOIA request
are as follows:

(1) 

Searches

_

(i) 

Manual searches for records.

 Whenever feasible, the office will charge at the salary rate (i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee making the search.
However, where a homogeneous class of personnel is used exclusively in a search (e.g., all clerical time or all professional
time) the Office will charge $10.00 per hour for clerical time and $20.00 per hour for professional time. Charges for
search time will be billed by fifteen minute segments.

(ii) 

Computer searches for records.

 Requesters will be charged the actual direct cost of conducting a search using existing programming. These direct
costs shall include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly
attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, as well as the cost of operator/programmer salary
apportionable to the search. The Office will not alter or develop programming to conduct a search.

(iii) 

Unproductive searches.

 The Office will charge search fees even if no records are found which are responsive to the request, of if the records
found are exempt from disclosure.

(2) 

Duplication.

 The standard copying charge for documents in paper copy is $.15 per page. When responsive information is provided
in a format other than paper copy, such as in the form of computer tapes and discs, the requester may be charged the direct
costs of the tape, disc, or whatever medium is used to produce the information, as well as any related reproduction
costs.

(3) 

Review.

 Costs associated with the review of documents, as defined in  2604.104(q), will be charged at the salary rate
(i.e., basic pay plus 16%) of the employee conducting the review. Except as noted below, charges may be assessed only
for review at the initial level, i.e., the review undertaken the first time the documents are analyzed to determine
the applicability of specific exemptions to a particular record or portion of the records. A requester will not be
charged for review at the administrative appeal level concerning the applicability of an exemption already applied
at the initial level. However, when a record has been withheld pursuant to an exemption which is subsequently determined
not to apply and the record is reviewed again at the appeal level to determine the potential applicability of other
exemptions, the costs of such additional review may be assessed.

(4) 

Other services and materials.

 Where the Office elects, as a matter of administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special service or
materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or sending records by special methods, the actual direct
costs of providing the service or materials will be charged.



 2604.502 

Fees to be charged_categories of requesters.



(a) 

Fees for various requester categories.

 The paragraphs below state, for each category of requester, the type of fees generally charged by the Office. However,
for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived or reduced in accordance with the provisions set forth
in  2604.503. In determining whether a requester belongs in any of the following categories, the Office will
determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the Office has reasonable cause to doubt
the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, the
Office will seek clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

(b) 

Commercial use requester.

 The Office will charge the full costs of search, review, and duplication. Commercial use requesters are not entitled
to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction as described in  2604.503(a); however, the
de minimis fees provision of  2604.503(b) does apply to such requesters.

(c) 

Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and news media.

 If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated for scholarly
or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial use, the Office
will charge only for duplication of documents, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.

<PARENT> FR941003-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) 

All other requesters. 

If the request is not one described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Office will charge the full and direct
costs of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, excluding the first 100 pages of
duplication and the first two hours of search time. 



 2604.503 

Limitations on charging fees. 



(a) 

In general. 

Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use as described in  2604.502(b), the Office will provide,
without charge, the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time, or their cost equivalent.


(b) 

De minimis fees. 

The Office will not assess fees for individual requests if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. 

(c) 

Waiver or reduction of fees. 

Records responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 will be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the
Office determines, based upon information provided by a requester in support of a fee waiver request, that disclosure
of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of
the requester. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

(1) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, the Office will consider the following
factors: 

(i) 

The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of
the Government. 

The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically and directly concern
identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their
information value with respect to those Government operations or activities; 

(ii) 

The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the information is likely to contribute to an understanding
of Government operations or activies. 

The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully information on specific Government operations
or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increased public understanding of those operations
and activities. The disclosure of information which is already in the public domain, in either a duplicative or substantially
identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public
record; 

(iii) 

The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure
of the requested information will contribute to public understanding. 

The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding
of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons. A requester's identity and qualifications e.g., expertise
in the subject area and ability and intention to convey information to the general public_will be considered; and


(iv) 

The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of Government operations or activities. 

The public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing
prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be significantly enhanced by the disclosure. 

(2) In determining whether disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of
the requester, the Office will consider the following factors: 

(i) 

The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would
be furthered by the requested disclosure. 

The Office will consider all commercial interests of the requester, or any person on whose behalf the requester may
be acting, which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercial
interests, consideration will be given to the effect that the information disclosed would have on those commercial
interests; and 

(ii) 

The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester
is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester. 

A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where the public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude
than the requester's commercial interest in disclosure. The Office will ordinarily presume that, where a news media
requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be served primarily by disclosure
to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers and others who compile and market Government information for direct
economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest. 

(3) Where only a portion of the requested record satisfies the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under
this paragraph, a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion. 

(4) A request for a waiver or reduction of fees must accompany the request for disclosure of records, and should include:


(i) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the documents; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941003-1-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The proposed use of the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;

(iii) A statement of how the public will benefit from release of the requested documents; and

(iv) If specialized use of the documents is contemplated, a statement of the requester's qualifications that are
relevant to the specialized use.

(5) A requester may appeal the denial of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees in accordance with the provisions
of  2604.304.



 2604.504

Miscellaneous fee provisions.



(a) 

Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.

 Where the Office determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section may amount to more than $25.00,
the Office shall notify the requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of fees, unless the requester
has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Where a requester has been notified
that the actual or estimated fees may exceed $25.00, the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester
has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice to the requester pursuant to this paragraph will include the opportunity
to confer with Office personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

(b) 

Aggragating requests.

 A requester may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents in order to avoid the payment
of fees. Where there is reason to believe that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to
divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Office may aggregate
the requests and charge accordingly. The Office will presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day
period have been made in order to evade fees. Multiple requests regarding unrelated matters will not be aggregated.

(c) 

Advance payments.

 An advance payment before work is commenced or continued will not be required unless:

(1) The Office estimates or determines that the total fee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00.
When a determination is made that the allowable charges are likely to exceed $250.00, the requester will be notified
of the likely cost and will be required to provide satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a
history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or will be required to submit an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated
charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or

(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the
billing). In such cases the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided
by paragraph (e) of this section, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Office
begins to process a new request.

(3) When the Office requests an advance payment of fees, the administrative time limits described in subsection (a)(6)
of the FOIA will begin to run only after the Office has received the advance payment.

(d) 

Billing and payment.

 Normally the Office will require a requester to pay all fees before furnishing the requested records. However, the
Office may send a bill along with, or following the furnishing of records, in cases where the requester has a history
of prompt payment.

(e) 

Interest charges.

 Interest charges on an unpaid bill may be assessed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was
sent. Interest shall be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the date of billing. To collect
unpaid bills, the Office will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-365) including
the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

Administrative Remedy Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Justice. 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is proposing to revise its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program.
These regulations describe the process through which inmates may seek formal review of any issue related to their
confinement. The proposed changes are deemed necessary in order to attend to increased numbers of remedy requests
occasioned by the continued growth of the inmate population. Proposed procedural changes include increases in the
time limits set for inmate filing of requests and for Bureau responses; additional specifications for the provision
of assistance to inmates; and increased access to Administrative Remedy indexes. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons is proposing to amend its regulations on the Administrative Remedy Program. A final rule on this
subject was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 29, 1979 (44 FR 62250), and was amended December 27, 1979 (44 FR 76726), November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58634), and
on October 29, 1993 (58 FR 58246). 



The proposed revision set forth below is the first major change to the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program since
its adoption on October 29, 1979. Subsequent growth of the inmate population has resulted in an increase in the number
of remedy requests filed. As a means of effectively addressing this situation, the Bureau has reorganized its regulation,
currently entitled Administrative Remedy Procedure for Inmates, for the sake of clarity, and is proposing various
efficiencies in the procedures for processing remedy requests. 

Procedural efficiencies include making adjustments to the time limits for filing requests by inmates and for responses
by the Bureau. The time limit for submission of an initial remedy request by an inmate has been lengthened to 20 calendar
days following the date on which the basis for the request had occurred. Current regulations specify a 15-day limit.
The time limit for submission of an appeal to the General Counsel has been lengthened to 30 calendar days following
the date Regional Counsel signed the response. The proposed time limits for agency responses have also been lengthened,
from 15 to 20 calendar days at the institution level, and from 30 to 40 calendar days at the Central Office level.

Additional revisions include additional guidelines in the following areas: informal resolution, forms, and assistance
to inmates. Also, advances in recordkeeping technology have now made it possible to expand the provisions for access
to remedy indexes. 

The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons, has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing
to the Bureau of Prisons, 320 First Street, NW., HOLC Room 754, Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during the
comment period will be considered before final action is taken. All comments received remain on file for public inspection
at the above address. The proposed rule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearings are contemplated.

Subpart A_[Reserved] 

Subpart B_Administrative Remedy Program 



 542.10 

Purpose and scope. 



The Administrative Remedy Program is a process through which inmates may seek formal review of an issue which relates
to any aspect of their confinement, except as excluded in  542.12, if less formal procedures have not resolved
the matter. This Program applies to all inmates confined in Bureau of Prisons institutions, to inmates designated
to contract Community Corrections Centers (CCCs) under Bureau of Prisons responsibility, and to former inmates
for issues that arose during their confinement, but does not apply to inmates confined in other non-federal facilities.




 542.11 

Responsibility. 



(a) The Community Corrections Manager (CCM), Warden, Regional Director, and General Counsel are responsible for
the implementation and operation of the Administrative Remedy Program at the Community Corrections Center (CCC),
institution, regional and Central Office levels, respectively, and shall: 

(1) Establish procedures for receiving, recording, reviewing, investigating, and responding to Administrative
Remedy Requests (Requests) or Appeals (Appeals) submitted by an inmate;

<PARENT> FR941003-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Acknowledge receipt of a Request or Appeal by returning a receipt to the inmate; 

(3) Conduct an investigation into each Request or Appeal; 

(4) Respond to and sign all Requests or Appeals filed at their levels. At the regional level, signatory authority may
be delegated to the Deputy Regional Director. At the Central Office level, signatory authority may be delegated to
the National Inmate Appeals Administrator. Signatory authority extends to staff designated as acting in the capacities
specified in this  542.11, but may not be further delegated without the written approval of the General Counsel.


(b) Inmates have the responsibility to use this Program in good faith and in an honest and straightforward manner.




 542.12 

Excluded matters. 



(a) An inmate may not use this Program to submit a Request or Appeal on behalf of another inmate. This program is intended
to address concerns that are personal to the inmate making the Request or Appeal, but shall not prevent an inmate from
obtaining assistance in preparing a Request or Appeal, as provided in 
 542.16 of this part. 

(b) Requests or Appeals will not be accepted under the Administrative Remedy Program for claims for which other administrative
procedures have been established, including tort claims, Inmate Accident Compensation claims, and Freedom of Information
or Privacy Act requests. Staff shall inform the inmate in writing of the appropriate administrative procedure if
the Request or Appeal is not acceptable under the Administrative Remedy Program. 



 542.13 

Informal resolution. 



(a) 

Informal Resolution. 

Except as provided in  542.13(b), an inmate shall first present an issue of concern informally to staff, and
staff shall attempt to informally resolve the issue before an inmate submits a Request for Administrative Remedy.


(b) 

Exceptions. 

Inmates in CCCs are not required to attempt informal resolution. An informal resolution attempt is not required prior
to submission to the Regional or Central Office as provided for in  542.14(d) of this part. An informal resolution
attempt may be waived in individual cases at the Warden or institution Administrative Remedy Coordinator's discretion
when the inmate demonstrates an acceptable reason for bypassing informal resolution. 



 542.14 

Initial filing. 



(a) 

Submission. 

After the required informal resolution attempt, an inmate may submit a formal written Administrative Remedy Request
on the appropriate form (BP-9), within 20 calendar days of the date on which the basis for the Request occurred.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Extension. 

Where the inmate demonstrates a valid reason for delay, an extension in filing time may be allowed. In general, valid
reason for delay means a situation which prevented the inmate from submitting the request within the established
time frame. Valid reasons for delay include the following: an extended period in-transit during which the inmate
was separated from documents needed to prepare the Request or Appeal; an extended period of time during which the inmate
was physically incapable of preparing a Request or Appeal; an unusually long period taken for informal resolution
attempts; indication by an inmate, verified by staff, that a response to the inmate's request for copies of dispositions
requested under  542.19 of this part has not been received. 

(c) 

Form

. (1) The inmate shall obtain the appropriate form from CCC staff or institution staff (ordinarily, the correctional
counselor). 

(2) The inmate shall place a single complaint or a reasonable number of closely related issues on the form. If the inmate
includes on a single form multiple unrelated issues, the submission shall be rejected and returned without response,
and the inmate shall be advised to use a separate form for each unrelated issue. For DHO and UDC appeals, each separate
incident report number must be appealed on a separate form. 

(3) The inmate shall complete the form with all requested identifying information and shall state the complaint in
the space provided on the form. If more space is needed, the inmate may use up to one letter-size (8 1/2
'
' by 11
'
') continuation page. The inmate must provide an additional three copies of any continuation page. The inmate
must submit one copy of supporting exhibits. Exhibits will not be returned with the response. Because copies of exhibits
must be filed for any appeal (see  542.15(b)(3)), the inmate is encouraged to retain a copy of all exhibits for
his or her personal records. 

(4) The inmate shall date and sign the Request and submit it to the institution staff member designated to receive such
Requests (ordinarily a correctional counselor). CCC inmates may mail their Requests to the CCM. 

(d) 

Exceptions to initial filing at institution_(1) Sensitive issues

. If the inmate reasonably believes the issue is sensitive and the inmate's safety or well-being would be placed in
danger if the Request became known at the institution, the inmate may submit the Request directly to the appropriate
Regional Director. The inmate shall clearly mark ``Sensitive'' upon the Request and explain, in writing, the reason
for not submitting the Request at the institution. If the Regional Administrative Remedy Coordinator agrees that
the Request is sensitive, the Request shall be accepted. Otherwise, the Request will not be accepted, and the inmate
shall be advised in writing of that determination, without a return of the Request. The inmate may pursue the matter
by submitting an Administrative Remedy Request locally to the Warden. The Warden shall allow a reasonable extension
of time for such a resubmission. 

(2) 

DHO appeals. 

DHO appeals shall be submitted initially to the Regional Director for the region where the inmate is currently located.


(3) 

Control unit appeals. 

Appeals related to Executive Panel Reviews of Control Unit placement shall be submitted directly to the General Counsel.


(4) 

Controlled housing status appeals. 

Appeals related to the Regional Director's review of controlled housing status placement may be filed directly with
the General Counsel. 



 542.15 

Appeals. 



(a) 

Submission. 

An inmate who is not satisfied with the Warden's response may submit an Appeal on the appropriate form (BP-10)
to the appropriate Regional Director within 20 calendar days of the date the Warden signed the response. An inmate
who is not satisfied with the Regional Director's response may submit an Appeal on the appropriate form (BP-11)
to the General Counsel within 30 calendar days of the date the Regional Director signed the response. When the inmate
demonstrates a valid reason for delay, these time limits may be extended. Valid reasons for delay include those situations
described in  542.14(b) of this part. Appeal to the General Counsel is the final administrative appeal.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Form

. (1) Appeals to the Regional Director shall be submitted on the form designed for regional Appeals (BP-10) and
accompanied by one complete copy or duplicate original of the institution Request and response. Appeals to the General
Counsel shall be submitted on the form designed for Central Office Appeals (BP-11) and accompanied by one complete
copy or duplicate original of the institution and regional filings and their responses. Appeals shall state specifically
the reason for appeal. 

(2) An inmate may not raise in an Appeal issues not raised in the lower level filings. An inmate may not combine Appeals
of separate lower level responses (different case numbers) into a single Appeal. 

(3) An inmate shall complete the appropriate form with all requested identifying information and shall state the
reasons for the Appeal in the space provided on the form. If more space is needed, the inmate may use up to one letter-size
(81/2
'
' x 11
'
') continuation page. The inmate shall provide two additional copies of any continuation page and exhibits
with the regional Appeal, and three additional copies with an Appeal to the Central Office (the inmate is also to provide
copies of exhibits used at the prior level(s) of appeal). The inmate shall date and sign the Appeal and mail it to the
appropriate Regional Director, if a Regional Appeal, or to the National Inmate Appeals Section, Office of General
Counsel, if a Central Office Appeal (see 28 CFR part 503 for addresses of the Central Office and Regional Offices).




 542.16 

Assistance. 



(a) An inmate may obtain assistance from another inmate or from institution staff in preparing a Request or an Appeal.
An inmate may also obtain assistance from outside sources, such as family members or attorneys. However, no person
may submit a Request or Appeal on the inmate's behalf, and obtaining assistance will not be considered a valid reason
for exceeding a time limit for submission unless the delay was caused by staff. 

(b) Wardens shall ensure that assistance is available for inmates who are illiterate, disabled, or who are not functionally
literate in English. Such assistance includes provision of reasonable accommodation in order for an inmate with
a disability to prepare and process a Request or an Appeal. 



 542.17 

Resubmission. 



(a) 

Rejections

. The Coordinator at any level (CCM, institution, region, Central Office) may reject and return to the inmate without
response a Request or an Appeal that is written in a manner that is obscene or abusive, or does not meet any other requirement
of this part. 

(b) 

Notice. 

When a submission is rejected, the inmate shall be provided a written notice, signed by the Administrative Remedy
Coordinator, explaining the reason for rejection. If the defect on which the rejection is based is correctable, the
notice shall inform the inmate of a reasonable time extension within which to correct the defect and resubmit the Request
or Appeal. 

(c) 

Appeal of rejections. 

When a Request or Appeal is rejected and the inmate is not given an opportunity to correct the defect and resubmit, the
inmate may appeal the rejection, including a rejection on the basis of an exception as described in  542.14(d),
to the next appeal level. The Coordinator at that level may affirm the rejection, may direct that the submission be
accepted at the lower level (either upon the inmate's resubmission or direct return to that lower level), or may accept
the submission for filing. The inmate shall be informed of the decision by delivery of either a receipt or rejection
notice. 



 542.18 

Response time. 



If accepted, a Request or Appeal is considered filed on the date it is logged into the Administrative Remedy Index as
received. Once filed, response shall be made by the Warden or CCM within 20 calendar days; by the Regional Director
within 30 calendar days; and by the General Counsel within 40 calendar days. If the Request is determined to be of an
emergency nature which threatens the inmate's immediate health or welfare, the Warden shall respond not later than
the third calendar day after filing. If the time period for response to a Request or Appeal is insufficient to make an
appropriate decision, the time for response may be extended once by 20 days at the institution level, 30 days at the
regional level, or 20 days at the Central Office. Staff shall inform the inmate of this extension in writing. Staff
shall respond in writing to all filed Requests or Appeals. If the inmate does not receive a response within the time
allotted for reply, including extension, the inmate may consider the absence of a response to be a denial at that level.




 542.19 

Access to indexes and responses. 



Inmates and members of the public may request access to Administrative Remedy indexes and responses, for which inmate
names and Register Numbers have been removed, as indicated below. Each institution shall make available its index,
and the indexes of its regional office and the Central Office. Each regional office shall make available its index,
the indexes of all institutions in its region, and the index of the Central Office. The Central Office shall make available
its index and the indexes of all institutions and regional offices. Responses may be requested from the location where
they are maintained and must be identified by Remedy ID number as indicated on an index. Copies of indexes or responses
may be inspected during regular office hours at the locations indicated above, or may be purchased in accordance with
the regular fees established for copies furnished under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Patent Appeal and Interference Practice 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce..


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office proposes to amend the rules of practice in patent cases, part 1 of title 37, Code of Federal
Regulations, relating to patent appeal and interference proceedings. The proposed changes include amendments
to conform the interference rules to 35 U.S.C. 104 as amended by Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993) (North
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act) and a number of clarifying and housekeeping amendments.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Amendments Responsive to Adoption of Public Law 103-182


Several of the proposed amendments to the interference rules (i.e., 37 CFR 1.601 

et seq.

) are responsive to Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993) (North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act), which amended 35 U.S.C. 104 to permit reliance on activities occurring in a ``NAFTA country'' to prove a date
of invention. Paragraph (b) of  104 as amended states that ``the term `NAFTA country' has the meaning given that
term in section 2(4) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.'' That section of Public Law 103-182
has been codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301(4), which reads:


(4) NAFTA Country


Except as provided in section 3332 of this title, the term ``NAFTA country'' means_
(A) Canada for such time as the [North American Free Trade] Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States
applies the Agreement to, Canada; and 
(B) Mexico for such time as the Agreement is in force with respect to, and the United States applies the Agreement to,
Mexico.



Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 37 CFR 1.601 by adding a new paragraph (r) defining the term ``NAFTA country''
and ``non-NAFTA country'' and to amend the following interference rules, which set forth the requirements for preliminary
statements, so as to permit reliance on activities occurring in a NAFTA country:   1.622(b), 1.623(a),
1.624(a) and 1.628(b)(2). 


37 CFR 1.684, which relates to the taking of testimony in a foreign country, is proposed to be deleted and reserved in
view of proposed amendments to   1.671 and 1.672. Section 1.671 is proposed to be amended by redesignating
paragraph (h) as paragraph (i) and adding new paragraphs (h) and (j). New paragraph (h) would set forth the requirements
for a motion  1.635 to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign country. New paragraph
(j) would provide that the weight to be given testimony taken in a foreign country will be determined on a case-by-case
basis. Little, if any, weight would be given to testimony taken in a foreign country unless the party taking the testimony
proves by clear and convincing evidence (1) that giving false testimony in an interference proceeding is punishable
as perjury under the laws of the foreign country where the testimony is taken and (2) that the punishment in a foreign
country for giving such false testimony is similar to the punishment for perjury committed in the United States. The
proposed amendments to  1.672 include amending paragraphs (a) and (b), redesignating current paragraphs
(c) through (f) as paragraphs (e) through (h) and adding new provisions identified as paragraphs (c) and (d). Paragraph
(a) as proposed to be amended would limit a party's case-in-chief testimony to affidavits, except where testimony
is to be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24 or compelled from a party or in a foreign country. New paragraph (c) would provide
that where an opponent objects to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted with an affidavit, the
opponent must file and serve objections stating with particularity the nature of the objection, to which the party
may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and supplemental official records and printed publications. New
paragraph (c) further would provide that any objections to the admissibility of any evidence contained in or submitted
with a supplemental affidavit shall be by a motion to suppress under  1.656(h). New paragraph (d) of  1.672
would require any cross-examination of affiants to be by deposition within the United States, which is defined in
current  1.601(p) as the United States of America, its territories and possessions. New paragraph (d) of  1.672
would require that the party whose witness is to be cross-examined notice the deposition under  1.673(e), obtain
a court reporter and provide a translator of the witness will not testify in English. Although not set forth in the proposed
rules, any party attending the deposition can bring its own translator or the parties can agree to share the cost of
single mutually agreeable translator. Paragraphs (g) and (h) of  1.671 as proposed to be amended would provide
that a party seeking to compel testimony or production of documents or things pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 24 or to compel testimony
or production from a party or in a foreign country would have to first file a  1.635 motion to obtain permission
from an administrative patent judge. A motion to compel testimony or the production of documents or things in a foreign
country would have to show that the witness has been asked to testify in the United States and has refused to do so or that
the individual or entity having possession, custody, and control of the document or thing has refused to produce the
document or thing in the United States, even though the moving party has offered to pay the expenses involved in bringing
the witness or the document or thing to the United States. When permission has been obtained from the administrative
patent judge, the party, after also complying with the current requirements for an oral conference ( 1.673(g))
and service of documents and a proffer of access to things ( 1.673(b)), would be required to notice the deposition
under  1.673(a).

<TEXT>
 

Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by adding a paragraph (c) stating that to the extent that any information under
the control of an individual or entity located in a NAFTA country concerning knowledge, use, or other activity relevant
to proving or disproving a date of invention has been ordered to be produced by an administrative patent judge or the
Board ( 1.671(h)), but is not produced for use in the interference to the same extent as such information could
be made available in the United States, the administrative patent judge or the Board shall draw such adverse inferences
as may be appropriate under the circumstances, or take such other action permitted by statute, rule, or regulation,
in favor of the party that requested the information in the interference, including imposition of appropriate sanctions
under  1.616(a). 
Section 1.647, which currently requires a party who relies on a non-English language document to provide an English-language
translation and an affidavit attesting to its accuracy, is proposed to be amended to extend these requirements to
non-English language documents that a party is required to produce via discovery (see  1.671(h)). 


II. Attorney Fees and Expenses 


Section 1.616 is proposed to be amended by redesignating current paragraphs (a) through (e) as paragraphs (a)(1)
through (a)(4) and (a)(6) and adding new paragraphs (a)(5) and (b). New paragraph (a)(5) would authorize the award
of compensatory (as opposed to punitive) expenses and/or attorney fees as a sanction for failing to comply with the
rules or an order, since there are occasions when such a sanction would be more commensurate in scope with the infraction
than the sanctions that are currently authorized. New paragraph (b) would authorize the imposition of a sanction,
including a sanction in the form of compensatory expenses and/or attorney fees, against a party for taking or maintaining
a frivolous position. 
 


III. Certificates of Prior Consultation 


Paragraph (b) of  1.637 currently requires that a miscellaneous motion under  1.635 contain a certificate
stating that the moving party has conferred with all opponents in a good faith effort to resolve by agreement the issues
raised by the motion and indicating whether any other party plans to oppose the motion. It is proposed to amend paragraph
(b) to extend the requirement for such a certificate to motions filed under   1.633 and 1.634 and also to
require the certificate to indicate that the reasons and facts in support of the motion were discussed with each opponent
and, if an opponent has indicated that it will oppose the motion, to identify the issues and/or facts believed to be
in dispute. The proposed requirement for consultation should result in a reduction in the number of issues raised
by motions under  1.633 and 1.634 as well as a reduction in the number of motions filed under those rules. 


IV. Service of a ``Developing Record'' 


In addition to the amendments to  1.672 discussed above under the heading ``Amendments responsive to adoption
of Public Law 103-182,'' it is proposed to amend   1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 to require each party
to serve on each opponent a ``developing record'' that will evolve into the record required to be filed under  1.653.
Specifically, in  1.672, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) to provide that a party presenting testimony
of a witness by affidavit shall, no later than the time set by the administrative patent judge for serving affidavits,
file (which includes serve) the affidavit, whether it is a new affidavit or an affidavit that was previously filed
by that party during 

ex parte

 prosecution of an application or under  1.608 or 1.639(b). 
Sections 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 are proposed to be amended to parallel the proposed amendments to  1.672. Specifically,
paragraph (a) of  1.682 as proposed to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise
admissible, an official record or printed publication not identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral
deposition of a witness, by filing (which includes serving) a copy of the official record or publication no later than
the time set for filing affidavits under  1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement to file
a notice of intent to rely on the official record or printed publication. In  1.683, paragraph (a) as proposed
to be amended would provide that a party may introduce into evidence, if otherwise admissible, testimony by affidavit
or oral deposition from another interference, proceeding, or action involving the same parties by filing (which
includes serving) a copy of the affidavit or a copy of the deposition transcript no later than the time set for filing
affidavits under  1.672(b), thereby dispensing with the current requirement for a party to file a motion under
 1.635 for leave to rely on such testimony. Section 1.688 as proposed to be amended would provide that, if otherwise
admissible, a party may introduce into evidence an answer to a written request for an admission or an answer to a written
interrogatory obtained by discovery under  1.687 by filing a copy of the request for admission or the written
interrogatory and the answer no later than the time set for filing affidavits under  1.672(b). Thus, all evidence
filed under   1.672, 1.682, 1.683 and 1.688 that relates to a party's case-in-chief should be filed together
no later than the date set by an administrative patent judge for the party to serve affidavits under  1.672(b)
for its case-in-chief and all evidence under those sections that relates to the party's rebuttal should be filed no
later than the date set for the party to serve affidavits under  1.672(b) for its case-in-rebuttal.

<TEXT>
 

The pages of all affidavits and deposition transcripts would be required to have sequential numbers that would also
serve as the record page numbers for the affidavits and transcripts in the party's record when it is filed under  1.653.
Likewise, the exhibits identified in the affidavits and deposition transcripts and any official records and printed
publications served under  1.682(a) would be required to have sequential numbers which would serve as the exhibit
numbers when the exhibits are filed with the party's record. Affidavits and  1.683(a) testimony would have
to be accompanied by an index giving the name of each witness and the number of the page where the testimony of each witness
begins. The exhibits would have to be accompanied by an index briefly describing the nature of each exhibit and giving
the number of the page of affidavit or  1.683(a) testimony where each exhibit identified in an affidavit or during
an oral deposition is first identified and offered into evidence.
An opponent who objects to the admissibility of any evidence filed under   1.672(b), 1.682(b), 1.683(a)
and 1.688(a) would have to file objections under   1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) and 1.688(b) no later
than the date set by the administrative patent judge for filing objections to affidavits under paragraph  1.672(c).
An opponent who fails to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on a ground that could have been raised in a timely
objection under   1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) would not be permitted to move under  1.656(h)
to suppress the evidence on that ground. If an opponent timely files an objection to evidence filed under   1.672(b),
1.682(b), 1.683(a) or 1.688(a), the party may respond by filing supplemental affidavits and, in the case of objections
to evidence filed under   1.672(b), 1.682(b) and 1.683(a), may also file supplemental official records
and printed publications. No objection to the admissibility of supplemental evidence shall be made, except as provided
by  1.656(h). The page numbers of the supplemental affidavits would be sequentially numbered beginning with
the number following the last page number of the testimony served under   1.672(b), 1.683(a) and 1.688(a).
Likewise, any additional exhibits identified in the supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records
and printed publications would be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last number of
the previously identified exhibits. After the time expires for filing objections and supplemental affidavits,
or earlier when appropriate, the administrative patent judge would set a time within which any opponent may file a
request to cross-examine an affiant on oral deposition.
If any opponent requests cross-examination of an affiant, the party shall notice a deposition at a reasonable location
within the United States under  1.673(e) for the purpose of cross-examination. Any redirect and recross shall
take place at the deposition. Within 45 days of the close of the period for taking cross-examination ( 1.678
is proposed to be amended to change the time for filing certified transcripts from 45 days to 30 days), the party would
serve (but not file) a copy of each deposition transcript on each opponent together with copies of any additional documentary
exhibits identified by a witness during a deposition. The pages of the transcripts served under this paragraph and
the accompanying exhibits would be sequentially numbered in the manner discussed above. The deposition transcripts
would be accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where cross-examination,
redirect and recross of each witness begins, and an index of exhibits of the type specified in  1.672(b). At this
point in time, the opponent will have been served with all of the testimony that will appear in the party's record (with
the same page numbers) as well as all of the documentary exhibits that will accompany the record (with the same exhibit
numbers).
Since the proposed amendments to  1.672 would require a party, during its testimony period, to file all affidavits
on which it intends to rely at final hearing, it is proposed to delete as unnecessary paragraph (e) of  1.671,
which requires a party to give notice of intent to rely on an affidavit filed by that party during 

ex parte

 prosecution of an application or an affidavit under  1.608 or 1.639(b).

26, 1993), reprinted in 1153 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 59 (Aug. 17, 1993).


VI. Miscellaneous Amendments


Throughout the rules, the term ``examiner-in-chief'' has been replaced by ``administrative patent judge'' to reflect
the change in the title of the members of the Board. See Commissioner's Notice of October 13, 1993, published as ``New
Title for Examiners-in-Chief,'' 1156 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 332 (Nov. 9, 1993).
In  1.11, it is proposed to amend paragraph (e) to allow access to the file on an interference involving a reissue
application once the interference has terminated or an award of priority or judgment has been entered as to all counts.
Although it was intended that the public have access to any interference that involves a case which is open to the public
and  1.11(b) provides that a reissue application is open to the public, interferences involving reissue applications
were inadvertently not included in current  1.11(e).
In  1.192, which specifies the contents of the brief of an appellant for final hearing in an 

ex parte

 appeal, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in three respects. The first proposal is to simplify the language used
to refer to a brief filed by an applicant who is not represented by a registered practitioner. The second is to delete
the requirement that such a brief be in substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (6)
and (7), because experience has shown that it is better to evaluate such briefs on a case-by-case basis. The third is
to codify the ``good cause'' standard that is currently used to determine whether the Board will consider any arguments
or authorities not included in the brief. It is proposed to make clarifying amendments to paragraphs (c), (c)(5) and
(c)(5)(ii), to redesignate current paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(7) as paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(9), and to
add new paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) that would require an appellant who has filed an appeal to the Board to identify
the real party in interest and any related appeals and interferences. The proposed requirement to identify the real
party in interest is derived from Federal Circuit Rule 47.4 and Federal Circuit Form 7. For some time, it has been necessary
to know the identity of the real party in interest. This information would permit members of the Board to comply with
ethics regulations associated with working on matters in which the member has an interest. The proposed requirement
to identify related appeals and interferences is derived in part from Federal Circuit Rule 47.5 and, if adopted, would
prevent the Board from entering inconsistent decisions in related cases.
Section 1.601 is proposed to be amended in several ways. Paragraph (f) as proposed to be amended would specify that
a count should be sufficiently broad as to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties
without being so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art and also to indicate that a phantom count is unpatentable
to all parties under the written description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. Paragraph (g) as
proposed to be amended would broaden the definition of ``effective filing date'' to mean the actual filing date when
the involved application or patent is not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application. Specifically,
paragraph (g) would provide that the effective filing date of an application is the filing date of an earlier application
accorded to the application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121 or 365, or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the
application. The effective filing date of a patent would be defined as the filing date of an earlier application accorded
to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which
matured into the patent. The reference to 35 U.S.C. 121 is included to eliminate any doubt that a divisional application
may be entitled to an earlier filing date in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 121.
Paragraph (j) is proposed to be amended by changing ``which'' to ``that.'' Paragraph (1) is proposed to be amended
by changing ``assignee'' to ``assignee of record in the Patent and Trademark Office.'' Paragraph (q) is proposed
to be amended by deleting ``a panel of'' as superfluous.
Section 1.602 is proposed to be clarified by changing ``within 20 days of'' to ``within 20 days after.''

Sections 1.603 and 1.606 are proposed to be amended by deleting the third sentence (``Each count shall define a separate
patentable invention.'') as redundant in view of the identical sentence in  1.601(f). In addition, it is proposed
to clarify   1.603 and 1.606 by amending them to require each application to contain, or be amended to contain,
at least one patentable claim which corresponds to each count.
In section 1.604, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(1) by changing ``his or her'' to ``its.''
In  1.605, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) for clarification.
Section 1.606 is also proposed to be amended to note that the claim in the application need not be, and most often will
not be, identical to a claim in the patent.
In  1.607, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(4) by changing ``his or her'' to ``its'' and to add a new paragraph
(a)(6) requiring an applicant seeking an interference with a patent to demonstrate compliance with 35 U.S.C. 135(b)
which provides:




A claim which is the same as, or for the same or substantially the same subject matter as, a claim of an issued patent may
not be made in any application unless such a claim is made prior to one year from the date on which the patent was granted.




Requiring an applicant to show compliance with  135(b) before an interference is declared will prevent an interference
from being declared where the applicant cannot satisfy  135(b) with respect to any claim alleged to correspond
to the proposed count.


In  1.608, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (a) and (b) in several respects. First, both paragraphs are proposed
to be amended to delete the information about effective filing dates, which would appear instead in  1.601(g)
as proposed to be amended. Second, it is proposed to relax the current requirement of paragraph (a) for an affidavit
filed by the applicant. Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would permit a statement to be filed by the applicant
or a practitioner of record. Third, it is proposed to change ``sufficient cause'' in paragraph (b) and in other interference
rules to ``good cause'' in order to make it clear that only one ``cause'' standard is intended. Fourth, it is proposed
to change ``81/2 x 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 x 11 inches).''
In  1.609, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) to require the examiner's statement (i.e., the
form PTO-850, also known as the initial interference memorandum) to explain why each claim designated as corresponding
to a count is directed to the same patentable invention as the count and why each claim designated as not corresponding
to a count is not directed to the same patentable invention as the count. The proposed amendment, if adopted, would
provide the Board and the parties with the benefit of the examiner's reasoning and would provide a better foundation
for considering preliminary motions to designate claims as corresponding or as not corresponding to a count.
In  1.610, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by deleting the language ``a panel consisting of at least three
members of'' as superfluous and by deleting the reference to  1.640(e), which is proposed to be amended to allow
a request for reconsideration under  1.640(c) to be decided by an individual administrative patent judge rather
than by the Board. It is further proposed to amend paragraph (b) by deleting ``Unless otherwise provided in this section,''
as unnecessary in light of the proposed amendment to paragraph (a).
Section 1.611 is proposed to be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(8) as paragraph (a)(9) and adding a new paragraph
(a)(8) requiring that a notice of declaration of interference indicate why each claim designated as corresponding
to a count is directed to the same patentable invention as the count and why each claim designated as not corresponding
to a count is not directed to the same patentable invention as the count. This information should assist the parties
in deciding whether to move to have claims designated as corresponding or not corresponding to the count. An administrative
patent judge can satisfy this requirement by enclosing a copy of the examiner's statement with the parties' copies
of the declaration notice. It is also proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3).
In  1.612, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to change ``opposing party's'' to ``opponent's'' and to add
a sentence referring to  1.11(e) concerning public access to interference files.
In  1.614, it is proposed to clarify the meaning of paragraph (a) by changing ``the Board shall assume jurisdiction''
to ``the Board acquires jurisdiction.''
In  1.616, in addition to authorizing an award of compensatory attorney fees and expenses in appropriate circumstances,
as discussed above, it is proposed to amend current paragraph (b) (which is proposed to be redesignated as paragraph
(a)(2)) to permit a party to be sanctioned for failing to comply with the rules or an order by entering an order precluding
the party from filing any type of paper. Paragraph (b) currently permits entry of an order precluding the filing of
a motion or a preliminary statement.
Section 1.617 is proposed to be amended to authorize a party against whom a  1.617(a) order to show cause has been
issued to respond with an appropriate preliminary motion under  1.633(c), (f) or (g). A preliminary motion
under  1.633(c) to redefine the interference, under  1.633(f) for benefit of the filing date of an earlier
application or under  1.633(g) attacking the benefit accorded a patentee may be appropriate where the count
set forth in the notice declaring the interference is not the same as the count proposed in the applicant's showing
under  1.608(b). A preliminary motion under  1.633(f) or (g) may also be appropriate where the count set
forth in the notice delcaring the interference is the same as the count proposed in the applicant's showing under  1.608(b),
but the notice either fails to accord the applicant the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application whose benefit
was requested in the  1608(b) showing or accords the parentee the benefit of the filing date of an earlier application
whose benefit the  1.608(b) showing argued should not be accorded the patentee.
In  1.618, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) for clarification and to state that a paper that has been returned
as unauthorized will not thereafter be considered in the interference. Paragraph (a) currently states that a paper
that has been returned as unauthorized will not thereafter be considered by the Patent and Trademark Office.
In  1.625, it is proposed to simplify paragraph (a) by deleting ``the invention was made in the United States
or abroad and'' as surplusage.
Section 1.626 is proposed to be simplified by changing ``earlier application filed in the United States or aboard''
to ``earlier filed application.'' The same change is proposed for   1.630, 1.633(f), 1.633(g), 1.637(c)(1)(vi),
1.637(e)(1)(viii), 1.637(e)(2)(vii) and 1.637(h)(4).
In  1.628, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``ends of justice'' to ``interest of justice'' to
be consistent with the language used in   1.628(a) and 1.687(c), since a single standard is intended.
Paragraph (a) of  1.628 is also proposed to be amended to apply the ``interest of justice'' requirement only
to corrected preliminary statements that are filed on or after the due date for serving preliminary statements. Where
the moving party has not yet seen the opponent's statement, an opponent will not normally be prejudiced by the filing
of a corrected statement.
In  1.629, it is proposed to amend paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (d) to make them consistent with the proposed amendment
of the definition of ``effective filing date'' in  1.601(g).
In  1.631, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to delete ``by the examiner-in-chief'' (second occurrence)
as superfluous.
Section 1.632 is proposed to be amended to more precisely state that a notice of intent to argue abandonment, suppression
or concealment must be filed ``within ten days after,'' rather than ``within ten days of,'' the close of the testimony-in-chief
of the opponent.

In  1.633, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to specify that a claim shall be construed in light of the specification
of the application or patent in which it appears. This amendment would administratively set aside the judicially
created rule of 

In re Spina, 

975 F.2d 854, 856, 24 USPQ2d 1142, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to the extent it held that the interference rules require that
an ambiguous claim copied from a patent for interference purposes be construed in light of the disclosure of the patent.
A claim that has been added to a pending application for any purpose, including to provoke an interference, would be
given the broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the disclosure of the application to which it is added,
as are claims which are added during 

ex parte 

prosecution. As explained 

In re Zletz, 

893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989).



[D]uring patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as their terms reasonably allow. When
the applicant states the meaning that the claim terms are intended to have, the claims are examined with that meaning,
in order to achieve a complete exploration of the applicant's invention and its relation to the prior art. 

See In re Prater, 

415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969) (before the application is granted, there is no
reason to read into the claim the limitations of the specification). The reason is simply that during patent prosecution
when claims can be amended, ambiguities should be recognized, scope and breadth of language explored, and clarification
imposed. 

Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Quigg, 

822 F.2d 1581, 1583, 3 USPQ2d 1436, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1987); 

In re Yamamoto, 

740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984).



If a party believes an opponent's claim corresponding to the count is ambiguous when construed in light of the opponent's
disclosure, the party should move under  1.633(a) for judgment against the claim on the ground of unpatentability
under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. In paragraph (a), it is also proposed to delete ``by reference to the prior
art of record'' as unnecessary.


Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  1.633 are proposed to be amended by deleting some unnecessary language from
each paragraph and by changing ``derivation'' to ``Derivation'' in paragraph (a)(2). Paragraph (b), which concerns
motions for judgment on the ground of no interference-in-fact, is proposed to be amended by stating that it is possible
for claims of opponents presented in ``means plus function'' format to define separate patentable inventions even
though the claims of the opponents contain the same literal wording. The reason is that the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C.
112, which is applicable to ``means plus function'' limitations in application claims and patent claims, provides
that such limitations are to be construed as covering the corresponding structure disclosed in the associated application
or patent and equivalents thereof. 

In re Donaldson Co., 

16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
Paragraph (i) of  1.633 in its current form authorizes a party who opposes a preliminary motion under  1.633
(a), (b) or (g) to file a preliminary motion under  1.633 (c) or (d). It is proposed to amend paragraph (i) to additionally
authorize a party-patentee to file a preliminary motion under  1.633(h) to add to the interference an application
for reissue of the party's involved patent. Because a reissue application can include an amended or new claim to be
designated as corresponding to a count, the proposed amendment would give a patentee an option similar to that afforded
in the same situation to a party-applicant, who can file a preliminary motion under  1.633(c)(2) to amend a claim
in, or add a claim to, its involved application to be designated as corresponding to a count.
In  1.637, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to incorporate the substance of the Notice of the Chairman of
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of August 10, 1990, published as ``Interferences_Preliminary Motions
for Judgment,'' 1118 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 19 (Sept. 11, 1990). Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would state
that where a party files a preliminary motion for judgment against an opponent under  1.633(a) based on unpatentability
over prior art having a date that appears to make the prior art equally applicable to the moving party, it will be presumed,
without regard to the dates alleged in the preliminary statement of the party, that the cited prior art is also applicable
to the party unless there is included with the motion an explanation, and evidence if appropriate, as to why the prior
art does not apply to the party. The proposed amendment differs from the notice by providing that if the motion fails
to include a sufficient explanation or evidence, the party will not be permitted to rely on any such explanation or
evidence in response to or in any subsequent action in the interference. The notice had directed the administrative
party, a procedure which results in delaying a decision on the preliminary motion. Paragraph (a) is further proposed
to be clarified by changing ``Every'' in the second sentence to ``Each.''
Paragraph (c)(1) of  1.637 sets forth the requirements for a preliminary motion to add or substitute a proposed
count. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1)(v) in two respects. The first is to require a moving party to show that
the proposed count is patentable over the prior art. The second is to specify that a proposed substitute count need
only be shown to be patentably distinct from the other counts proposed to remain in the interference, since a proposed
substitute count need not be patentably distinct from the count it is to replace. Paragraph (c)(1)(vi) is proposed
to be amended to clarify that a preliminary motion under  1.633(c)(1) need not be accompanied by a preliminary
motion for benefit under  1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count.
It is also proposed to add a new paragraph (c)(1)(vii) specifying that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of
the filing date of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party
must show why the opponent is not also entitled to benefit of the filing date of the earlier filed application with respect
to the proposed count. Otherwise, the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to the benefit of the earlier filed application
with respect to the proposed count. The amendment would eliminate the need for an opponent to respond to a  1.633(c)(1)
motion with a preliminary motion under  1.633(f) claiming benefit, which has the effect of delaying a decision
on the  1.633(c)(1) motion.

Paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of  1.637 are proposed to be amended for clarification. Paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)
and  1.637(c)(3)(iii), which relate to  1.633(f) motions for benefit, are proposed to be deleted and
reserved as unnecessary, since motions under  1.633(c) (2) and (3) do not efect the count. Paragraph (c)(3)(ii),
which applies to motions under  1.633(c)(3) to designate a claim as corresponding to a count, is proposed to
be amended to have claims compared to claims, as is the case in  1.633(c)(4)(ii), which applies to motions filed
under  1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to a count. The proposed amendment avoids the need
to compare claims to counts, which are subject to different rules of construction than are claims.



Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of  1.637 is proposed to be amended to require that a party moving to designate a claim as
not corresponding to a count must show that the claim could not serve as the basis for a preliminary motion under  1.633(c)(1)
to add a new count. The proposed amendment, if adopted, would preclude a party from moving to designate one of its claims
as not corresponding to the count where an opponent's disclosure would support a similar claim, in which case the party
could file a  1.633(c)(1) preliminary motion proposing a claim to be added to the opponent's application and
suggesting that the proposed claim and the party's claim in question be designated as corresponding to a proposed
new count.



Paragraph (d)(4) of  1.637, which authorizes a party to file a motion for benefit together with a motion under
 1.633(d), is proposed to be deleted and reserved as unnecessary, because motions filed under  1.633(d)
do not affect the count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(viii) and (e)(2)(vii) are proposed to be amended to make it clear that a
preliminary motion under  1.633(e) (1) or (2) need not be accompanied by a preliminary motion for benefit under
 1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count. Paragraphs (e)(1)(ix)
and (e)(2)(viii) are proposed to be added to specify that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of the filing date
of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party must show why the
opponent is not entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count; otherwise,
the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed
count. Paragraph (f)(2) of  1.637 is proposed to be amended to change ``abroad'' to ``in a foreign country''
and to delete both occurrences of ``filed abroad'' as superfluous.



Paragraph (h) of  1.637 is proposed to be amended to explain that a preliminary motion to add a reissue application
that includes a new or amended claim to be designated as not corresponding to a count will be given the same treatment
as a preliminary motion proposing to amend a claim in, or add a new claim to, an involved application to be designated
as not corresponding to the count, i.e., the preliminary motion will be dismissed. See L'Esperance v. Nishimoto,
18 USPQ2d 1534, 1537 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991) (interference rules do not authorize a motion by party-applicant
to amend or add a claim to be designated as not corresponding to the count).


In  1.638, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) for clarification by changing ``a reply'' to ``any reply.''


in  1.639, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a), which requires that a motion, opposition or reply be accompanied
by the evidence on which a party intends to rely in support of or in opposition to a motion, to be consistent with paragraphs
(c) through (g), which permit some types of evidence to be filed after filing of the motion, opposition or reply. It
is also proposed to amend paragraph (d)(1) by changing ``call'' to ``use.''



In  1.640, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) in several respects. The first is to provide that a decision on
a preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the
opinion that a decision on a preliminary motion will materially advance the resolution of the interference. The second
is to state that a matter raised by a party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to final hearing
will not be entitled to consideration at final hearing unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing.
It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) to state that where the administrative patent judge determines that the
interference shall proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation, a time shall be set for each party
to file a paper identifying any decisions of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed
at final hearing as well as identifying any deferred or belatedly filed motions that the party wishes to have considered
at final hearing. Paragraph (b) as proposed to be amended would also require that any evidence a party wishes to have
considered with respect to the decisions and motions to be considered or reviewed at final hearing, including any
affidavits filed by the party under  1.608(b) or 1.639(b), would have to be served on the opponent during the
testimony-in-chief period of the party.


Paragraph (b)(1) of  1.640 is proposed to be amended for clarification. Paragraph (b)(2), which currently
states that a preliminary motion filed after a decision is entered on preliminary motions under  1.633 will
not be considered except as provided by  1.655(b), is proposed to be amended to state that a preliminary motion
filed after the time expires for filing preliminary motions will not be considered except as provided by  1.645(b)
by changing ``1.655(b)'' to ``1.645(b),'' which relates to consideration of belatedly filed papers in general.



Paragraph (c) of  1.640, which currently requires an administrative patent judge or the Board to specifically
authorize an opposition to a request for reconsideration of a decision by an administrative patent judge, is proposed
to be amended to authorize an opponent to file an opposition, thereby saving the administrative patent judge or the
Board the time it would otherwise take to determine whether an opposition should be authorized. If adopted, the administrative
patent judge would continue to have the authority to deny a request for reconsideration without waiting for an opposition.
In order to conserve the resources of the Board, it is also proposed to delete the last sentence of  1.640(c) so
as to authorize a single individual administrative patent judge to decide a request for reconsideration. Paragraph
(c) is also proposed to be amended to require that a request for reconsideration be filed by hand or Express Mail. Paragraph
(d)(1), which currently states that an order to show cause under that section can be based on a decision on a motion which
is dispositive of the interference against a party as to any count, is proposed to be amended to include decisions on
dispositive matters raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge.




Paragraph (e) of  1.640 is proposed to be amended to incorporate the substance of the Deputy Commissioner's
Notice of December 8, 1986, published as Interference Practice: Response to Order to Show Cause Under 37 CFR 1.640,''
1074 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 4 (Jan. 6, 1987), reprinted in 1086 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 282 (Jan. 5, 1988). Specifically,
paragraph (e) as proposed to be amended would provide that where the order to show cause was issued under  1.640(d)(1),
the party may respond with a paper (i) requesting that final hearing be set to review the decision which is the basis
for the order and identifying every other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have
reviewed by the Board at a final hearing, or (ii) fully explaining why judgment should not be entered. Any other party
would be permitted to file a response to the paper within 20 days of the date of service of the paper. Where the order was
issued under  1.640(d)(1) and the paper includes a request for final hearing, the response must identify every
decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final
hearing. Where the order was issued under  1.640(d)(1) and the paper does not include a request for final hearing,
the response may include a request for final hearing, which must identify every decision of the administrative patent
judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. Where only the response includes
a request for a final hearing, the party who filed the paper would have 14 days from the date of service of the response
in which to file a supplemental paper identifying any other decision of the administrative patent judge that the party
wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. The paper or the response thereto would have to be accompanied
by a motion ( 1.635) requesting a testimony period if a party wishes to introduce any evidence to be considered
at final hearing ( 1.671), such as affidavits previously filed under  1.639(b). A request for a testimony
period would be construed as including a request for final hearing. Where the paper contains an explanation of why
judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order and no party has requested a final hearing, the decision
that is the basis for the order would be reviewed based on the contents of the paper and the response. If the paper fails
to show good cause, the Board would enter judgment against the party against whom the order issued.

Section 1.641 currently indicates that an administrative patent judge who, during the pendency of an interference,
becomes aware of a reason why a claim designated to correspond to a count may not be patentable should notify the parties
of the reason and set a time within which each party may present its views, which the administrative patent judge will
consider in determining how the interference shall proceed. It is proposed to amend  1.641 to indicate that
a party's views may include argument or appropriate preliminary motions under  1.633(c), (d) and (h), including
any supporting evidence. 

In  1.643, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) for clarification and also to change ``ends of justice'' to ``interest
of justice'' to be consistent with the language used in other interference rules, including   1.628(a)
and 1.687(c). 

In  1.644, it is proposed to simplify paragraph (a) by changing ``a panel consisting of more than one examiner-in-chief''
to ``the Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(1), (b) and (c) are proposed to be amended by changing both occurrences of ``panel''
to ``Board.'' Paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) are proposed to be changed to provide that a petition seeking to invoke the
supervisory authority of the Commissioner shall not be filed prior to the party's brief for final hearing; these paragraphs
currently provide that such a petition shall not be filed prior to a decision of the Board awarding judgment. 

 Paragraph (b) of  1.644 is proposed to be clarified by amending it to state that a petition under  1.644(a)
shall be considered timely if it is made as part of, or simultaneously with, a proper motion under  1.633, 1.634,
or 1.635 when granting the motion would require waiver of a rule. In other words, a petition under  1.644(a)(2)
must seek waiver of a rule prospectively rather than retroactively. 

Paragragh (d) of  1.644 is proposed to be amended to provide that the statement of facts in a petition preferably
should be in numbered paragraphs and also to delete the second sentence as unnecessary. Paragraph (f) is proposed
to be amended to change the ``15 days'' in which to request reconsideration of a decision by the Commissioner to ``14
days.'' In paragraph (g), it is proposed to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' 

Section 1.645, which in its current form permits consideration of a belatedly filed paper only if accompanied by a
motion under  1.635 which shows sufficient cause ( 1.645(b)) why the paper was not timely filed, is proposed
to be amended in several respects. First, it is proposed to change ``sufficient cause'' to ``good cause'' in order
to use a single ``cause'' standard throughout the interference rules. Second, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b)
to permit consideration of a belatedly filed paper if an administrative patent judge or the Board, sua sponte, is of
the opinion that it would be in the interest of justice to consider the paper. An example would be where the delay is short
(e.g., one day) and there is no prejudice to an opponent. For purposes of the sections other than  1.645, a belatedly
filed paper is considered ``timely filed'' if accompanied by a motion under  1.635 which is granted. 

Paragraph (d) of  1.645 is proposed to be amended by deleting ``In an appropriate circumstance'' as superfluous
in view of the language ``may stay proceedings,'' which indicates that the administrative patent judge has the discretion
to stay an interference. 

In  1.646, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting the reference to  1.684, which is proposed
to be deleted. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1) by inserting ``or causing a copy of the paper to be handed'' after
``By handing a copy of the paper'' to make it clear that the paper need not be personally delivered by the party, i.e.,
that delivery by hand can be effected by a commercial courier, for example. In paragraph (c)(4), it is proposed to change
``mail'' (second occurrence) to ``first class mail'' to make it clear that the service date specified in that paragraph
applies only to first class mail. It is also proposed to redesignate paragraph (c)(5) as paragraph (c)(6) and to add
a new paragraph (c)(5) which clarifies that a party may serve by Express Mail and that when service is effected by Express
Mail, the date of service is considered to be the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service. Paragraph (d) is proposed
to be amended to delete the quotation marks around ``Express Mail.'' Paragraph (e) is proposed to be amended to state
that the due date for serving a paper is the same as the due date for filing the paper in the Patent and Trademark Office.


In  1.651, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(2) by deleting ``(testimony includes testimony to be taken
abroad under  1.684)'' in order to be consistent with the proposal to delete  1.684. Paragraphs (c)(2)
and (c)(3) are proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed amendment to the definition of ``effective
filing date'' in  1.601(g). In paragraph (d), it is proposed to change ``abroad under  1.684'' to ``in
a foreign country.'' 

In  1.653, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) in several ways. The first is to change the references to paragraphs
of  1.672 to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain paragraphs of  1.672, discussed
below. The second is to delete ``of fact'' in the clause ``agreed statements of fact under  1.672(f)'' (proposed
to be redesignated as  1.672(h)), because agreed statements under  1.672(f) can set forth either (1)
how a particular witness would testify if called or (2) the facts in the case of one or more of the parties. The third is
to delete ``under  1.684(c),'' since  1.684 is proposed to be deleted. A fourth proposed amendment to
 1.653(a) is to indicate that in addition to the types of testimony already set forth in paragraph (a), testimony
includes copies of written interrogatories and answers and written requests for admissions and answers, which might
be obtained where a motion for additional discovery under  1.687(c) is granted.

Paragraph (b) of  1.653 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed redesignation of certain
paragraphs of  1.672, to delete the reference to  1.684(c), which is proposed to be cancelled, and for
clarity. Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of  1.653 are proposed to be amended to make it clear that the only testimony
to be included in a party's record is testimony submitted on behalf of the party. Having copies of the same testimony
appear in both parties' records unnecessarily encumbers the records and is confusing in that a given page of testimony
will have different page numbers in the different records, with the result that the briefs of the parties will refer
to different record pages for the same testimony.

It is proposed that paragraph (c)(5) of  1.653 be deleted and reserved. Paragraph (c)(5) currently requires
that the record filed by each party include each notice, official record and printed publication relied upon by the
party and filed under  1.682(a). This requirement is considered unnecessary because such notices, official
records and printed publications are in the nature of exhibits under  1.653(i), which are submitted with but
not included in the record. The inclusion of exhibits in the record merely increases the size of the record without
serving any useful purpose.

Paragraph (g) of  1.653 is proposed to be amended and paragraphs (f) and (h) deleted and reserved to eliminate
the current distinction between typewritten and printed records. Paragraph (g) is also proposed to be amended to
change ``81/2 x 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to ``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2 x 11 inches)'' and to delete the requirement
for justified margins and to require that the records be bound with covers at their left edges in such manner as to lie
flat when open to any page and in one or more volumes of convenient size (approximately 100 pages per volume is suggested)
and that when there is more than one volume, the numbers of the pages contained in each volume must appear at the top of
the cover for each volume. Paragraph (i) is proposed to be amended to state that exhibits include documents and things
identified in affidavits or on the record during the taking of oral depositions as well as official records and publications
submitted pursuant to  1.682(a).

In  1.654, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``shall'' in the second sentence to ``may'' for clarity
and also to reduce the time for oral argument by a party from 60 minutes to 30 minutes, because most hearings have required
no more than 30 minutes per side and a panel has the discretion to grant more time at the hearing, where necessary.

In  1.655, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing the standard of review from ``erroneous or an abuse
of discretion'' to ``an abuse of discretion.'' The recitation of a separate ``error'' standard is unnecessary, because
an abuse of discretion may be found when (1) the decision of an administrative patent judge is clearly unreasonable,
arbitrary or fanciful, (2) the decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, (3) the findings of the administrative
patent judge are clearly erroneous, or (4) the record contains no evidence upon which the administrative patent judge
rationally could have based the decision. See, 

e.g.

, Heat and Control Inc. v. Hester Industries, Inc., 785 F.2d 1017, 228 USPQ 926 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Western Electric Co.
v. Piezo Technology, Inc. v. Quigg, 860 F.2d 428, 8 USPQ2d 1853 (Fed. Cir. 1988).

It is proposed to amend paragraph (b) of  1.655 to clarify which matters a party is not entitled to raise for consideration
at final hearing. As proposed to be amended, paragraph (b) would provide that a party shall not be entitled to raise
for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been raised by a motion under  1.633 or
1.634 unless (1) the matter was properly raised in a motion that was timely filed by the party under  1.633 or 1.634
and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing, (2) the matter was properly raised by the party in a timely filed
opposition to a motion under  1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition or deferred to final
hearing, or (3) the party shows good cause why the issue was not properly raised by a timely filed motion or opposition.
It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) of  1.655 to state that a change of attorneys during the interference
generally does not constitute good cause for failing to file a timely motion or opposition.

It is further proposed, in response to 

In re Van Geuns,

 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993), to amend paragraph (b) of  1.655 by adding a sentence explaining
that a party who fails to contest, by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under  1.633(c), the designation
of a claim as corresponding to a count may not subsequently argue the separate patentability or the lack of separate
patentability of claims designated as corresponding to the count. The Patent and Trademark Office conducts interference
proceedings to determine who, as between two or more applicants for patent or one or more applicants for patent and
one or more patentees, is the first inventor of a patentable invention. A primary examiner determines in the first
instance whether the claims in a pending application interfere with the claims in another pending application or
unexpired patent. When the examiner is of the view that an interference exists, the Board is notified ( 1.609).
The interference is assigned to an administrative patent judge ( 1.610), who issues a notice declaring the
interference ( 1.611). Each separately patentable invention involved in the interference is defined by a
count, which is merely a vehicle for contesting priority of invention (i.e, who made the invention defined by the count
first) and determining the evidence relevant to the issue of priority. A preliminary determination is made by the
Patent and Trademark Office as to which claims should be designated to correspond to the count. The claims that are
initially determined to define the same patentable invention are designated as corresponding to the count. All other
claims are designated as not corresponding to the count. The designation of claims provides a starting point in an
interference. There is a presumption that the designation of a claim as corresponding or as not corresponding to a
count is correct.

The interference rules authorize a party to file a preliminary motion to redefine an interference by designating
a claim as corresponding ( 1.633(c)(3)) or not corresponding ( 1.633(c)(4)) to a count. Prior to Van
Geuns, the Patent and Trademark Office interpreted the interference rules as requiring a party to file a preliminary
motion under  1.633(c)(4) to designate a claim as not corresponding to the count as a condition for arguing at
final hearing that a claim designated as corresponding to the count is patentably distinct from another claim designated
as corresponding to the count. 

See

 Brooks v. Street, 16 USPQ2d 1374, 1377 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1990); Flehmig v. Geisa, 13 USPQ2d 1052, 1054 (Bd. Pat.
App. & Int. 1989); Kwon v. Perkins, 6 USPQ2d 1747, 1750 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1988), aff'd on other grounds,
886 F.2d 325, 12 USPQ2d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1989); see also Lamont v. Berguer, 7 USPQ2d 1580, 1582 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int.
1988). However, in Van Geuns the Federal Circuit interpreted the rules differently, stating:





[T]he position of the Commissioner that claims designated as corresponding to a court stand or fall with the patentability
of the subject matter of the count is overboard.




988 F.2d at 1185, 26 USPQ2d at 1060. The Court further stated:




[W]e conclude that a party to an interference, who has failed to timely contest the designation of claims as corresponding
to a count, has not conceded that claims corresponding to a count are anticipated or made obvious [i.e., are unpatentable]
by the prior art when the subject matter of account is determined to be unpatentable for obviousness. The PTO must determine,
based on the actual prior art reference or references, whether claims not [designated as] corresponding exactly
to the count are unpatentable.

* * * The interference rules do not specify whether a party may argue the patentability of claims separately
to the EIC [examiner-in-chief, now administrative patent judge] and the board.






Id.

 at 1186, 26 USPQ2d at 1060 (bracketed material added by the Commissioner). The proposed amendment to  655(b)
is designed to overcome the Federal Circuit's interpretation of the rules and to create a presumption that all claims
designated as corresponding to a count are directed to the same patentable invention.



It is proposed to amend paragraph (c) of  1.655 by changing ``To prevent manifest injustice'' to ``In the interest
of justice'' to be consistent with the language used in other interference rules.

In  1.656, it is proposed to redesignate paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) as paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(8),
respectively, and to add new paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) requiring the brief to include (1) a statement of interest
identifying every party represented by the attorney in the interference and the real party in interest if the party
named in the caption is not the real party in interest and (2) a statement or related cases indicating whether the interference
was previously before the Board for final hearing and identifying any related appeal or interference which is pending
before, or which has been decided by, the Board, or which is pending before, or which has been decided by, the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court in a proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 146. A related appeal or interference
is one which will directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the pending
interference. Appeals are mentioned because related issues may be present before the board simultaneously in an
ex parte appeal and an interference. It is also proposed to amend current paragraph (b)(3) (proposed to be redesignated
as paragraph (b)(5)) to specify that statements of fact preferably should be presented in numbered paragraphs.
Current paragraph (b)(4) of  1.656 (proposed to be redesignated as paragraph (b)(6)) requires that the opening
brief of the junior party contain the contentions of the party with respect to the ``issues to be decided,'' which has
been construed to include the matter of whether some of the senior party's evidence of conception was inadmissible
hearsay. Suh v. Hoefle, 23 USPQ2d 1321, 1323 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991). As support, the Board relied on Fisher
v. Bouzard, 3 USPQ2d 1677 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1987), and Moller v. Harding, 214 USPQ 730 (Bd. Pat. Int. 1982). Both
of these cases concern interferences declared under the ``old'' interference rules (i.e.,  1.201 

et seq.

) of which  1.254 specified that the opening brief of the junior party shall ``present a full, fair statement
of the questions involved, including his position with respect to the priority evidence on behalf of other parties.''
Current  1.656(b)(4) does not expressly require, and was not intended to imply, that the opening brief of the
junior party must address the evidence of any other party with respect to the issue of priority or any other issue. In
order to clarify that the opening brief of a junior party need not address the evidence of the other parties, it is proposed
to amend current paragraph (b)(4) to require that the junior party's opening brief contain the contentions of the
party ``with respect to the issues it is raising for consideration at final hearing.'' These issues would include
the junior party's case-in-chief for priority with respect to an opponent or derivation by an opponent as well as matters
raised in any denied or deferred motions of the junior party that are to be reviewed or considered at final hearing.
Where the reply brief of the union party includes a new argument in response the case-in-chief of the senior party as
presented in the senior party's opening brief, the senior party may move under  1.635 for leave to file a reply
to the junior party's reply brief, which motion must be accompanied by a copy of the senior party's reply.

Paragraph (d) of  1.656 is proposed to be amended to state that unless ordered otherwise by an administrative
patent judge, briefs shall be double-spaced (except for footnotes, which may be single-spaced) and shall comply
with the requirements of  1.653(g) for records except the requirement for binding. As a result, the current
distinction between printed and typewritten briefs would be eliminated.
Paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) of  1.656 are proposed to be amended to require an original and 

four

 copies (currently an original and three copies are required) of each brief, any proposed findings of fact and conclusions
of law, any motion under 37 CFR 1.635 to suppress evidence and any opposition to a motion to suppress evidence.
Paragraph (g) of  1.656, which permits a party to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, is further
proposed to be amended to require paragraph numbers for the findings of fact and conclusions of law.
Paragraph (h) is further proposed to be amended to state that a party's failure to challenge the admissibility of the
evidence of an opponent on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under   1.672(c),
1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) constitutes a waiver of the right to move under  1.656(h) to suppress the evidence
on that ground at final hearing.
Paragraph (i) of  1.656 currently provides that if a junior party fails to file an opening brief for final hearing,
an order may be issued by the administrative patent judge requiring the junior party to show cause why the failure to
file a brief should not be treated as a concession of priority and further provides that judgment may be rendered against
the junior party if the junior party ``fails to respond'' within a time period set in the order. The expression ``fails
to respond'' has been misinterpreted by some junior parties as meaning that the mere filing of a response of any kind
to the order to show cause should be sufficient to avoid the entry of judgment. Such an interpretation was not intended
and if adopted would effectively negate  1.656(i). The term ``respond'' is proposed to be changed to ``show
good cause'' in order to make it clear that a junior party's failure to file a timely opening brief will not be excused
unless good cause is shown to explain or justify the failure to file a brief. The language of the rule will then be consistent
with the other interference rules concerning orders to show cause, e.g.,   1.640(c) and 1.652.
Section 1.657 is proposed to be amended to be consistent with the proposed changes to the definition of ``effective
filing date'' in  1.601(g) to state that in an interference involving an application and a patent where the effective
filing date of the application is after the date the patent issued, a junior party has the burden of establishing priority
by clear and convincing evidence, and that in other interferences the junior party has the burden of establishing
priority by a preponderance of the evidence. The proposed amendment would codify the holding of Price v. Symsek, 988
F.2d 1187, 19990-91, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1993), as clarified by Bosies v. Benedict, 27 F.3d 539, 541-42,
30 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
In  1.658, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to state that when the Board enters a decision awarding judgment
as to all counts, the decision shall be regarded as a final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141-144,
146) unless a request for reconsideration under paragraph (b) of this section is timely filed. In paragraph (b), third
sentence, it is proposed to delete the phrases ``[w]here reasonably possible'' and ``such that delivery is accomplished''
as unnecessary and to add a sentence specifying that a decision on reconsideration is a final decision for the purpose
of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141-144, 146). It is also proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing ``reply to
a request for reconsideration'' to be consistent with the terminology employed in  1.640(c) regarding requests
for reconsideration of decisions on preliminary motions.

Section 1.660 is proposed to be amended by adding a new paragraph (e) explaining that the failure of a party to comply
with the notice provisions of  1.660 may result in sanctions under  1.616, that knowledge by, or notice
to, an employee of the Office other than an employee of the Board, of the existence of the reexamination, application
for reissue, protest, or litigation shall not be sufficient, and that the notice contemplated by this section is notice
addressed specifically to an administrative patent judge or the Board.

In  1.662, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``filing by an applicant or patentee'' in the second
sentence to ``filing by a party'' to make it clear that the terminal disclaimer can be signed by the party's attorney
or agent of record. For the same reason, it is proposed to change ``by an applicant'' to ``by a party'' in the third sentence
of paragraph (a), which concerns abandonment of an involved application.

In paragraph (b) of  1.662, the first sentence is proposed to be amended to change ``omits all claims of the patent
corresponding to the counts of the interference for the purpose of avoiding the interference'' to ``does not include
a claim that corresponds to a count'' in order to make it clear that judgment may not be entered where the reissue application
includes a new or amended claim that should be designated as corresponding to a count, even if the patentee argues that
it should be designated as not corresponding to a count. Similarly, it is proposed to change ``reissue other than for
the purpose of avoiding the interference'' to ``reissue which includes a claim that corresponds to a count.''

In  1.671, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``

evidence

 from another interference, proceeding, or action filed  1.683'' to ``

testimony

 from another interference, proceeding, or action filed under  1.683'' in order to be consistent with the terminology
of  1.683. It is proposed to amend paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of  1.671 to change ``by oral deposition
or affidavit'' to ``by affidavit or oral deposition.'' Paragraph (f) is proposed to be amended to clarify that the
requirement for the significance of documentary and other exhibits to be discussed with particularity by a witness
applies only to documentary and other exhibits identified by a witness in an affidavit or during oral deposition.
Paragraph (f) does not apply to official records and printed publications submitted into evidence pursuant to  1.682(a).

In  1.672, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above under the heading ``Amendments responsive
to adoption of Public Law 103-182,'' it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) by deleting the third sentence, which
specifies the type of paper to be used for affidavits, as being superfluous in view of  1.677(a). In paragraph
(d), it is proposed to delete the fifth sentence (``A party electing to present testimony of a witness by deposition
shall notice a deposition of the witness under  1.673(a).'') as superfluous in view of the second sentence of
 1.672(d).

In  1.673, it is proposed to amend paragraph (b) by changing the time for service of evidence to be relied on at
an oral deposition from ``at least three days'' prior to the conference required by  1.673(g) when service is
by hand or by Express Mail to ``at least three working days'' prior to the conference. It is also proposed to amend paragraph
(b) to change the time for service by any other means from 10 days to 14 days prior to the conference.

It is proposed to amend paragraph (d) of  1.673 by deleting the second sentence as unnecessary, since all depositions
for a case-in-chief would have to be approved by an administrative patent judge. It is also proposed to delete the quotation
marks around ``Express Mail'' in paragraph (b).

Also in  1.673, it is proposed to clarify paragraph (e) by changing ``party electing to present testimony by
affidavit'' to ``party who has presented testimony by affidavit.''

In paragraph (a) of  1.674, which specifies before whom depositions may be taken, it is proposed to delete the
reference to ``United States or a territory or insular possession of the United States'' in order to make this paragraph
applicable to depositions for testimony compelled in foreign countries.

In  1.675, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d), which concerns reading and signing of a transcript by the witness,
to take into account that the witness might refuse to read and/or sign the transcript of the deposition, in which case
the circumstances under which the witness refused to sign must be noted on the certificate by the officer who prepared
the certified transcript ( 1.676(c)).

In  1.676, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a)(4) by changing ``opposing party'' to ``opponent.''

Section 1.677, which in its current form specifies the required form for transcripts of depositions, is proposed
to be amended to also apply to affidavits. Furthermore, it is proposed to delete the reference to ``typewritten''
matter, to change ``pica-type'' to ``11 point type'' and to change ``81/2  x  11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.)'' to
``21.8 by 27.9 cm. (81/2  x  11 inches).''

In  1.678, it is proposed to change the section heading from ``Transcript of deposition must be filed'' to ``Time
for filing transcript of deposition'' for clarity and to amend the text by changing the time for filing the certified
transcript from 45 days to 30 days.

In  1.679, it is proposed to change ``transcript'' to ``transcript of a deposition'' for clarity and also to
delete ``for printing ( 1.653(g))'' as unnecessary.

In  1.682, in addition to the proposed amendments discussed above under the heading ``service of a `developing
record,''' it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) by changing ``identified during the taking of testimony of a witness''
to ``identified in an affidavit or on the record during an oral deposition of a witness'' for clarity. It is also proposed
to delete and reserve paragraph (a)(4) (``where appropriate, be accompanied by a certified copy of the official record
or a copy of the printed publication ( 1.671(d))'') as superfluous in view of Rules 901 and 902 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, which apply to interference proceedings ( 1.671(b)) and require authentication of evidence
that is not self-authenticating. Finally, it is proposed to capitalize the first word in each of paragraphs (a)(2),
(a)(3) and (a)(4).

In  1.685, it is proposed to amend paragraph (d) for clarification.

In  1.687, it is proposed to amend paragraph (c) to refer to  1.647 concerning translations of documents
in a foreign language.



Other Considerations



These proposed rules conform with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq., 

Executive Order 12866, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these proposed rules are not significant for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866.

The Assistant Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the changes
clarify existing rules setting forth the procedures used in patent appeals and interferences.

The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship
between the National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.

These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501


et.seq., 

since no record keeping or reporting requirements within the coverage of the Act are placed upon the public.

Scope of rules, definitions.



* * * * *



(f) A 

count

 defines the interfering subject matter between (1) two or more applications or (2) one or more applications and one
or more patents. 

>

A count should be broad enough to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties. A count
may not be so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art.

<

 When there is more than one count, each count shall define a separate patentable invention. Any claim of an application
or patent 
which
 

>

that is designated to

<

 correspond
s
 to a count is a claim involved in the interference within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 135(a). A claim of a patent or application


>

designated to correspond to a count that

<

 
which
 is identical to a count is said to ``correspond exactly'' to the count. A claim of a patent or application 

>

designated to correspond to a count that

<

 
which
 is not identical to a count 
, but which defines the same patentable invention as the count,
 is said to ``correspond substantially'' to the count. When a count is broader in scope than all claims which correspond
to the count, the count is a ``phantom count.'' A phantom count is 
not patentable to any party
 

>

unpatentable to all parties under the written description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112

<

.

(g) The 

effective filing date

 of an application 
or a patent
 is the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the application 
or patent
 under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 

>

121,

<

 or 365 

>

or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application. The 

effective filing date

 of a patent is the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) or,
if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which issued as the patent.

(k) A 

lead

 attorney or agent is a registered attorney or agent of record who is primarily responsible for prosecuting an interference
on behalf of a party and is the attorney or agent whom an

of
 the change.



6. Section 1.603 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:



 1.603

Interference between applications; subject matter of the interference.



Before an interference is declared between two or more applications, the examiner must be of the opinion that there
is interfering subject matter claimed in the applications which is patentable to each applicant subject to a judgment
in the interference. The interfering subject matter shall be defined by one or more counts. 
Each count shall define a separate patentable invention.
 Each application must contain, or be amended to contain, at least one

drawn to an invention claimed in another application or patent

<

 for the purpose of an interference with another application or a patent. The applicant to whom the claim is suggested
shall amend the application by presenting the suggested claim within a time specified by the examiner, not less than
one month. Failure or refusal of an applicant to timely present the suggested claim shall be taken without further
action as a disclaimer by the applicant of the invention defined by the suggested claim. At the time the suggested claim
is presented, the applicant may also (1) call the examiner's attention to other claims already in the application
or which are presented with the suggested claim and (2) explain why the other claims 
would be more appropriate to
 

>

should

<

 be included in any interference which may be declared.


* * * * *



9. Section 1.606 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:



 1.606 

Interference between an application and a patent; subject matter of the interference.



Before an interference is declared between an application and an unexpired patent, an examiner must determine that
there is interfering subject matter claimed in the application and the patent which is patentable to the applicant
subject to a judgment in the interference. The interfering subject matter will be defined by one or more counts. 
Each count shall define a separate patentable invention.
 

>

The

<

 
Any
 application must contain, or be amended to contain, at least one

patentable

<

 claim which corresponds to each count. 

>

The claim in the application need not be, and most often will not be, identical to a claim in the patent.

<

 All claims in the application and patent which define the same patentable invention as a count shall be designated
to correspond to the count. At the time an interference is initially declared ( 1.611), a count shall not be narrower
in scope than any patent claim which corresponds to the count and any single patent claim will be presumed. subject
to a motion under  1.633(c), not to contain separate patentable inventions.

Interference between an application and a patent; prima facie showing by applicant.



(a) When the 
earlier of the filing date or
 effective filing date of an application is three months or less after the 
earlier of the filing date or
 effective filing date of a patent, 
the applicant,
 before an interference will be declared, 

>

either the applicant or the applicant's attorney or agent of record

<

 shall file 
an affidavit
 

>

a statement

<

 alleging that there is a basis upon which 

>

the

<

 applicant is entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee.

(b) When the 
earlier of the filing date or the
 effective filing date of an application is more than three months after the 
earlier of the filing date or the
 effective filing date 
under 35 U.S.C. 120
 of a patent, the applicant, before an interference will be declared, shall file (1) evidence which may consist of patents
or printed publications, other documents, and one or more affidavits which demonstrate that applicant is 

prima facie 

entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee and (2) an explanation stating with particularity the basis upon which
the applicant is 

prima facie 

entitled to the judgment. Where the basis upon which an applicant is entitled to judgment relative to a patentee is
priority of invention, the evidence shall include affidavits by the applicant, if possible, and one or more corroborating
witnesses, supported by documentary evidence, if available, each setting out a factual description of acts and circumstances
performed or observed by the affiant, which collectively would 

prima facie 

entitle the applicant to judgment on priority with respect to the 
earlier of the filing date or
 effective filing date of the patent. To facilitate preparation of a record ( 1.653 (g) and (h)) for final hearing,

sufficient
 cause, an affidavit may be based on information and belief. If an examiner finds an application to be in condition for
declaration of an interference, the examiner will consider the evidence and explanation only to the extent of determining
whether a basis upon which the application would be entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee is alleged and,
if a basis is alleged, an interference may be declared.

 1.617

Summary judgment against applicant.



(a) An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 shall review any evidence filed by an applicant under  1.608(b) to determine if the applicant is 

prima facie

 entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee. If the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 determines that the evidence shows the applicant is 

prima facie

 entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the interference shall proceed in the normal manner under the regulations
of this part. If in the opinion of the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 the evidence fails to show that the applicant is 

prima facie 

entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 shall, concurrently with the notice declaring the interference, enter an order stating the reasons for the opinion
and directing the applicant, within a time set in the order, to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered
against the applicant.

(b) The applicant may file a response to the order 

>

, which may include an appropriate preliminary motion under  1.633(c), (f) or (g),

<

 and state any reasons why summary judgment should not be entered. Any request by the applicant for a hearing before
the Board shall be made in the response. Additional evidence shall not be presented by the applicant or considered
by the Board unless the applicant shows good cause why any additional evidence was not initially presented with the
evidence filed under  1.608(b). At the time an applicant files a response, the applicant shall serve a copy of
any evidence filed under  1.608(b) and this paragraph.



* * * * *



(d) If a response is timely filed by the applicant, all opponents may file a statement 

>

and may oppose any preliminary motion filed under  1.633(c), (f) or (g) by the applicant

<

 within a time set by the 

>

adminsitrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
. The statement may set forth views as to why summary judgment should be granted against the applicant, but the statement
shall be limited to discussing why all the evidence presented by the applicant does not overcome the reasons given
by the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 for issuing the order to show cause. 

>

Except as required to oppose a motion under  1.633(c), (f) or (g) by the applicant, evidence

<

 
Evidence
 shall not be filed by any opponent. An opponent may not request a hearing.

(e) Within a time authorized by the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
, an applicant may file a reply to any statement 

>

or opposition

<

 filed by any opponent.



* * * * *



(g) If a response by the applicant is timely filed, the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 or the Board shall decide whether the evidence submitted under  1.608(b) and any additional evidence properly
submitted under 

>

paragraphs

<

 
paragraph
 (b) 

>

and (e)

<

 of this section shows that the applicant is 

prima facie

 entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee. If the applicant is not 

prima facie

 entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the Board shall enter a final decision granting summary judgment
against the applicant. Otherwise, an interlocutory order shall be entered authorizing the interference to proceed
in the normal manner under the regulations of this subpart.

(h) Only an applicant who filed evidence under  1.608(b) may requests a hearing. If that applicant requests
a hearing, the Board may hold a hearing prior to entry of a decision under paragraph (g) of this section. The 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 shall set a date and time for the hearing. Unless otherwise ordered by the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 or the Board, the applicant and any opponent will each be entitled to no more than 30 minutes of oral argument at the hearing.

39. Section 1.640 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (b)(1), (b)(2), (c), (d), (d)(1), (d)(3)
and (e) to read as follows:



 1.640

Motions, hearing and decision, redeclaration of interference, order to show cause.



(a) A hearing on a motion may be held in the discretion of the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
. The 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 shall set the date and time for any hearing. The length of oral argument at a hearing on a motion is a matter within the
discretion of the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
. An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may direct that a hearing take place by telephone.

(b) 

>

Unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the opinion that a decision on a preliminary motion would materially
advance the resolution of the interference, decision on a preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing.

<

 Motions 

>

otherwise

<

 will be decided by an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
. An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may consult with an examiner in deciding motions involving a question of patentability. An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 

>

may take up motions for decision in any order and

<

 may grant or deny any motion or take such other action which will secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination
of the interference. 

>

A matter raised by a party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to final hearing will not be entitled
to consideration at final hearing unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing. If the administrative
patent judge determines that the interference shall proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation,
a time shall be set for each party to file a paper identifying any decisions on motions or on matters raised sua sponte
by the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed at final hearing as well as identifying any
deferred motions that the party wishes to have considered at final hearing. Any evidence that a party wishes to have
considered with respect to the decisions and motions identified by the party or by an opponent for consideration or
review at final hearing, including any affidavit filed by the party under  1.608 or 1.639(b), shall be served
on the opponent during the testimony-in-chief period of the party.

<



(1) 

>

When appropriate after the time expires for filing replies to oppositions to preliminary motions

<

 
When preliminary motions under  1.633 are decided
, the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 will 
, when necessary,
 set a time for filing any amendment to an application involved in the interference and for filing a supplemental preliminary
statement as to any new counts 

>

which may become

<

 involved in the interference 

>

if a preliminary motion to amend or substitute a count has been filed

<

. Failure or refusal of a party to timely present an amendment required by an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 shall be taken without further action as a disclaimer by that party of the invention involved. A supplemental preliminary
statement shall meet the requirements specified in  1.623,  1.624,  1.625, or  1.626, but
need not be filed if a party states that it intends to rely on a preliminary statement previously filed under  1.621(a).


>

At an appropriate time in the interference, and when necessary

<

 
After the time expires for filing any amendment and supplemental preliminary statement
, 

>

an order will be entered redeclaring 
the examiner-in-chief will, if necessary, redeclare
 the interference.

(2) After 

>

the time expires for filing preliminary motions

<

 
a decision is entered on preliminary motions filed under  1.633
, a further 

>

preliminary

<

 motion under  1.633 will not be considered except as provided by  
1.655(b)
 

>

1.645(b)

<

.

(c) When a decision on any motion under  1.633,  1.634, or  1.635 

>

or on any matter raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge

<

 is entered which does not result in the issuance of an order to show cause under paragraph (d) of this section, a party
may file a request for reconsideration within 14 days after the date of the decision. 

>

The request for reconsideration shall be served by hand or Express Mail.

<

 The filing of a request for reconsideration will not stay any time period set by the decision. The request for reconsideration
shall specify with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the
decision. 

>

An opponent may file an opposition within 14 days after service of the request for reconsideration.

<

 
No opposition to a request for reconsideration shall be filed unless requested by an examiner-in-chief or the Board.
A decision of a single examiner-in-chief will not ordinarily be modified unless an opposition has been requested
by an examiner-in-chief or the Board. The request for reconsideration shall be acted on by a panel of the Board consisting
of at least three examiners-in-chief, one of whom will normally be the examiner-in-chief who decided the motion
.

(d) An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may issue an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered against a party when:

(1) A decision on a motion 

>

or on a matter raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge

<

 is entered which is dispositive of the interference against the party as to any count;



* * * * *



(3) The party is a junior party whose preliminary statement fails to overcome the 
earlier of the filing date or
 effective filing date of another party.

(e) When an order to show cause is issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the Board shall enter judgment in accordance
with the order unless, within 20 days after the date of the order, the party against whom the order issued files a paper
which shows good cause why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order.

>

(1) If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the paper may (i) request that final hearing be set
to review any decision which is the basis for the order as well as any other decision of the administrative patent judge
that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at final hearing, or (ii) fully explain why judgment should not be
entered. 

(2)

<

 Any other party may file a response to the paper within 20 days of the date of service of the paper. 

>

If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(10 of this section and the paper includes a request for final hearing, the
response must identify every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have
reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the paper
does not include a request for final hearing, the response may include a request for final hearing, which must identify
every decision of the administrative patent judge that the responding party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at
a final hearing. Where only the response includes a request for a final hearing, the party that filed the paper has 14
days from the date of service of the response in which to file a supplemental paper identifying any other decision of
the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. 

(3) The paper or the response thereto should be accompanied by a motion ( 1.635) requesting a testimony period
if a party wishes to introduce any evidence to be considered at final hearing ( 1.671). A request for a testimony
period shall be construed as including a request for final hearing. 

(4) If the paper contains an explanation of why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order and no party
has requested a final hearing, the decision that is the basis for the order shall be reviewed based on the contents of
the paper and the response. If the paper fails to show good cause, the Board shall enter judgment against the party against
whom the order issued.

<

 
If the party against whom the order was issued fails to show good cause, the Board shall enter judgment against the party.
If a party wishes to take testimony in response to an order to show cause, the party's response should be accompanied
by a motion ( 1.635) requesting the testimony period. See  1.651(c)(4).
 


40. Section 1.461 and the section heading are proposed to be revised to read as follows: 



 1.641

Addition of application or patent to interference.



During the pendency of an interference, if the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 becomes aware of an application of a patent not involved in the interference which claims the same patentable invention
as a count in the interference, the

examiner-in-chief
 may add the application or patent to the interference on such terms as may be fair to all parties.

42. Section 1.643 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows:

to permit

<

 
require that
 the assignee of a part interest

>

the party's brief for final hearing (see  1.656)

<

 
the decision by the Board awarding judgment

44. Section 1.645 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) to read as follows:



 1.645

Extension of time, late papers, stay of proceedings.



(a) Except to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for
commencing a civil action, a party may file a motion ( 1.635) seeking an extension of time to take action in an
interference. See  1.304(a) for extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil action. The motion shall be filed within sufficient time to actually
reach the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 before expiration of the time for taking action. A moving party should not assume that the motion will be granted even
if there is no objection by any other party. The motion will be denied unless the moving party shows good cause why an
extension should be granted. The press of other business arising after an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 sets a time for taking action will not normally constitute good cause. A motion seeking additional time to take testimony
because a party has not been able to procure the testimony of a witness shall set forth the name of the witness, any steps
taken to procure the testimony of the witness, the dates on which the steps were taken, and the facts expected to be proved
through the witness.

(b) Any paper belatedly filed 
,
 will not be considered except upon motion ( 1.635) which shows 

>

good

<

 
sufficient
 cause why the paper was not timely filed 
.
 

>

or an administrative patent judge or the Board, sua sponte, is of the opinion that it would be in the interest of justice
to consider the paper.

<

 See  1.304(a) for exclusive procedures relating to belated filing of a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit or belated commencement of a civil action.



* * * * *



(d) 
In an appropriate circumstance, an
 

>

An administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may stay proceedings in an interference.

(e), redesignating paragraph (c)(5) as (c)(6) and revising it, and adding a new paragraph (c)(5) to read as follows:



 1.646

Service of papers, proof of service. 



(a) * * *

(1) Preliminary statements when filed under  1.621; preliminary statements shall be served when service is

 1.676 
or 1.684
; copies of transcripts shall be served as part of a party's record under  1.653(c).

(b) Service shall be on an attorney or agent for a party. If there is no attorney or agent for the party, service shall
be on the party. An

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may order additional service or waive service where appropriate.

(c) Unless otherwise ordered by an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
, or except as otherwise provided by this subpart, service of a paper shall be made as follows:

>

or causing a copy of the paper to be handed

<

 to the person served.

first class

<

 mail the date of mailing is regarded as the date of service.

(5) 

>

By mailing a copy of the paper by Express Mail; when service is by Express Mail the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal
Service is regarded as the date of service.

(6) 

<

 When it is shown to the satisfaction of an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 that none of the above methods of obtaining or serving the copy of the paper was successful, the 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may order service by publication of an appropriate notice in the 

Official Gazette.



(d) An 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 may order that a paper be served by hand or 
``
Express Mail
''
.

(e) 

>

The due date for serving a paper is the same as the due date for filing the paper in the Patent and Trademark Office.

<

 Proof of service must be made before a paper will be considered in an interference. Proof of service may appear on or
be affixed to the paper. Proof of service shall include the date and manner of service. In the case of personal service
under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, proof of service shall include the names of any person served
and the person who made the service. Proof of service may be made by an acknowledgment of service by or on behalf of the
person served or a statement signed by the party or the party's attorney or agent containing the information required
by this section. A statement of an attorney or agent attached to, or appearing in, the paper stating the date and manner
of service will be accepted as 

prima facie

 proof of service.

why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order. Any other party may file a response to the paper within
15 days of the date of service of the paper. If the party against whom the order was issued fails to show good cause, the
Board shall enter judgment against the party.

49. Section 1.653 is proposed to be amended by deleting paragraphs (c)(5), (f) and (h) and redesignating them as ``Reserved''

When the record is type written, it must be clearly legible on opaque, unglazed, durable paper approximately 81/2
by 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm.) in size (letter size). Typing shall be double-spaced on one side of the paper in not smaller

be filed with the record. Each exhibit shall contain a label which identifies the party submitting the exhibit and
an exhibit number, the style of the interference (e.g., Jones v. Smith), and the interference number. Where possible,
the label should appear at the bottom right-hand corner of each documentary exhibit. Upon termination of an interference,

50. Section 1.654 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (d) to read as follows:



 1.654



Final hearing.



(a) At an appropriate stage of the interference, the parties will be given an opportunity to appear before the Board
to present oral argument at a final hearing. An

51. Section 1.655 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to read as follows:


 1.655 

Matters considered in rendering a final decision.


(a) In rendering a final decision, the Board may consider any properly raised issue including (1) priority of invention,
(2) derivation by an opponent from a party who filed a preliminary statement under  1.625, (3) patentability
of the invention, (4) admissibility of evidence, (5) any interlocutory matter deferred to final hearing, and (6)
any other matter necessary to resolve the interference. The Board may also consider whether 

>

entry of

<

 any interlocutory order was 
erroneous or
 an abuse of discretion. All interlocutory orders shall be presumed to have been correct and the burden of showing 
error or
 an abuse of discretion shall be on the party attacking the order. When two or more interlocutory orders involve the
same issue, the last entered order shall be presumed to have been correct.
(b) A party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at final hearing a matter which properly could have been
raised by a motion under   1.633 or 1.634 unless (1) the 

>

matter was properly raised in a

<

 motion 

>

that

<

 was 
properly
 

>

timely

<

 filed 

>

by the party under   1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing

<

, (2) the matter was properly raised by 
a
 

>

the

<

 party in 
an
 

>

a timely filed

<

 opposition to a motion under   1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition 

>

or deferred to final hearing

<

, or (3) the party shows good cause why the issue was not 
timely
 

>

properly

<

 raised by 

>

a timely filed

<

 motion or opposition. 

>

A change of attorneys during the interference generally does not constitute good cause. A party who fails to contest,
by way of a timely filed preliminary motion under  1.633(c), the designation of a claim as corresponding to a
count may not subsequently argue to an administrative patent judge or the Board the separate patentability or lack
of separate patentability of claims designated to correspond to the count.

<


(c) 

>

In the interest of justice

<

 
To prevent manifest injustice
, the Board may 

>

exercise its discretion to

<

 consider an issue even though it would not otherwise be entitled to consideration under this section.
52. Section 1.656 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (d), (e), (g), (h) and (i), redesignating paragraphs
(b)(1) through (b)(6) as (b)(3) through (b)(8), revising newly designated paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), and adding
new paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) to read as follows:


 1.656 

Briefs for final hearing.


(a) Each party shall be entitled to file briefs for final hearing. The

A statement of interest indicating:
(i) The full name of every party represented by the attorney in the interference.
(ii) The name of the real party in interest if the party named in the caption is not the real party in interest.
(2) A statement of related cases indicating:
(i) Whether the interference was previously before the Board for final hearing.
(ii) The name and number of any related appeal or interference which is pending before, or which has been decided by,
the Board, or which is pending before, or which has been decided by, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
or a district court in a proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 146. A related appeal or interference is one which will directly
affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the pending interference.

Unless ordered otherwise by an administrative patent judge, briefs shall be double-spaced (except for footnotes,
which may be single-spaced) and shall comply with the requirements of  1.653(g) for records except the requirement
for binding.

<

 
Briefs may be printed or typwritten. If typewritten, legal-size paper may be used. The opening brief of each party
in excess of 50 legal-size double-spaced typewritten pages or any other brief in excess of 25 legal-size double spaced
typewritten pages shall be printed unless a satisfactory reason be given why the brief should not be printed. Any printed
brief shall comply with the requirements of  1.653(g). Any typewritten brief shall comply with the requirements
of  1.653(h), except legal-size paper may be used and the binding and covers specified are not required.


(e) An original and

, separate from its opening or reply brief, but filed concurrently therewith, may file a paper accepting or objecting
to any proposed findings of fact or conclusions of law; when objecting, a reason must be given. The Board may adopt the
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in whole or in part.

(h) If a party wants the Board in rendering its final decision to rule on the admissibility of any evidence, the party
shall file with its opening brief an original and 

>

four

<

 
three
 copies of a motion ( 1.635) to suppress the evidence. The provisions of  1.637(b) do not apply to a motion
to suppress under this paragraph. Any objection previously made to the admissibility of

the evidence of an opponent

<

 
an opponent's evidence
 is waived unless the motion required by this paragraph is filed. 

>

A party that failed to challenge the admissibility of the evidence of an opponent on a ground that could have been raised
in a timely objection under  1.672(c), 1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) may not move under this paragraph to suppress
the evidence on that ground at final hearing.

<

 An original and

four

<

 
three
 copies of an opposition to the motion may be filed with an opponent's opening brief or reply brief as may be appropriate.

(i) When a junior party fails to timely file an opening brief, an order may issue requiring the junior party to show cause
why the Board should not treat failure to file the brief as a concession of priority. If the junior party fails to 

>

show good cause

<

 
respond
 within a time period set in the order, judgment may be entered against the junior party.

53. Section 1.657 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:



 1.657


Burden of proof as to date of invention.





>

(a)

<

 A rebuttable presumption shall exist that, as to each count, the inventors made their invention in the chronological
order of the earlier of their 
filing dates or
 effective filing dates. The burden of proof shall be upon a party who contends otherwise.



>

(b) In an interference involving copending applications or involving a patent and an application having an effective
filing date on or before the date the patent issued, a junior party shall have the burden of establishing priority by
a preponderance of the evidence.

(c) In an interference involving an application and a patent and where the effective filing date of the application
is after the date the patent issued, a junior party shall have the burden of establishing priority by clear and convincing
evidence.

<



54. Section 1.658 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows:



 1.658


Final decision.



(a) After final hearing, the Board shall enter a decision resolving the issues raised at final hearing. The decision
may (1) enter judgment, in whole or in part, (2) remand the interference to an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
 for further proceedings, or (3) take further action not inconsistent with law. A judgment as to a count shall state
whether or not each party is entitled to a patent containing the claims in the party's patent or application which correspond
to the count. When the Board enters a decision awarding judgment as to all counts, the decision shall be regarded as
a final decision 

>

for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141-144, 146) unless a request for reconsideration under paragraph
(b) of this section is timely filed

<

.

(b) Any request for reconsideration of a decision under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed within one month
after the date of the decision. The request for reconsideration shall specify with particularity the points believed
to have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision. Any 
reply

 to a request for reconsideration shall be filed within 14 days of the date of service of the request for reconsideration.

Where reasonably possible, service

 The Board shall enter a decision on the request for reconsideration. If the Board shall be of the opinion that the decision
on the request for reconsideration significantly modifies its original decision under paragraph (a) of this section,
the Board may designate the decision on the request for reconsideration as a new decision.

55. Section 1.660 is proposed to be amended by adding paragraph (e) to read as follows:



 1.660



Notice of reexamination, reissue, protest or litigation.



* * * * *





>

(e) The notice required by this section is designed to assist the administrative patent judge and the Board in efficiently
handling interference cases. Failure of a party to comply with the provisions of this section may result in sanctions
under  1.616. Knowledge by, or notice to, an employee of the Office other than an employee of the Board, of the
existence of the re-examination, application for reissue, protest, or litigation shall not be sufficient. The notice
contemplated by this section is noticed addressed specifically to an administrative patent judge or the Board.

56. Section 1.662 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows:



 1.662



Request for entry of adverse judgment; re-issue filed by patentee.



(a) A party may, at any time during an interference, request and agree to entry of an adverse judgment. The filing by


>

a party

<

 
an applicant or patentee
 of a written disclaimer of the invention defined by a court, concession of priority or unpatentability of the subject
matter of a count, abandonment of the invention defined by a count, or abandonment of the contest as to a count will be
treated as a request for entry of an adverse judgment against the applicant or patentee as to all claims which correspond
to the count. Abandonment of an application 
by an applicant
, other than an 
applicant
 

>

application

<

 for re-issue having a claim of the patent sought to be reissued involved in the interference, will be treated as a request
for entry of an adverse judgment against the applicant as to all claims corresponding to all counts. Upon the filing
by a party of a request for entry of an adverse judgment, the Board may enter judgment against the party.

(b) If a patentee involved in an interference files an application for reissue during the interference and 

>

the reissue application does not include a claim that corresponds to a count

<

 
omits all claims of the patent corresponding to the counts of the interference for the purpose of avoiding the interference

other than for the purpose of avoiding the interference
 shall

57. Section 1.664 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows:



 1.664



Action after interference.



(a) After termination of an interference, the examiner will promptly take such action in any application previously
involved in the interference as may be necessary. Unless entered by order of an 

>

administrative patent judge

<

 
examiner-in-chief
, amendments presented during the interference shall not be entered, but may be subsequently presented by the applicant
subject to the provisions of this subpart provided prosecution of the application is not otherwise closed.

(b) After judgment, the application of any party may be held subject to further examination, including an interference
with another application.

58. Section 1.671 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(6), (c)(7), (f) and (g)

<

 
 
(b) 
A party wishing to take the testimony of a witness whose testimony will not be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24 may elect
to present the testimony of the witness by affidavit or deposition.
 A party 
electing to present

presenting

<

 testimony of a witness by affidavit shall, prior to the 
close of the party's relevant testimony period, file and serve
 

>

time set by the administrative patent judge for serving affidavits, file a copy of the

<

 
an
 affidavit 
of the witness or, where appropriate, a notice under  1.671(e). To facilitate preparation of the record ( 1.653
(g) and (h)), a party should file an affidavit on paper which is 81/2 by 11 inches (21.8 by 27.9 cm)
. 

>

If the affidavit relates to a party's case-in-chief, it shall be filed no later than the date set by an administrative
patent judge for the party to file affidavits for its case-in-chief. If the affidavit relates to a party's case-in-rebuttal,
it shall be filed no later than the date set by an administrative patent judge for the party to file affidavits for its
case-in-rebuttal.

<

 A party shall not be entitled to rely on any document referred to in the affidavit unless a copy of the document is filed
with the affidavit. A party shall not be entitled to rely on any thing mentioned in the affidavit unless the opponent
is given reasonable access to the thing. A thing is something other than a document. 

>

The pages of affidavits filed under this paragraph and of any other testimony filed therewith under   1.683(a)
and 1.688(a) shall be given sequential numbers which shall also serve as the record page numbers for the affidavits
and other testimony in the party's record to be filed under  1.653. Exhibits identified in the affidavits or
in any other testimony filed under   1.683(a) and 1.688(a) and any official records and printed publications
filed under  1.682(a) shall be given sequential exhibit numbers which shall also serve as the exhibit numbers
when the exhibits are filed with the party's record. The affidavits, testimony filed under   1.683(a)
and 1.688(a) exhibits shall be accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where
the testimony of each witness begins, and by an index of the exhibits briefly describing the nature of each exhibit
and giving the number of the page where each exhibit is first identified and offered into evidence. 
 
(c) If an opponent objects to the admissibility of any evidence contained, in or submitted with an affidavit filed
under paragraph (b) of this section, the opponent must, no later than the date set by the administrative patent judge
for filing objections under this paragraph, file objections stating with particularity the nature of each objection.
An opponent that fails to challenge the admissibility of the evidence contained in or submitted with an affidavit
on a ground that could have been raised in a timely objection under this paragraph will not be entitled to move under
 1.656(h) to suppress the evidence on that ground. If an opponent timely files objections, the party may, within
20 days of the due date for filing objections, file supplemental affidavits and supplemental official records and
printed publications to overcome the objections. No objection to the admissibility of the supplemental evidence
shall be made, except as provided by  1.656(h). The pages of supplemental affidavits filed under this paragraph
shall be sequentially numbered beginning with the number following the last page number of the party's testimony
submitted under paragraph (b) of this section. The page numbers assigned to the supplemental affidavits shall also
serve as the record page numbers for the supplemental affidavits in the party's record filed under  1.653. Additional
exhibits identified in supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records and printed publications
shall be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last number of the exhibits submitted under
paragraph (b) of this section. The exhibit numbers shall also serve as the exhibit numbers when the exhibits are filed
with the party's record. The supplemental affidavits shall be accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses
and an index of exhibits of the type specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 
 
(d)

<

 After the

affidavit is filed and within a time set by an examiner-in-chief,
 

>

the administrative patent judge shall set a time within which

<

 any opponent may file a request to cross-examine 
the witness
 

>

an affiant

<

 on oral deposition. If any opponent requests cross-examination of an affiant, the party shall notice a deposition


>

at a reasonable location within the United States

<

 under  1.673(e) for the purpose of cross-examination by any opponent. Any redirect and recross shall take place
at the deposition. At any deposition for the purpose of cross-examination of a witness 
whose testimony is presented by affidavit
, the party shall not be entitled to rely on any document or thing not mentioned in one or more of the affidavits filed
under 
this paragraph
 

>

paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section

<

, except to the extent necessary to conduct proper redirect. 
A party electing to present testimony of a witness by deposition shall notice a deposition of the witness under  1.673(a).
 The party who gives notice of a deposition shall be responsible 

>

for providing a translator if the witness does not testify in English,

<

 for obtaining a court reported and for filing a certified transcript of the deposition as required by  1.676.


>

Within 45 days of the close of the period for taking cross-examination, the party shall serve (but not file) a copy of
each transcript on each opponent together with copies of any additional documentary exhibits identified by the witness
during the deposition. The pages of the transcripts served under this paragraph shall be sequentially numbered beginning

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Massachusetts; Amendment to Massachusetts' SIP
(for Ozone and for Carbon Monoxide) for Establishment of a South Boston Parking Freeze




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) amendment submitted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The intent of the SIP amendment is to effect a decrease in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and motor vehicle emissions
by controlling the growth of parking spaces in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston and holding automobile usage
to levels within the practical capacity of the local street network. Vehicular emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons
and nitrogen oxides will be reduced compared with their expected levels if parking is not constrained. These pollutants
contribute to the carbon monoxide and ozone air pollution problems in the Boston urbanized area. This SIP revision
adds the South Boston Parking Freeze Area to ongoing parking management plans in the Metropolitan Boston Area. The
intended effect of this action is to propose approval of the changes to Massachusetts' SIP. This action is being taken
under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 30, 1993, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) submitted a revision to its State
Implementation Plan (SIP) for the South Boston Parking Freeze. The amendment adds or revises four definitions to
310 CMR 7.00 and adds a new section, 310 CMR 7.33 ``MB City of Boston/South Boston Parking Freeze'' to manage the overall
parking demand in South Boston. Specifically, the measure will constrain future parking supply at 10 percent above
1990 levels, allowing for an increase in the supply to accommodate an expected increase in demand accompanying intensive
development in South Boston. A second ten percent increase in parking supply will be permitted in the South Boston
Piers area when the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project is completed and open to the public.



Background



Parking freezes for part of the City of Boston, the City of Cambridge, and Logan Airport were included as one strategy
in the Transportation Control Plan promulgated by the EPA in its plan for the Boston Region in 1975. (See CFR part 52,
subpart W; 38 FR 17689 (July 2, 1973); 38 FR 30960 (November 8, 1973); 40 FR 25162 (June 12, 1975); 40 FR 39863 (August
29, 1975).) On September 16, 1979, EPA approved Massachusetts' 1979 SIP, which included these parking freezes. Massachusetts
reaffirmed these freezes in its 1982 SIP. 
 On December 19, 1990, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (EOTC), the Massachusetts
Department of Public Works ((MDPW), now the Massachusetts Highway Department (MA HWY)) and the Conservation Law
Foundation (CLF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing the parties to pursue implementation, monitoring
and enforcement of traffic, and air quality mitigation measures for the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project.
Parking freezes, including the development and implementation of the South Boston Parking Freeze, were among the
specific measures committed to in the MOU. The Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) voted on December
27, 1990, to adopt the items of the MOU as a State Implementation Plan (SIP) provision, and forwarded the items to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP) as a proposed amendment to the SIP.

The Metropolitan Planning Organization is the current ``State Certified Organization'' for transportation control
measures in the SIP. In response to the MPO submission, MA DEP developed regulations which were proposed in October
of 1992. MA DEP held a public hearing on these amendments on November 30, 1992. The comment period ended December 10,
1992, with oral testimony and written comments received from EPA as well as various other parties. The amendments
(as formal state regulations) were filed with Massachusetts Secretary of State on March 15, 1993, and became effective
on April 9, 1993, upon publication in the Massachusetts Register. 


Summary of SIP Revision





(1) Geographic Area.

 The South Boston Parking Freeze area is divided into three zones defined as: (i) The South Boston Piers Zone; (ii) the
South Boston Industrial/Commercial Zone; and (iii) the South Boston Residential Zone. The boundaries of these zones
are defined in the state regulation as well as in EPA's Technical Support Document (TSD) available in the docket for
this action.



(2) Definition of the Parking Freeze.

 There is a freeze (limit) on the availability of motor vehicle parking spaces within the South Boston Piers Zone and
the Industrial/Commercial Zone, and a freeze on the availability of remote parking spaces within the South Boston
Residential Zone.

1

 In addition, the South Boston Piers Zone will have ten percent of its off-street spaces set aside and allocated for
off-peak period parking. Off-peak spaces would not be used by everyday commuters but reserved for people needing
short term parking. Therefore, parking spaces designated for off-peak use may not be used between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30
a.m., but could be used at other times. Once the South Boston Transitway opens, additional spaces in the South Boston
Piers Zone will be set aside for off-peak parking, resulting in a total of 20 percent off-peak parking spaces. Finally,
a second ten percent will be created and added to the Freeze Bank for the South Boston Piers Zone when the Central Artery/Third
Harbor Tunnel opens to the public.





The Massachusetts regulation requires the Boston Air Pollution Control Commission (BAPCC) and Massachusetts Port
Authority (Massport) to develop and submit an inventory of all existing motor vehicle parking spaces for each of their
respective areas. In addition, all motor vehicle parking spaces that were part of any project submitted for review
under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) process in 301 CMR 11.00, or the Federal Environmental Review
Process in 40 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

 as of August 1, 1990, as well as remote parking spaces, must be identified in their respective inventories. This inventory
will identify parking spaces for commercial, remote, employee, restricted use, off-peak uses and parking spaces
eliminated during the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project construction within the freeze area.

The Massachusetts Regulation authorizes BAPCC to allow ``restricted use parking'' spaces in the South Boston Piers
and Industrial/Commercial zones for up to ten days each year. These spaces are designed to allow the cap to be exceeded
on a very short-term basis to accommodate unusual events. Massport is prohibited from providing restricted use parking
in South Boston.
 
A South Boston Parking Freeze Draft Base Inventory was developed by the BAPCC in accordance with the state regulation
and was submitted to MA DEP for review, public comment and approval. BAPCC's April 1994 Draft Base Inventory estimated
27,768 motor vehicle parking spaces within the South Boston Parking Freeze Area. This is broken down as: South Boston
Piers Zone 15,916 spaces: South Boston Industrial Zone 11,841 spaces; and South Boston Residential Zone 11 spaces.
On June 13, 1994, MA DEP found BAPCC's parking inventory inadequate and required BAPCC to resolve those inadequacies.

 

(3) Establishment of Parking Freeze Banks.

 The number of Motor vehicle parking spaces in the South Boston Parking Freeze Area will be limited to the base inventory,
plus an initial parking freeze bank equal to 10% of the base inventory of motor vehicles parking spaces. There will
be two parking freeze banks, administered separately by the BAPCC and Massport. Motor vehicle parking spaces eliminated
from use in the South Boston Parking Freeze Area can be credited to the appropriate parking freeze bank for reallocation
and are not privately transferrable.



Goals of the Parking Freeze



MA DEP expects that the parking freeze will ensure that economic growth in South Boston occurs efficiently with respect
to land use and transportation infrastructure and in the most environmentally beneficial way. MA DEP stated that
the South Boston Parking Freeze has been designed with the following specific objectives: to improve air quality
over forecast levels, in the metropolitan Boston area and locally, by limiting the growth in traffic congestion so
Federal health-related air quality standards can be attained as rapidly as possible; to reduce traffic on South Boston
neighborhood streets; to manage the parking supply so that transportation and land resources are used efficiently;
to build in flexibility to respond to the changes in traffic capacity resulting from the Central Artery/Third Harbor
Tunnel project; and to encourage transit as the preferred transportation access mode for all new development in the
South Boston area.


Air Quality Impacts



The South Boston Parking Freeze is designed to reduce the growth of VMT and travel-related air emissions by controlling
the growth of parking spaces serving South Boston. The freeze will result in air quality improvements beyond those
which would occur in the future without this measure.

For the three South Boston zones, MA DEP expects the proposed freeze to reduce total future trips by 15,220 per day or
19 percent of the approximately 80,105 trips forecast with unconstrained parking. This is a 5.3 percent reduction
in the future year trips without the freeze in the Central Artery Study area, and a 0.3 percent reduction overall in
Eastern Massachusetts.

Without the South Boston freeze, the amount of VMT increases in the South Boston zones are large. On average in the three
South Boston zones, MA DEP expects trips to rise by about 35 percent between now and the year 2010. Based on vehicle trip
reductions and the related VMT change, a reduction of 8.06 percent in VMT is obtained below the level which would otherwise
occur with unconstrained parking within the Central Artery Study area, and 0.3 percent over the entire region.

Using EPA's Mobile Emission Factor Model (MOBILE4.1, the current version at the time of the MA DEP's analysis) and
the Central Artery Traffic Model, the South Boston Parking Freeze would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) by approximately 74.86 kilograms per day by the year 2010 within the Central Artery Study area. Carbon Monoxide
emissions would be reduced by 558.50 kilograms per day within the Central Artery Study area. Using the EPA MOBILE4.1
emission Model and the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS) regional transportation model, the South Boston
Parking Freeze will reduce emissions of VOCs by 269.79 kilograms per day, and of carbon monoxide (CO) by approximately
1,663.91 kilograms per day within Eastern Massachusetts. The regional model also accounts for the secondary effects
of reducing traffic, which will in turn reduce congestion and emissions elsewhere in the region.

EPA supports the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan as a means to reduce VMT and ultimately eliminate motor vehicle emissions
associated with reduced VMT. The VMT reduction anticipated with implementing the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan
will be accounted for through Highway Performance Monitoring System's (HPMS) statistical sampling of VMT within
the Boston Metropolitan area. VMT reductions resulting from the South Boston freeze will be documented by Massachusetts
in their emission inventories and regional emission analysis (prepared for transportation conformity) and result
in improved ambient air quality. Specific emission credit associated with the South Boston Parking Freeze Plan is
not being assigned in the SIP. In addition, because Massachusetts will account for VMT and emission benefits in their
base scenario, Massachusetts' Reasonable Further Progress Plan does not identify the South Boston Parking Freeze
as an emission reduction element or as a contingency measure.

EPA's review of this material indicates that the proposed SIP amendment will result in improved air quality. EPA is
proposing to approve the Massachusetts SIP revision for South Boston Parking Freeze, which was submitted on July
30, 1993. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this proposal or on other relevant matters.
These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal
rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this action. 


Proposed Action


EPA is proposing to approve the South Boston Parking Freeze SIP Amendment.
 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 revisions (54 FR 2222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a
permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements
ofsections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K) and 110(l) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

Clean Air Act Proposed Full Approval of Operating Permits Program; State of Mississippi



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed full approval.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to grant full approval to the Operating Permits Program submitted by the State of Mississippi for
the purpose of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs
for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background and Purpose



A. Introduction



As required under title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, (Clean Air Act (``Act'') sections 501-507),
EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and
the corresponding standards and procedures by which EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating
permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all
major stationary sources and to certain other sources.

The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section
502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program
substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period
of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim
program, it must establish and implement a Federal operating permits program.



II. Proposed Action and Implications



A. Analysis of State Submission



1. Support Materials 


Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments), the Governor of each State must develop
and submit to the Administrator an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact
meeting the requirements of title V of the Act. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) requested,
under the signature of Governor Kirk Fordice, approval of its operating permits program with full authority to administer
the program in all areas of the State of Mississippi, with the exceptions of the Indian reservations and tribal lands.

In the MDEQ operating permits program submittal, Mississippi does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations
for purposes of 40 CFR part 70 and title V. EPA will, at a future date, conduct a Federal title V operating permits program
governing title V sources of air emissions on Indian lands and reservations in Mississippi.

 
The Mississippi submittal, provided as Section I-''Program Description and Implementation Summary,'' addresses
40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) by describing how the MDEQ intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations.
The program description has been deemed to be sufficient for meeting the requirement of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1).
 
Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General (or the
attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate
authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of Mississippi submitted an Attorney
General's Opinion and a Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating adequate legal authority as required
by Federal law and regulation.
 
Section 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit application forms, permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its
permit program. Appendix 10 of the MDEQ submittal includes the permit application form, and it has been determined
that the application form meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.5(c).

EPA intends to develop an Implementation Agreement with Mississippi, although this proposed action does not depend
on the Implementation Agreement. 



2. Regulations and Program Implementation



The State of Mississippi has submitted Regulations APC-S-6, ``Mississippi Air Emissions Operating Permit
Regulations for the purposes of title V of the Federal Clean Air Act,'' for implementing the State part 70 program as
required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was included in Appendices
7 and 12 of the submittal. Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program,
including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. 
 
The Mississippi operating permits regulations followed part 70 very closely. The following requirements, set out
in EPA's part 70 operating permits program review, are addressed in Section II of the State's submittal: (A) Applicability
requirements, (40 CFR 70.3(a)): APC-S-6, Section I.B; (B) Permit applications, (40 CFR 70.5): APC-S-6,
Section II; (C) Provisions for permit content, (40 CFR 70.6): standard permit requirements: APC-S-6, Section
III.A.1; permit duration: APC-S-6, Section III.A.2; monitoring and related record keeping and reporting
requirements: APC-S-6, Section III.A.3; compliance requirements: APC-S-6, Sections III.B and III.C;
(D) Operational flexibility provisions, (40 CFR 70.4(b)(12)): APC-S-6, Section IV.F; (E) Provisions for
permit issuance, renewals, reopenings and revisions, including public participation (40 CFR 70.7): APC-S-6,
Section IV; and (F) Permit review by EPA and affected States (40 CFR 70.6): APC-S-6, Section V. Mississippi Code
Annotated (MSCA) sections 49-17-36 and 49-17-43, satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 70.11,
for enforcement authority. 
The MDEQ has included criteria to determine insignificant activities and emissions levels in APC-S-6, Section
VII. Section VII.A includes activities/emissions sources which are not required to be included in the permit application.
Section VII.B includes activities/emissions sources that must be listed in the permit application, but their emissions
do not have to be quantified. Notwithstanding Sections VII.A and B, applicants are required to include all emission
sources and quantify emissions if needed to determine major source compliance with an applicable requirement, or
to collect any permit fee. Applicants shall also include all emission sources with a potential to emit greater than
1 pound per hour of any regulated air pollutant that is not a hazardous air pollutant, or greater than 0.1 pound per hour
of any hazardous air pollutant.

Part 70 of the operating permits regulations requires prompt reporting of deviations from the permit requirements.
Section 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) requires the permitting authority to define prompt in relation to the degree and type
of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements. Although the permit program regulations should define
prompt for purposes of administrative efficiency and clarity, an acceptable alternative is to define prompt in each
individual permit. EPA believes that prompt should generally be defined as requiring reporting within two to ten
days of the deviation. Two to ten days is sufficient time in most cases to protect public health and safety as well as
to provide a forewarning of potential problems. For sources with a low level of excess emissions, a longer time period
may be acceptable. However, prompt reporting must be more frequent than the semiannual reporting requirement, given
that this is a distinct reporting obligation under 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). Where ``prompt'' is defined in the
individual permit but not in the program regulations, EPA may veto permits that do not require sufficiently prompt
reporting of deviations. The State of Mississippi has not defined prompt in its program regulations with respect
to reporting of deviations. The MDEQ, however, has committed to define ``prompt'' as discussed above in each individual
permit.

The State statute (MSCA 49-2-9) contains a provision that allows the State to adopt, modify, repeal, and
promulgate, after due notice and hearing, and where not otherwise prohibited by Federal or State law, to make exceptions
to and grant exceptions and variances from, and to enforce rules and regulations implementing or effectuating the
powers and duties of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality under any and all statutes within the Commission's
jurisdiction, and as the Commission may deem necessary to prevent, control and abate existing or potential pollution.
Regulation APC-S-6, Section I.B.8 prohibits exceptions or variances to be granted from any of the regulations
regarding title V permits. The program submittal is approvable based on these limitations placed on the state's variance
provision.

The complete MDEQ program submittal and the Technical Support Document are available for review for more detailed
information.



3. Permit Fee Demonstration



MSCA sections 49-17-14 and 49-17-30 require the establishment of a permit fee sufficient
to cover the reasonable direct and indirect costs of the title V operating permit program. The fee amount is set annually
by order of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality and is based on either actual or allowable emissions
at the request of the source. Under State law, the minimum annual fee assessment is set at $250 and the maximum annual
fee assessment is set at $250,000.

The MDEQ has elected to assess a title V operating permit fee below the Federal presumptive minimum permit fee. Mississippi's
fee amount was determined through a detailed fee demonstration study that was conducted by the John C. Stennis Institute
of Government at Mississippi State University. The basis of the fee demonstration was a comprehensive workload analysis
for the title V program.

Based on the results of the fee demonstration study, the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality issued
an Order setting the title V fee at $23.39 per ton of regulated air pollutants for the first year of the title V program.
The fee may be adjusted annually by Order of the Commission to account for inflation factors or changing program costs.
EPA has determined that Mississippi's fee demonstration is adequate and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 70.9. 



4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 





a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.

 Mississippi has demonstrated in its title V program submittal broad legal authority to incorporate into permits
and enforce all applicable requirements. Additionally, the State has adopted APC-S-1, Section 8, ``Provisions
for Hazardous Air Pollutants,'' which provides adequate legal authority to implement and enforce applicable section
112 rules, emission standards, and requirements. Mississippi has further supplemented its broad legal authority
with a commitment to ``take action, following promulgation by EPA of regulations implementing section 112 of title
III of the Federal Clean Air Act, and to submit, for EPA approval, MDEQ regulations implementing these provisions.''
EPA has determined that this commitment, in conjunction with Mississippi's broad statutory and regulatory authority,
adequately assures compliance with all section 112 requirements. EPA regards this commitment as an acknowledgement
by Mississippi of its obligation to obtain further regulatory authority as needed to issue permits that assure compliance
with section 112 applicable requirements. This commitment does not substitute for compliance with part 70 requirements
that must be met at the time of program approval.

EPA is interpreting the above legal authority and commitment to mean that Mississippi is able to carry out all section
112 activities. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this proposed full approval and the April 13, 1993 guidance memorandum entitled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria
for Section 112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.



b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.

 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Mississippi is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of MACT or offsets under section
112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific
basis. EPA is proposing to approve Mississippi's preconstruction permitting program found in APC-S-2 under
the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period
between title V approval and adoption of a State rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes
this approval is necessary so that Mississippi has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions
for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Section 112(l) provides the authority for approval
for the use of State air programs to implement 112(g), and title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited
approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval
is narrowly limited to section 112(g), and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under
the Act. If Mississippi does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and
can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, EPA may, in the final action approving
Mississippi's part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.

This approval only extends until such time as the State is able to adopt regulations consistent with any regulations
promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval
to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Mississippi, acting expeditiously,
will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. EPA is proposing here to limit the
duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations.



c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.

 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 General Provisions Subpart A and standards as promulgated by EPA as they
apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate
resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70.
Therefore, EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program
for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated,
and to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for part 70 sources.

1

 Mississippi has informed EPA that it intends to accept delegation of section 112 standards through adoption by reference.
This program applies to both existing and future standards.





Additionally, Mississippi has requested delegation of current and future section 112 standards under section 112(l)(5)
and 40 CFR 63.91 for sources not subject to part 70 requirements. The State has demonstrated that it has broad legal
authority which covers all section 112 sources. MSCA sections 49-2-9 and 49-17-29(a), and
APC-S-1 section 8, give the State the authority to implement each applicable section 112 rule, emission standard,
or requirement for sources not subject to part 70 requirements. Mississippi has demonstrated that it will expeditiously
implement section 112 requirements for these sources pursuant to a schedule after EPA promulgation, and that it has
sufficient enforcement authority to adequately enforce section 112 requirements. The State has also demonstrated
that it has adequate resources to implement current section 112 standards. With respect to future section 112 requirements,
Mississippi has committed to provide EPA with future demonstrations of resource adequacy as necessary when new requirements
are promulgated and the resource burdens associated with those requirements become known. Therefore, for sources
not subject to part 70 requirements, EPA is proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of
the State's program for receiving delegation of future section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated, and to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for non-part 70 sources.
 


d. Commitment to implement Title IV of the Act.

 The MDEQ has committed to ``take action, following promulgation by EPA of regulations implementing sections 407
and 410 of the Act, or revising either part 72 or the regulations implementing sections 407 or 410, to either incorporate
such new revised provisions by reference or submit, for EPA approval, MDEQ regulations implementing these provisions.''
The MDEQ committed to adopt and submit to EPA the above referenced regulations no later than January 1, 1995. 



B. Proposed Actions



1. Full Approval of the Program



EPA proposes to fully approve the operating permits program submitted to EPA from the State of Mississippi on November
15, 1993. As a condition of full approval, Mississippi has issued a commitment to EPA which confirms that the State's
interpretation of a ``title I modification'' is consistent with EPA's current interpretation of that term. In addition,
the State's regulatory definition is on its face consistent with EPA's interpretation. See APC-S-6, Section
I.A.31. EPA believes the better interpretation of the phrase ``modifications under any provision of title I of the
Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) to mean literally any change at a source that would trigger permitting authority
review under regulations approved or promulgated under title I of the Act. This would include State preconstruction
review programs approved into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) under section 110(a)(2)(C) and regulations addressing
source changes that trigger National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) established pursuant
to section 112 prior to the 1990 amendments. EPA is soliciting comment in the current proposal to revise part 70 on the
proper definition of ``title I modification.'' Unless Mississippi changes its own interpretation from that indicated
in its commitment, the program will be fully approvable under either option discussed in that proposal. See 56 FR 44460,
44515 (August 29, 1994). EPA has determined that the program is otherwise adequate to meet the minimum elements of
a State operating permits program as specified in 40 CFR part 70.



2. Program for Straight Delegation of Section 112 Standards 



As discussed above in section II.A.4.c, EPA is proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91
of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards
as promulgated. This program for delegations applies to all section 112 sources. Additionally, EPA is proposing
to delegate existing standards under 40 CFR parts 61 and 63 for all section 112 sources.



III. Administrative Requirements 


A. Request for Public Comments



EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed full approval. Copies of the State's submittal and other
information relied upon for the proposed full approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office.
The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in
the development of this proposed full approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:



(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the approval process; and
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. EPA will consider any comments received by November 2, 1994.



B. Executive Order 12866



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from executive order 12866 review.



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The EPA's actions under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits
programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because this action does not impose any new requirements,
it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.



List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 70



Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Intergovernmental
relations, Operating permits, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.






Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation





36 CFR Part 800
Protection of Historic Properties; Proposed Rule









Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 190  Monday, October 3, 1994  Proposed Rules




<USDEPT>ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION</USDEPT>


<USDEPT>36 CFR Part 800</USDEPT>



Protection of Historic Properties


Agency: 

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.



Action: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking; revision of current regulations.





Summary: 

The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) is proposing changes to its regulations in order to implement
the 1992 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act and to improve the Section 106 process, by which Federal
agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. The proposed changes seek to balance
the interests and concerns of various users of the Section 106 process, including Federal agencies, State Historic
Preservation Officers (SHPOs), Native Americans and Native Hawaiians, and the public. The revised regulations
also respond to the new Section 110 provisions in the 1992 amendments which require Federal agencies to establish
historic preservation programs.



Dates: 

Comments must be received on or before December 2, 1994. In recognition of the unique trust and treaty relationships
between the United States Government and Indian tribes, their enhanced role in the Section 106 process as directed
by the National Historic Preservation Act amendments of 1992, and the possibility that some tribes will need more
than 60 days to provide comments, the Council will provide on request an additional 30 days for an Indian tribe to submit
comments. A representative of the tribal government must file such request with the Council no later than December
2, 1994.



Addresses: 

Comments should be addressed to the Executive Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania
Avenue, Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004. Fax 202-606-8647.



For Further Information Contact: 

Stephanie Woronowicz, Information Assistant, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004 (202) 606-8503.


Supplementary Information:
I. Background


Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C.  470f, requires Federal
agencies to take into account the effect of their undertakings on properties included in or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places and to afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings.
Public Law 102-575 was enacted in October, 1992, and contains amendments to the National Historic Preservation
Act which affect the way Section 106 review is carried out under the Council's regulations. Furthermore, as part of
the Administration's National Performance Review, the Council undertook a review of the current regulatory process
to identify potential changes that could improve the operation of the Section 106 process and conform it to the principles
of this Administration. The Council commenced an information-gathering effort to assess the current Section 106
process and to identify desirable changes.
As a part of this effort, the Council sent a questionnaire to 1,200 users of the Section 106 process, including Federal
agencies, SHPOs, State and local governments, applicants for Federal assistance, Native Americans, preservation
groups, contractors involved in the process, and members of the public. The questionnaires sought opinions on the
current regulatory process and ideas for enhancing the process. The Council received over 400 responses. After analyzing
the responses and holding several meetings with Federal Preservation Officers and SHPOs, the Council staff presented
its preliminary findings to a special Council member Task Force comprised of the Department of Transportation, the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Native
American representative William Tallbull, expert member Jane Davidson, and Council chairman Cathryn Buford Slater.

The key findings presented to and adopted by the Regulations Task Force were the following: (1) Federal agencies and
SHPOs should be given greater authority to conclude Section 106 review; (2) the Council should spend more time monitoring
program trends and overall performance of Federal agencies and SHPOs and less time reviewing individual cases or
participating in case-specific consultation; (3) Section 106 review requirements should be integrated with environmental
review required by other statutes; (4) enforcement of Section 106 should be increased and specific remedies should
be provided for failure to comply; and (5) there should be expanded opportunities for public involvement in the Section
106 process.


II. Summary of Regulatory Changes


Consistent with the findings adopted by the Council Regulations Task Force, the Council proposes to revise its regulations
as follows:


Subpart A_Background and Policy


This Subpart adds a new section describing the goals of the consultation process (Section 800.1(b)) and clarifying
the roles of participants in the Section 106 process, particularly those of Native Americans and Native Hawaiians
(Section 800.1(e)) as required by the 1992 NHPA amendments. The provision regarding Native American and Native Hawaiian
participation provides detailed guidance on how Federal agency officials consult with Native American and Native
Hawaiian organizations that attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected
by an undertaking (Section 800.1(e)(5)). The section on participants in the Section 106 process also elaborates
on the role and rights of the public to participate in the process (Section 800.6(e)(6)). In order to encourage consideration
of historic properties as early in the planning stages as possible, the regulations specifically set forth a section
on timing (Section 800.6(c)).
Subpart A also adds new definitions and revises current definitions to conform to the 1992 NHPA amendments and to clarify
terms which have raised questions during the implementation of the Section 106 process (Section 800.2). New definitions
include: agency, anticipatory demolition, approval of the expenditure of funds, comment, conditional no adverse
effect agreement, consultation, Council membership, foreclosure, head of the agency, memorandum of agreement,
Native Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian organization, notice of violation, traditional community, and traditional cultural
authority. Revised definitions include: agency official, area of potential effects, historic property, Indian
tribe, interested (party) person, Indian (tribal) lands, and undertaking. The definition of undertaking has been
changed to accord with the intent of the statutory definition provided in the 1992 NHPA amendments.


Subpart B_Federal Procedures to Implement Section 106

The Council has added new provisions to assist agencies in 
meeting their responsibilities under the statutory 
requirement in Section 110(a)(2) of the 1992 NHPA amendments 
which requires agencies to develop preservation programs and 
to ensure that the agencies' procedures for compliance with 
Section 106 are consistent with the Council's procedures 
(Sections 800.3-800.6). The provisions implement the 
principle that agency procedures establishing a preservation 
program must be consistent with the Council's regulations by 
providing standards for consistency (Section 800.4) and 
processes through which the Council can evaluate whether 
these standards have been met (Section 800.5 and 800.6). 


Subpart C_The Section 106 Process 


The heart of the Section 106 process is in Subpart C. The 
provisions in this Subpart have changed to allow for more 
agency-SHPO decisionmaking without Council involvement. To 
offset the Council's removal from routine cases, this 
Subpart gives the Council the authority to resolve disputes 
between Federal agencies and SHPOs and to monitor agency 
performance and provides an expanded opportunity for the 
public to request the Council to intervene in particular 
cases. 
Section 800.7(a-e) sets forth the steps that an agency 
official must go through prior to the identification of 
historic properties. These provisions emphasize the need 
for early planning and coordination, both with reviews under 
other authorities and with other individuals and 
organizations, prior to the initiation of the identification 
stage. The identification and evaluation stages (Section 
800.8) remain essentially the same as the present 
regulations, except that the regulation adds a provision 
allowing for Council review of agency decisions made during 
the identification and evaluation stages (Section 800.8(e)). 
As a supplement to Section 800.8, a non-binding Appendix has 
been added to provide additional clarification on the 
identification process and the establishment of the area of 
potential effects. 
The revised regulations eliminate the determination of 
effect step (and the existing Criteria of Effect) currently 
in the Section 106 process and allow an agency to apply the 
criteria of adverse effect directly after completing the 
identification stage (Section 800.9(a)). An agency is no 
longer required to notify the Council of a finding of no 
adverse effect, but the Council may review such a finding if 
requested or if the Council deems it appropriate (Section 
800.9(d)). The revised regulations also eliminate the 
exceptions to a finding of adverse effect and incorporate 
those exceptions into a new provision allowing for 
conditional no adverse effect agreements (Section 
800.9(b)(2)). The intent of the addition of the conditional 
no adverse effect agreement provision is to allow agencies 
and SHPOs flexibility in reaching routine agreements while 
maintaining agency accountability. It formally recognizes a 
practice that has already become widespread under the 
current regulations. 
In order to resolve adverse effects more efficiently, the 
revised regulations provide more autonomy to the SHPO and 
the Federal agency. The revised regulations establish a 
method for resolution of adverse effects without the 
Council's participation, changing the current two-party 
Memorandum of Agreement process (Sections 800.10(a)(1) and 
800.10(c)(1)). Under this provision, if the Council elects 
not to participate in the negotiation, the agency and the 
SHPO may execute a Memorandum of Agreement which is sent to 
the Council, but need not be executed by the Council 
(Section 800.10(c)(1)). The revised regulations also 
clarify the use, force and effect of a Memorandum of 
Agreement and its provisions (Section 800.10(d)). 
If a Memorandum of Agreement cannot be reached during two-party consultation, the parties must seek the Council's

participation and enter three-party consultation before 
terminating negotiations. If a Memorandum of Agreement 
cannot be reached, the revised regulations set forth more 
detailed provisions on termination of negotiations and 
Council comments (Section 800.11)). With regard to Council 
comments, the new regulations require that the head of the 
agency respond to the Council's comments in accordance with 
Section 110(l) of the NHPA. 
In responding to comments made by respondents to the 
Council's survey of Section 106 users and in order to 
balance the Council's removal from routine Section 106 
cases, the revised regulations establish a new section on 
agency monitoring and compliance (Section 800.12). This 
section provides for the review of an agency official's 
findings, providing more detail than the review procedures 
contained in the current regulations at Section 800.6(e). 
The monitoring and compliance section also includes a new 
provision for the issuance of a notice of violation to an 
agency which has violated or, in the case of a preliminary 
notice of violation, is about to violate the requirements of 
the NHPA. In response to the 1992 amendments which added 
Section 110(k), the Council has established procedures 
addressing anticipatory demolition. 


Subpart D_Alternative Procedures 


This Subpart provides options for complying with the 
requirements of Section 106 other than those set forth in 
Subpart C. Its purpose is to encourage agencies to integrate 
the Section 106 process into their internal planning 
procedures. Section 800.16 of the revised regulations 
explains that counterpart procedures, as described in 
Sections 800.4 and 800.5(a), Programmatic Agreements, as 
described in Section 800.5(b), provide alternative means of 
compliance. In accordance with Section 101(d)(5) of the 
NHPA, the Council has added a new provision to establish a 
process by which an Indian tribe may substitute its tribal 
historic preservation regulations for the Council's 
regulations for review of undertakings on tribal lands 
(Section 800.17). The Council has also attempted to address 
the unique situations created by disasters or emergencies 
and has revised its emergency regulations to emphasize the 
need for the development of agency counterpart procedures 
which establish a plan for considering historic properties 
during responses to disasters and emergencies. The revised 
emergency regulations delete reference to 36 CFR Part 78 in 
order to encourage agencies to develop their own procedures 
for dealing with disasters. The Council has limited the 
applicability of the regulations to natural disasters or 
emergencies declared by the President or by an Agency 
Official. 


Subpart E_Coordination With Other Authorities 


As an expansion and revision of the current regulations 
regarding agency coordination, requested by surveyed users, 
the revised regulations establish more detailed guidance on 
coordination with the National Environmental Policy Act and 
indicate other relevant statutes where coordination is 
desirable (Section 800.19). 


III. Issues Deserving Special Attention From Commenters 


In the development of these revisions, the Council 
determined that several issues warranted special attention 
from commenters. These issues fall into three categories: 
(1) areas of particular concern to the Council on which the 
views of users and the public are particularly solicited; 
(2) provisions that could be drafted in one or more 
alternative ways and views are sought on the best 
alternative; and (3) questions about actions that could be 
taken to improve the functioning of the Section 106 process, 
but that would not be specifically included in the 
regulations. The Council invites commenters to give these 
issues special consideration and provide views for its use.

1. Agency Implementing Procedures 


Section 110(a)(2)(E)(i) of the NHPA requires that each 
Federal agency have procedures for compliance with Section 
106 that are consistent with the Council's regulations. The 
Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of 
the National Park Service, and the Council share oversight 
for this provision, since the Secretary is charged with 
providing guidance on implementing Section 110 
responsibilities. The Council wishes to encourage Federal 
agencies to develop such procedures to adapt the Section 106 
process to their particular needs and to better integrate 
Section 106 into their regular planning processes. Subpart 
B of the revised regulations sets forth criteria for 
evaluating consistency; outlines a process for Council 
review of such procedures; and defines the consequences of a 
Council finding regarding consistency. Does the proposed 
process meet the need for agency program oversight? Are 
there ways the regulations could better encourage Federal 
agencies to adopt the required procedures in a timely 
manner? Are there better alternatives to the proposed 
consistency standards and review process? Are the criteria 
appropriate to meet the objective on achieving internal 
Federal agency procedures that effectively implement Section 
106? 


2. Exemption of Certain Undertakings From the Section 106 
Process 


As part of the development of agency procedures to implement 
Section 106, the proposed regulations include a new 
provision that will allow agencies to waive the Section 106 
review for categories of undertakings which generally would 
not have an effect on historic properties. Since the use of 
categorical exclusions has been a major component of the 
NEPA process, there is the potential that this provision may 
be confusing. Further, approval of such a listing may 
incorrectly infer that the exemption of a class of 
undertakings means that an included undertaking could never 
result in adverse effect to historic properties. Should the 
procedures for categorical exemptions be included in the 
revised regulations? Should they be further distinguished 
from NEPA categorical exclusions to avoid confusion? Are 
the criteria for categorical exemptions too broad or too 
narrow? Should parties other than the agency and the 
Council be able to require individual Section 106 reviews 
for undertakings previously listed as categorical 
exclusions? 


3. Regulation Versus Guidance 


When surveyed, users of the current Section 106 regulations 
generally requested more specificity and guidance on various 
provisions of the regulations. The revised regulations 
respond to that concern. Are the regulatory provisions 
sufficiently detailed or have they become too specific? 
Where should any changes be made? Should some existing 
material or additional material be set forth in appendices 
to the regulations or in separate, subsequently issued 
guidance documents? 


4. Public Participation 


The proposed regulations rely heavily on increased access 
for the public to the Section 106 process to offset the 
Council's reduced role in individual cases. These enhanced 
opportunities for public involvement anticipate both a 
greater public role in shaping decisions regarding the 
treatment of effects on historic properties and a more 
active watchdog function for the public to ensure that 
procedures are followed and decisions are made properly. 
Conversely, expanded public participation can impose burdens 
on Federal planning processes and adequate opportunities for 
public input often require that extra efforts and time be 
expended by Federal officials. The revised regulations 
attempt to strike a balance between these two extremes, with 
an emphasis on public access to the process. Has this 
balance been struck effectively? Are there specific places 
where public notification or participation should be 
strengthened or reduced? Should the regulations be more 
specific on public participation or should additional 
guidance be provided in less formal channels, such as 
guidance documents? 


5. Role of Certain Interested Parties 


The proposed regulations seek to clarify and enhance the 
involvement of individuals and organizations that have 
significant interests in the negotiating process designed to 
avoid or minimize adverse effects (See Section 
800.10(b)(1)). One such group is owners of properties 
affected by the undertaking and whose interests may be 
impacted by decisions made in the Section 106 process 
regarding the avoidance or mitigation of the undertaking's 
adverse effects on historic properties. The proposed 
regulations allow all owners of affected properties to 
participate in negotiations for a Memorandum of Agreement, 
provided that the Council can limit participation to a 
representative if the number of owners desiring to 
participate becomes unwieldy. Is this a reasonable balance 
of access and procedural efficiency? Should only owners of 
historic properties be given this status? How broadly 
should ``affected'' be defined? 


6. Substitution of State and Local Review Processes for 
These Regulations. 


The current regulations allow a Certified Local Government 
(CLG), as established under Section 101(c)(1) of the NHPA, 
to assume the role of the State Historic Preservation 
Officer (SHPO) in the Section 106 review when the Council, 
SHPO, and local government are in agreement. The proposed 
regulations delete this provision, in the interest of 
avoiding too many variations on the Section 106 process and 
resultant confusion. Should the current role of CLGs be 
maintained? Should it be expanded to allow review 
procedures established under local law and administered by a 
CLG to substitute for the Council's regulations? Should the 
regulations require Federal agencies to routinely consult 
with CLGs in addition to or in lieu of consultation with 
SHPOs? The current regulations allow State review systems to 
substitute for the Federal process under certain 
circumstances. The revised regulations delete this. Should 
it be retained and, if so, should it be modified from its 
current form?

7. Role of the Federal Preservation Officer 


Section 110(c) of the NHPA requires Federal agencies to 
designate an official to be responsible for coordinating the 
agency's activities under the NHPA. However, the position 
and function of the Federal Preservation Officer (FPO) vary 
widely from agency to agency and the revised regulations are 
currently silent on the issue. Given the key role the NHPA 
intends for the FPO to play as a central agency-wide 
coordinator, should the Section 106 regulations define a 
role for the FPO? If so, should it be with regard to all 
individual project review, terminations where Council member 
comment is sought (Section 800.11), the development of 
agency procedures (Subpart B) or something else? 


8. Disputes Over Application of the Regulations 



When surveyed, users reported a serious shortcoming in the 
current regulations with the lack of any process to resolve 
disputes over when Section 106 applies and over the various 
determinations made in the Section 106 process. The 
proposed regulations authorize the Council to do this at 
several points. These include whether an action is an 
``undertaking'' (Section 800.7(a)), what the area of potential 
effects is (Section 800.8(a)), whether historic properties 
are present (Section 800.8(e)) and whether documentation to 
support agency determinations is adequate (Section 
800.14(f)). Such determinations would be legally binding 
for purposes of Section 106. Alternatives to Council 
resolution include giving the Federal agency the authority 
to make these determinations, referring the matter to a 
third party such as the Office of Management and Budget or 
the Justice Department or continuing the current situation 
where the absence of a recognized administrative 
decisionmaker leaves resolution to the Federal courts, but 
only if a formal legal challenge is made. Is the proposed 
system the best alternative? 



9. Reviews and Appeals 


There are several points in the current Section 106 
regulations which provide an opportunity for Council review 
of agency decisions and for public appeals to the Council. 
The proposed regulations expand the right to appeal Federal 
agency decisions to the Council by giving the public a broad 
right to request review of an agency decision, although the 
Council may determine that the request is not timely. (See 
Section 800.12(a)(1).) This expanded appeal process is 
intended to serve as a balance for the Council's withdrawal 
from regular involvement in agency-SHPO decisions in the 
Section 106 process. While the regulation (Section 
800.12(a)(1)) allows an agency to go forward with an 
undertaking while the Council conducts its review, the 
open-endedness of the appeals process diminishes the 
finality of Section 106 compliance for Federal agencies. Is 
the appeals mechanism as proposed an effective means to 
balance the Council's reduced role in the review of 
individual undertakings? Should it be broader or narrower? 
Could the provision be revised to give a greater degree of 
finality to the process and also afford the public fair 
access to the Council? 



10. Notice of Violation 


The proposed regulations authorize the Council to issue a 
preliminary or final notice of violation when the Council 
determines that a Federal agency has acted in violation of 
Section 106 or the Council's regulations. (See Section 
800.12(d).) Under the current regulations, the Council may 
inform an agency when it finds the agency in violation, or 
in danger of violation, of Section 106 and the Council's 
regulations, but such action lacks any official sanction 
under the regulations and is viewed as purely advisory. The 
concept of a formal notice of violation, adapted from other 
Federal environmental protection processes, is in response 
to widespread concern that the current regulations lack 
effective means of enforcement. Is the proposed notice of 
violation an appropriate method? Are there other techniques 
or actions within the Council's legal authority to achieve 
this objective? Would the presence of stronger enforcement 
tools encourage the fulfillment of Section 106 
responsibilities? 



11. Treatment of Archeological Resources 


The revised regulations continue the policy of the current 
regulations with regard to providing expedited review for 
undertakings with effects limited to archeological 
resources. The current process allows such cases to be 
processed as No Adverse Effect Determinations, provided that 
the values of the resource are limited to scientific data 
and that data will be recovered in manner consistent with 
the Secretary of the Interior
s standards and guidelines. 
The revised regulations would essentially continue this 
exception, but as a Conditional No Adverse Effect Agreement. 
The regulations further clarify that such treatment is not 
available if there is the potential for human remains to be 
affected or traditional cultural values are present. Should 
this approach be pursued or should undertakings that 
threaten to destroy archeological resources, regardless of 
the presence of human remains or traditional cultural 
values, be considered to have an adverse effect and 
processed according to Section 800.10? 



12. Coordination With the National Environmental Policy Act 



An identified shortcoming in the current Section 106 
regulations is the limited guidance provided for 
coordination between Section 106 reviews and those conducted 
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The 
revised regulations contain expanded provisions (Section 
800.19). Is the content sufficient? Are there specific 
areas that warrant more or less detail? Should similar 
guidance be provided for other related laws, such as Section 
4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act? 



13. Use of Information Technology 


The rapid advances in information technology and the 
widespread access of Federal agencies and other Section 106 
participants to it offers opportunities to improve Section 
106 case processing. Electronic filing of certain agency 
notices and determinations with the Council is one example. 
Are there specific places in the process where this kind of 
innovation should be encouraged? Do the regulations need to 
be modified to facilitate the use of contemporary 
information technology? Should formats for electronic 
submission of information be specified in the regulations or 
related guidance documents? 


IV. Impact Analysis 


A. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The proposed rules will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The 
Council's regulations, in their current and revised form, 
only impose obligations on Federal agencies. If a Federal 
agency is legally authorized and chooses to delegate its 
responsibility to local governments, then that Federal 
agency must determine whether or not its delegation will 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities. 


B. The Paperwork Reduction Act 


The proposed rules do not impose reporting requirements or 
the collection of information as defined in the Paperwork 
Reduction Act.

C. The National Environmental Policy Act 


Pursuant to 36 CFR Part 805, National Environmental Policy 
Act Implementation Procedures, the Council has determined 
that an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 


D. Executive Order 12866 


The Council is exempt from compliance with Executive Order 
12866 pursuant to a memorandum issued by the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs on October 12, 1993. 
Although the Council is exempt from compliance, the Council 
has complied with the principles set forth in the Order by 
identifying problems in our regulatory process and seeking 
to modify our regulations in order to establish a more 
efficient and practical regulatory framework. The Council 
has sought the views of the public, including State, local 
and tribal entities, through the use of focus group 
meetings, questionnaires and solicitation of informal 
advice. Furthermore, the Council has voluntarily submitted 
this regulation to the Office of Management and Budget for 
review in accordance with the Executive Order. 


E. Executive Order 12875 


The Council is exempt from compliance with the documentation 
requirements set forth in Executive Order 12875. However, 
the Council has adhered to the principles embodied in the 
Order. The proposed regulations, like the current 
regulations, do not mandate State, local and tribal 
governments to participate in the Section 106 process, but 
rather, mandate Federal agencies to inform and request the 
involvement of such sectors. The State, tribal or local 
governments have the option of declining to participate in 
the process. Thus, the regulations do not impose unfunded 
mandates. Moreover, the Historic Preservation Fund makes 
monies available to States that participate in the Section 
106 process. The Council's proposed regulations impose 
obligations on Federal agencies and do not delegate 
responsibilities to the States. If a Federal agency chooses 
to delegate its responsibilities, then the requirements of 
the Order must be addressed by that agency. State, local 
and tribal representatives have been an integral part of the 
development of the proposed rules as members of the 
Council's Regulations Task Force, as participants in focus 
groups, and as respondents to the Council's questionnaire. 
The proposed regulations provide a flexible process which 
includes various alternative procedures, including 
categorical exemptions, programmatic agreements and 
development of counterpart procedures to comply with the 
requirements of Section 106. 


F. Executive Order 12898 


The Council is not required to comply with this Order. 
Nevertheless, the regulations implementing Section 106 do 
not pose environmental risks, but rather, seek to avoid 
adverse effects on historic properties in all areas of the 
United States. 


G. Memorandum Concerning Government-to-Government Relations 
with Native American Tribal Governments 



The Council has fully complied with this Memorandum. A 
Native American representative serves as a member of the 
Council and as a member of the Council's Regulations Task 
Force. The proposed regulations enhance the opportunity for 
Native American involvement in the Section 106 process and 
clarify the obligation of Federal agencies to consult with 
Native Americans, fulfilling the objectives of the 1992 NHPA 
amendments.

470w. 


Subpart A_Background and Policy 


 800.1 

Purposes and participants. 



(a) 

Purposes of the Section 106 process.

 Section 106 
requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects 
of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the 
Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such 
undertakings. This part defines the manner in which Federal 
agencies meet both of these statutory responsibilities 
through the Section 106 process. The Section 106 process 
seeks to accommodate historic preservation concerns with the 
needs of Federal undertakings. It is designed to identify 
potential conflicts between the two and to resolve such 
conflicts through consultation among the Agency Official, 
the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Council, and 
other interested parties during the early stages of 
planning. By following the steps set forth in this part to 
assess the effects of an undertaking on historic properties 
and either resolving those effects through negotiated 
agreements or obtaining and considering the formal written 
comments of the Council membership, Federal agencies 
evidence that they have taken into account the effects of 
their undertakings on historic properties and have afforded 
the Council its reasonable opportunity to comment. 
(b) 

Consultation under this part.

 The fundamental principle 
of the Section 106 process is the identification and 
resolution of preservation issues in the planning of a 
Federal undertaking through an open and ongoing exchange of 
factual information and opinion between the Agency Official 
and those agencies, organizations, and individuals with an 
interest in the undertaking's effects on historic 
properties. This principle is embodied in the concept of 
consultation, which means the process of seeking, 
discussing, and considering in good faith the views of other 
participants in the Section 106 process. Section 
110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that agency procedures for 
compliance with Section 106 provide a process for the 
identification and evaluation of historic properties for 
listing in the National Register and the development and 
implementation of agreements, in consultation with State 
Historic Preservation Officers, local governments, Indian 
tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and the interested 
public, as appropriate, regarding the means by which adverse 
effects on such properties will be considered. The goal of 
the consultation process is to seek ways to avoid or 
minimize the adverse effects of an undertaking on historic 
properties. The agency should first seek ways to avoid the 
adverse effects of an undertaking, and where avoidance 
cannot reasonably or practicably be achieved, should seek 
ways to minimize those effects. Destruction of historic 
properties should always be a last resort. Consultation 
commences at the earliest stages of planning between the 
Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer 
and continues through the identification of historic 
properties, the assessment of the undertaking's effects and 
negotiation to resolve adverse effects, with the addition of 
other parties at various points and the ongoing opportunity 
for participation of the public. Consultation in the Section 
106 process normally results in agreed upon outcomes and 
decisions. In the event that there is disagreement, this 
part provides that the Council will resolve disputes over 
the application of these regulations and specific findings 
under them. In the event that consultation fails to result 
in resolution of an undertaking's adverse effects, the head 
of the agency retains final decisionmaking authority for the 
undertaking after obtaining and considering the formal 
written comments of the Council membership.

(c) 

Timing.

 Section 106 requires the Agency Official to 
complete the Section 106 process prior to the approval of 
the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or 
prior to the issuance of any license or permit. This does 
not bar an Agency Official from expending funds on, or 
authorizing, nondestructive project planning activities 
preparatory to an undertaking before complying with Section 
106, provided that such expenditures or activities do not 
restrict the consideration of alternatives to avoid or 
mitigate adverse effects on historic properties. The Agency 
Official shall ensure that the Section 106 process is 
initiated early in the planning stages of the undertaking, 
when the widest feasible range of alternatives is open for 
consideration. The Agency Official shall establish a 
schedule for completing the Section 106 process that is 
consistent with the planning schedule for the undertaking, 
the conduct of reviews required under other authorities (See 
 800.20), and the final approval of the undertaking. 
(d) 

Relation of the Section 106 process to agency 
preservation programs under Section 110.

 Section 110(a) of 
the Act requires a Federal agency to establish a 
preservation program for the identification, evaluation, and 
nomination of historic properties to the National Register 
and the protection of such properties. Agency procedures 
for compliance with Section 106 are a required element of 
such a program. Section 110 further requires that agency 
Section 106 procedures be consistent with this part. 
Subpart B of this part sets forth standards and procedures 
for determining consistency. The Council encourages 
agencies to develop their Section 110 procedures as soon as 
possible. Unless or until an agency has formally adopted 
its procedures and completed the process for substitution, 
including Council review ( 800.3(c)), this part governs the 
actions taken by an agency to take into account the effects 
of a proposed undertaking on historic properties and afford 
the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment in 
accordance with Section 106 of the Act. 
(e) 

Participants in the Section 106 process

._(1) 

Agency 
Official.

 The Agency Official with jurisdiction over an 
undertaking has legal responsibility for complying with 
Section 106. It is the Agency Official's responsibility to 
determine whether the agency's proposed action is an 
undertaking; establish an undertaking's area of potential 
effect; identify and evaluate potentially affected historic 
properties; assess an undertaking's likely effect upon them; 
seek and consider alternatives to avoid or reduce any 
adverse effects upon historic properties; decide upon an 
appropriate resolution of adverse effects; and afford the 
Council its comment opportunity. 
(i) 

Assistance by non-Federal parties.

 The Agency 
Official may use the services of grantees, 
applicants, consultants, or designees to prepare 
the necessary information and analyses, but 
remains legally responsible for Section 106 
compliance, including all determinations charged 
to the Agency Official under this part. If any 
document or study is prepared by a consultant or 
contractor for purposes of compliance with Section 
106 and this part, the Agency Official shall 
furnish guidance and shall independently evaluate 
the document prior to its approval, taking 
responsibility for its scope and contents. 
(ii) 

Multiple agencies involved in an undertaking.

 
If more than one Federal agency is involved in an 
undertaking, each agency has the responsibility 
for compliance with Section 106 and this part. 
The Council and the Federal agencies, in 
consultation with the Council, may mutually agree 
to designate a lead Federal agency. The lead 
Federal agency shall identify the appropriate 
official to serve as Agency Official for the 
purposes of this part. Assumption of lead agency 
status carries with it the responsibility to act 
on behalf of all participating Federal agencies 
during Section 106 review, addressing their 
collective responsibilities under Section 106 and 
this part. Designation of one agency as lead 
Federal agency does not abrogate the other Federal 
agencies' responsibilities to participate in the 
negotiation process if the Council deems it 
necessary, and to comply with the requirements of 
Section 106 and this part. 
(2) 

State Historic Preservation Officer.

 The State 
Historic Preservation Officer coordinates State 
participation in the implementation of the National 
Historic Preservation Act and is a key participant in 
the Section 106 process. The role of the State 
Historic Preservation Officer is to consult with and 
assist the Agency Official in identifying historic 
properties, assessing effects upon them, and 
considering and deciding upon the resolution of adverse 
effects. The State Historic Preservation Officer 
reflects the interests of the State and its citizens in 
the preservation of their cultural heritage and helps 
the Agency Official identify parties interested in an 
undertaking, effects upon historic properties, and 
alternatives that may avoid or reduce adverse effects 
upon historic properties. 
(3) 

Council.

 The Council is responsible for 
promulgating regulations to implement Section 106 in 
its entirety, consulting with and commenting to the 
Agency Official on an undertaking that affects historic 
properties, interpreting this part, and generally 
overseeing the operation of the Section 106 process. 
The Council may participate at any point in the Section 
106 process at its own initiative. 
(4) 

Interested parties.

 (i) Interested parties are 
those individuals and organizations that are identified 
by the Agency Official or who indicate to the Agency 
Official, the State Historic Preservation Officer or 
the Council in accordance with this part their concern 
with the effects of an undertaking on historic 
properties. If the State Historic Preservation Officer 
or the Council receive notification from interested 
parties, they shall notify the Agency Official. This 
part requires that particular interested parties be 
invited to participate in the Section 106 process under 
certain circumstances. In addition, whenever the 
Agency Official, the State Historic Preservation 
Officer, and the Council, if participating, agree that 
active participation of an interested party will 
advance the objectives of Section 106, they may invite 
that party to participate. Anyone who wishes to 
participate in the Section 106 process as an interested 
party should notify the Agency Official in writing and 
make the State Historic Preservation Officer and the 
Council aware of that request. 
(ii) Interested parties may include: 
(A) 

Local governments.

 Local governments are 
encouraged to take an active role in the Section 
106 process when undertakings affect historic 
properties within their jurisdiction. When a 
local government has legal responsibility for 
Section 106 compliance under programs such as the 
Community Development Block Grant Program, 
participation as the Agency Official is required. 
When no such legal responsibility exists, units of 
local government may request to participate in the 
Section 106 process. 
(B) 

Applicants for Federal assistance, permits, 
and licenses.

 When the undertaking is proposed by 
an applicant for Federal assistance or for a 
Federal permit or license, the applicant may 
participate in the Section 106 process in the 
manner prescribed in this part.

(C) 

Owners of affected properties.

 Individuals or 
organizations that own property that may be 
affected by an undertaking may request to 
participate. Qualifying property is not limited 
to historic property, but may include any real 
property affected directly or indirectly by the 
undertaking. 
(D) 

Other individuals and organizations

 that have 
notified the Agency Official of their concern 
about the effects of the undertaking on historic 
properties. 
(5) 

Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.

 (i) Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the Act requires the 
Agency Official to consult with any Indian tribe 
or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches 
religious and cultural significance to historic 
properties that may be affected by an undertaking. 
To meet this responsibility, the Agency Official, 
at the outset of the Section 106 process, shall 
identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations likely to have such interests and 
notify them of their opportunity to participate in 
the Section 106 process. The Agency Official 
shall provide for Indian tribe and Native Hawaiian 
participation in accordance with guidance issued 
by the National Park Service and the following 
principles: 
(A) Consultation shall be designed to 
identify the Indian tribe's or Native 
Hawaiian organization's general concerns and 
interests regarding historic properties, and 
to seek their assistance in identifying 
historic properties and assessing effects on 
such properties. The Agency Official shall 
commence consultation through the Indian 
tribe's or Native Hawaiian organization's 
governing body and also include traditional 
cultural authorities and members of 
traditional communities where appropriate. 
(B) To the extent feasible, consultation 
shall be initiated prior to any other public 
involvement procedures, in order to identify 
and resolve possible concerns about the 
confidentiality of information on historic 
properties. If the Indian tribe or the 
Native Hawaiian organization requests 
confidentiality, the Agency Official shall 
use the authority of Section 304 of the Act 
to protect the confidentiality of information 
about historic properties. 
(C) Consultation shall be carried out in a 
manner that respects the cultural values, 
modes of communication, and systems of 
interaction used by the Indian tribe or 
Native Hawaiian organization. The Agency 
Official shall be sensitive both in choosing 
a culturally appropriate manner of 
communication and in timing a request for 
views from Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations. The Agency Official shall 
initiate efforts to obtain such views early 
enough in the planning process, if necessary 
prior to other public involvement, to allow 
adequate time for responses and discussion of 
relevant preservation and traditional 
cultural issues. 
(D) Consultation shall include an Indian 
tribe that does not reside in the vicinity of 
the undertaking when the Indian tribe has an 
interest in historic properties affected by 
the undertaking and has notified the Agency 
Official of that interest. 
(ii) When an Indian tribe has assumed the 
functions of a State Historic Preservation Officer 
in the Section 106 process with respect to tribal 
lands under Section 101(d)(2)(C) of the Act, the 
Agency Official shall consult with the Indian 
tribe in accordance with the plan prepared by the 
tribe pursuant to that section. The Agency 
Official need not consult with the State Historic 
Preservation Officer except:

(A) To the extent such consultation is 
stipulated in the plan pursuant to Section 
101(d)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act; 
(B) With regard to effects on historic 
properties located on non-tribal lands; or 
(C) When the State Historic Preservation 
Officer requests to participate in 
consultation as an interested party. 
(6) 

The public.

 The Council values the views of the 
public on historic preservation questions and 
encourages maximum public participation in the Section 
106 process. This part defines specific points in the 
process where the Agency Official is required to 
provide the public with information concerning an 
undertaking and its effects on historic properties and 
to provide opportunities for public comment and input. 
The public may also provide its views at other points 
in the process and the Agency Official should consider 
those views in decisionmaking. This part also 
identifies specific opportunities for the public to 
seek Council review of an Agency Official's findings 
under this part. Members of the public should become 
familiar with these points for involvement in order to 
maximize their participation in the Section 106 
process. The Agency Official's efforts to seek and 
consider the views of the public shall reflect the 
nature and complexity of the undertaking and its 
effects on historic properties. 
(i) The public may provide its views to the 
Agency Official, the State Historic Preservation 
Officer, the Council, and interested parties 
during the determination of the area of potential 
effects ( 800.8(a)(1)), the assessment of the need 
for specific actions to identify historic 
properties ( 800.8 (b)), the evaluation of 
historic significance ( 800.8(c)), the assessment 
of effects ( 800.9(a)), the resolution of adverse 
effects ( 800.10), and the preparation of Council 
comments ( 800.11(b)). The relevant sections of 
this part provide details on how the public 
participates. 
(ii) The public may examine findings made by an 
Agency Official during the Section 106 process 
along with the documentation supporting such 
findings and responses provided by the State 
Historic Preservation Officer or the Council. 
These include the Agency Official's decision 
regarding whether an action is an undertaking 
( 800.7(a)), the Agency Official's finding as to 
the area of potential effects ( 800.8(a)(1)), the 
Agency Official's evaluation of a property's 
historic significance ( 800.8(c)), the Agency 
Official's finding regarding the presence of 
historic properties ( 800.8(d)), the Agency 
Official's finding regarding the undertaking's 
effect on historic properties ( 800.9), and any 
Memorandum of Agreement executed to resolve 
adverse effects ( 800.10(c)). Any member of the 
public may request the Council to review any of 
the preceding findings. 
(iii) Members of the public may request to 
participate in the Section 106 process as 
interested parties in accordance with  
800.1(e)(4)(iv). The request should be made early 
in the Section 106 process and in writing to the 
Agency Official. Copies of the request should be 
provided to the appropriate State Historic 
Preservation Officer and the Council. 
(iv) When issuing notice to the public in 
accordance with this part, an Agency Official 
shall adequately inform the public of historic 
preservation issues in order to elicit public 
views on such issues that can then be considered 
and resolved in decisionmaking. The Agency 
Official shall determine appropriate channels for 
providing notice, considering the nature of the 
affected public and culturally appropriate 
communication. 
(v) Agencies should use their 
established public participation 
procedures when they meet the public 
involvement requirements set forth in 
this part.

Subpart B_Federal Procedures to Implement Section 106 



 800.3 

Qualifying procedures. 



(a) 

Purpose. 

Section 110(a)(2) of the Act directs each 
Federal agency to establish a preservation program for the 
identification of historic properties, their evaluation and 
nomination to the National Register, and their protection. 
Section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that each Federal 
agency preservation program ensures that the agency's 
procedures for compliance with Section 106 are consistent 
with the Council's regulations; provides a process for the 
identification and evaluation of historic properties for 
listing in the National Register and for developing and 
implementing of agreements, in consultation with State 
Historic Preservation Officers, local governments, Indian 
tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and the interested 
public, as appropriate, regarding the means by which adverse 
effects on such properties will be considered; and provides 
for the disposition of Native American cultural items from 
Federal or tribal land in a manner consistent with Section 
3(c) of the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001-3013). This subpart sets 
forth standards for making agency procedures consistent with 
the Council's regulations and establishes the process by 
which the Council will evaluate such procedures. This 
subpart sets forth standards for evaluating 

(b) 

Definition of procedure. 

For the purposes of this 
subpart, any formal statement of agency policy or process 
that deals with the implementation of Section 106 shall be 
considered a procedure. Included are formal regulations and 
other procedures that are agency-wide in scope or pertain to 
a specific program, organizational unit, or geographical 
area. 

(c) 

Substitution of agency procedures for Council 
regulations. 

An agency procedure may substitute for the 
Council's regulations or any part thereof if it is formally 
approved by the Council membership as a counterpart 
procedure or executed through a Programmatic Agreement in 
accordance with  800.5. Agency procedures to augment, 
explain, or an agency without Council membership approval, 
but the Council membership reserves the right to determine 
that such a procedure, or any part thereof, is inconsistent 
with the Council's regulations. If an agency develops a 
procedure that is not proposed as a counterpart procedure, 
the agency may follow such procedure to adapt the specific 
requirements of Subpart C of this part to its programs, 
provided that the agency's procedure is consistent with the 
Council's regulations. Agency procedures found by the 
Council membership to be inconsistent with the Council's 
regulations are invalid for compliance with Section 106 of 
the Act to the extent that they are found inconsistent. 



 800.4 

Standards for evaluating consistency. 



(a) 

Consistency with the Council's regulations. 

The Council 
membership will consider agency procedures to be consistent 
with the Council's regulations for Section 106 when the 
agency procedures include the following provisions: 

(1) Initiation of the Section 106 process early in the 
planning and development of the agency's undertakings, 
coordinated with specific reference to the particular 
requirements of each agency program, so that 
identification and evaluation of historic properties, 
assessment of effects, and resolution of adverse 
effects occurs before irreversible commitments are made 
to preferred alternatives that limit the consideration 
of options which can avoid or reduce such effects; 


(2) Use of threshold terms, such as ``undertaking'' and 
``area of potential effects,'' that conform to the 
definitions and standards set forth in the Council's 
regulations;

(3) Provision for timely and informed consultation 
involving State Historic Preservation Officers, the 
Council, and interested parties in the identification 
and evaluation of historic properties, assessment of 
effects, and resolution of adverse effects; 

(4) Adequate opportunity for State Historic 
Preservation Officers, the Council, interested parties, 
and the public to obtain information on proposed 
undertakings and to make their views known to Agency 
Officials so that those views can be effectively 
considered in the planning of undertakings; 

(5) Access to and use of appropriate professional 
expertise at each step of the Section 106 process, 
consistent with standards and guidelines promulgated by 
the Secretary under Section 112 of the Act; 

(6) Integration of planning and decisionmaking with 
normal agency administrative processes and other 
government-wide requirements to the maximum extent 
possible, including provisions for considering the 
needs of State, local, and tribal environmental and 
historic preservation laws and regulations, with 
appropriate timing of decision points and actions; 

(7) Identification of appropriate officers of the 
agency to fulfill the duties of the Agency Official in 
the Section 106 process and proper delineation and 
communication of the roles and responsibilities of 
applicants, grantees, and permittees; 
(8) Use of culturally appropriate means of 
communication with Native American and Native Hawaiian 
communities and individuals, with sensitivity to the 
confidentiality of information related to historic 
properties significant to those parties; 
(9) A review and reporting system for Section 106 
compliance that is integrated into established internal 
agency environmental audit systems to ensure adequate 
quality control and promote procedural efficiency; 
(10) Provision for adequate safeguards against 
foreclosure and anticipatory demolition; 
(11) Use of procedures that place no greater burden of 
consultation, coordination, or record keeping on State 
Historic Preservation Officers, Indian tribes, and 
Native Hawaiian organizations and interested parties 
than this part; 

(12) Mechanisms to ensure that agency staff, 
cooperating agencies and organizations, contractors, 
applicants, permit holders, 
and others are trained in the 
use of the procedures; and 
(13) Provision for State Historic Preservation 
Officers, Indian Tribes, and Native Hawaiian 
organizations, and potentially interested parties to be 
notified of the procedures and kept informed about 
their implementation. 
(b) 

Consistency with Section 3(c) of Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act. 

The Council membership 
will consider agency procedures for compliance with Section 
106 to also meet the requirement that they provide for 
disposition of Native American cultural items in a manner 
consistent with Section 3(c) of the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act when the agency procedures 
include the following provisions: 
(1) A policy encouraging coordination between actions 
taken subject to Section 106 and the Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act compliance; 
(2) Early consultation with appropriate Indian tribes 
or Native Hawaiian organizations when planning 
undertakings subject to Section 106 on Federal or 
tribal lands, which may result in the intentional 
excavation and removal of Native American cultural 
items subject to the Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act; 
(3) Mechanisms to obtain and evidence the consent of 
the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization to the intentional excavation and removal 
of such items from tribal lands when proposed as part 
of an undertaking or as a mitigation measure pursuant 
to Section 106; and 
(4) Mechanisms to ensure appropriate disposition of any 
such items intentionally excavated and removed from 
Federal or tribal lands consistent with the ownership 
and right of control provisions in Sections 3(a) and 
3(b) of the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act. 


 800.5 

Counterpart procedures, programmatic agreements and 
exempted categories. 



(a) 

Counterpart procedures. 

An agency, in consultation with 
the Council, may develop counterpart procedures to 
substitute for all of Subpart C of this part. To qualify as 
counterpart procedures the Council must determine that the 
procedures are consistent with the Council's regulations in 
accordance with  800.4 and approve the procedures prior to 
publication in the 

Federal Register

. Counterpart procedures 
substitute for the Council's regulations for the purposes of 
the agency's compliance with Section 106, except that where 
an Indian tribe has entered into an agreement with the 
Council pursuant to  800.17, the agency shall follow tribal 
historic preservation regulations in lieu of the agency's 
procedures.

Agreement shall result in specific internal agency 
procedures that shall be issued in accordance with the 
agency's procedures and policies. 

(4) Compliance with the procedures established by an 
approved Programmatic Agreement satisfies the agency's 
Section 106 responsibilities for all individual 
undertakings covered by the agreement until it expires 
or is terminated. 

(5) The Agency Official shall publish notice of an 
approved Programmatic Agreement in the 

Federal Register

 
and make the agency procedures implementing the 
Programmatic Agreement readily available to the 
Council, State Historic Preservation Officers, and the 
public. 

(6) If the Council determines that the terms of a 
Programmatic Agreement are not carried out, or if such 
an agreement is terminated, the Agency Official shall 
comply with Subpart C of this part with regard to 
individual undertakings covered by the agreement. 

(c) 

Exempted categories

_(1) 

Criteria for establishing.


 When an agency has in place a preservation program meeting 
the requirements of Section 110(a) of the Act, or when an 
agency is developing a procedure to implement Section 106 in 
accordance with this subpart, an Agency Official may propose 
a category of agency undertakings that may be exempted from 
review under the provisions of this part, if the category 
meets all of the following criteria: 

(i) The action would otherwise qualify as an 
undertaking in accordance with  800.2(dd); 

(ii) The potential effects of the undertakings 
within the category upon historic properties are 
foreseeable and do not by their nature have the 
potential to result in changes to the character or 
use of historic properties; 

(iii) The agency's procedures establish the 
category of undertakings as a categorical 
exclusion under the National Environmental Policy 
Act, if applicable, consistent with the provisions 
of 40 CFR 1508.4; 

(iv) The agency's procedures provide that the exempted category will not be applicable if the Agency Official, the
SHPO, the Tribal Preservation Officer, if participating, or the Council determines that the normally 
exempted excluded undertaking may have an adverse effect. 

(2) 

Council review of proposed exempted categories. 

The Council membership shall review a request for an exemption that is supported by documentation demonstrating
that the criteria of  800.5(c)(1) have 
been met. Unless further information is requested by the Council, it shall approve or reject the proposed exemption
within 30 days of its submission. If the Council fails to respond within 30 days of a request for an exemption which is
supported by adequate documentation, then the requested exemption becomes 
effective.

Subpart C_The Section 106 Process 



 800.7 

Initiation of the section 106 process. 



The procedure in this subpart guides Agency Officials, State 
Historic Preservation Officers, and the Council in the 
conduct of the Section 106 process. Alternative methods of 
meeting Section 106 obligations are found in Subpart B of 
this part, ``Federal Procedures to Implement Section 106,'' 
and Subpart D of this part, ``Alternative Procedures.'' These 
include Counterpart Procedures, Programmatic Agreements, and 
Exempted Categories ( 800.5) and Tribal Program 
Alternatives ( 800.17). 

(a) 

Establish undertaking. 

In accordance with the 
definition set forth in  800.2(dd) and with consideration 
for any categorical exclusions previously established 
pursuant to  800.11, the Agency Official shall decide 
whether an undertaking exists for the purposes of Section 
106. If anyone disagrees with the Agency Official's 
decision and notifies the Council, the Council shall review 
the decision in accordance with  800.12(a).

(b) 

Coordinate with other reviews. 

The Agency Official 
shall establish a schedule for carrying out the steps of the 
Section 106 process that considers the overall planning and 
approval schedule for the undertaking and effective 
coordination with reviews required under other authorities 
including, but not limited to, the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 
the Archeological Resources Protection Act and agency 
specific legislation, such as Section 4(f) of the Department 
of Transportation Act. Further information regarding 
coordination of the Section 106 process with those 
authorities is found in Subpart E of this part. 

(c) 

Plan for public participation. 

The Agency Official 
shall commence planning for informing and involving the 
public in the conduct of the specific steps of the Section 
106 process. The Agency Official should seek to identify 
parties who may be concerned about the effects on historic 
properties, and to determine the issues that may be involved 
in dealing with such properties. The Agency Official should 
consider the likely complexity of preservation issues and 
the possible extent of public controversy, the nature of the 
potential effects of the undertaking upon historic 
properties, the suitability of using established public 
involvement procedures used by the agency to comply with the 
National Environmental Policy Act and related authorities, 
and the overall planning and approval schedule for the 
undertaking. Where an Agency Official determines that it is 
appropriate, or the State Historic Preservation Officer or 
the Council so request, the Agency Official shall establish 
a specific plan for public involvement and make it available 
to the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Council, 
interested parties, and the public at large. The Agency 
Official must reconsider the needs for public participation 
as the Section 106 process proceeds. 

(d) 

Initiate consultation with the State Historic 
Preservation Officer. 

The Agency Official shall determine 
the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer or 
Officers to be involved in the Section 106 process and 
proceed to consult in accordance with   800.8-800.10. 

(1) If the State Historic Preservation Officer declines 
in writing to participate in the Section 106 process, 
the Agency Official shall consult with the Council, 
without the State Historic Preservation Officer, to 
complete the Section 106 process. 

(2) If the State Historic Preservation Officer does not 
respond within 30 days of receipt to a written request 
for participation at any step in  800.8, the Agency 
Official may assume that the State Historic 
Preservation Officer concurs in the Agency Official's 
finding. The Agency Official may consult with the 
Council to complete the Section 106 process, in lieu of 
further efforts to obtain a response from the State 
Historic Preservation Officer. 

(3) If the State Historic Preservation Officer does not 
respond within 30 days of receipt to a written request 
for participation at any step in   800.9 or 800.10, 
the Agency Official may not assume such action to 
indicate the concurrence of the State Historic 
Preservation Officer with the Agency Official's 
position. The Agency Official may consult with the 
Council to complete the Section 106 process, in lieu of 
further efforts to obtain a response from the State 
Historic Preservation Officer. 

(e) 

Identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations. 

As early as possible in planning the 
undertaking, the Agency Official shall initiate consultation 
with any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that 
the Agency Official has reason to believe might attach 
religious and cultural significance to historic properties 
in the area of potential effects, or cause such contact to 
be initiated by an applicant for Federal assistance or 
permission. Such consultation should be designed to 
identify the tribe's or organization's general concerns and 
interests regarding historic properties, and to seek the 
tribe's or organization's assistance in identifying historic 
properties and assessing effects on such properties. 
Consultation should be carried out in a manner consistent 
with  800.1(e)(5) and continue in the same manner when 
identifying historic properties, assessing effects, and 
resolving adverse effects.

 800.8 

Identification of historic properties. 



(a) 

Determine scope of identification efforts. 

At the earliest feasible stage in planning any undertaking, coordinated with the preparation of any Environmental
Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, and in consultation
with the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Agency Official shall: 

(1) Define the area of potential effects, using the definition set forth in  800.2(f); 

(2) Review existing information on historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking, including any
data concerning the likelihood that unidentified historic properties exist in the area of potential effects; and


(3) Seek information from local governments, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, traditional cultural
authorities, other organizations, and interested parties likely to have knowledge of, or concerns with, historic
properties in the area and should seek to identify the issues that may be involved in dealing with historic properties
in the planning process. 

(b) 

Locate historic properties. 

Based on the information gathered under  800.8(a) and the State Historic Preservation Officer's opinion on
further actions to identify historic properties that may be affected, the Agency Official shall determine the need
for further actions, such as field surveys, modeling, informant interviews and ethnographic studies, to identify
historic properties. The Agency Official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties
that may be affected by the undertaking and gather sufficient information to evaluate the eligibility of these properties
for the National Register. Efforts to identify historic properties shall follow applicable standards and guidelines
established by the Secretary and conform to the agency's program to meet the requirements of Section 110(a)(2) of
the Act. 

(c) 

Evaluate historic significance.

_(1) 

Apply National Register Criteria. 

In consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer and following the Secretary's Standards and Guidelines
for Evaluation, the Agency Official shall apply the National Register Criteria to properties that may be affected
by the undertaking and that have not been previously evaluated for National Register eligibility. The passage of
time, changing perceptions of significance, or incomplete prior evaluations may require reevaluation of properties
previously determined eligible or ineligible. 

(2) 

Agree that a property is eligible. 

If the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree that a property is eligible under the criteria,
the property shall be considered eligible for the National Register for Section 106 purposes. 

(3) 

Agree that a property is not eligible. 

If the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer agree that the criteria are not met, the property
shall be considered not eligible for the National Register for Section 106 purposes, subject to any appeal or petition
under 36 CFR part 60. 

(4) 

Resolve questions on eligibility. 

If the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer do not agree, or if the Council or the Secretary
so request, the Agency Official shall obtain a determination of eligibility from the Secretary pursuant to the applicable
National Park Service regulations. 

(d) 

Results of identification and evaluation.

_(1) 

No historic properties found. 

If the Agency Official determines in accordance with  800.8 (a) through (c) that there are no historic properties
within the area of potential effects, the Agency Official shall provide documentation of this finding as set forth
in  800.14(a) to the State Historic Preservation Officer. The Agency Official shall notify known interested
parties and make the documentation available for public inspection. Unless the Council determines otherwise in
accordance with  800.12(a), the Agency Official has completed the Section 106 process. 

(2) 

Historic properties found. 

If there are historic properties that the undertaking may affect, the Agency Official shall notify known interested
parties and assess effects in accordance with  800.9. 

(e) 

Council review of agency findings. 

If anyone disagrees with the Agency Official's finding regarding the presence of historic properties, including
the determination of the area of potential effects, the Agency Official's efforts to locate historic properties,
or the evaluation of historic significance, and notifies the Council, the Council shall review the finding in accordance
with  800.12(a). The Council shall refer questions relating to National Register eligibility to the Secretary
for resolution and the Agency Official shall provide relevant documentation to assist the Secretary's review. 



 800.9 

Assessment of effects. 


(a) 

Apply criteria of adverse effect. 

In consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Agency Official shall apply the criteria of adverse
effect set forth at  
800.9(a)(1) to historic properties within the area of potential effects, giving consideration to the views concerning
such effects provided by interested parties and the public, if any. The Agency Official shall also consult with any
Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to historic properties
within the area of potential effects.

An undertaking is considered to have an adverse effect when it may alter characteristics of a historic property that
may qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that may diminish the integrity of the property's
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Adverse effects may be direct or indirect.
Direct effects are caused by the undertaking and occur at the same time and place. Indirect effects include those caused
by the undertaking that are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. For
the purpose of determining adverse effect, alteration to features of a property's location, setting, or use may be
relevant, depending on the property's significant characteristics, and should be considered. 

(2) 

Examples of adverse effects. 

Adverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to: 

(i) Physical destruction, damage, or alteration of all or part of the property; 
(ii) Isolation of the property, from or alteration of, the character of the property's setting when that character
contributes to the property's qualification for the National Register; 

(iii) Introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property or alter
its setting; 

(iv) Neglect of a property which may result in its deterioration or destruction; and 

(v) Transfer, lease, or sale of property under the jurisdiction or control of a Federal agency. 

(b) 

Request State Historic Preservation Officer concurrence.

 If the Agency Official believes the effect will not be adverse or proposes to carry out the undertaking in accordance
with a Conditional No Adverse Effect Agreement that meets the requirements of  800.9(b)(2), the Agency Official
shall submit the proposed finding or agreement with adequate documentation to the State Historic Preservation Officer
for review and concurrence. 

(1) 

State Historic Preservation Officer response to a submitted finding of no adverse effect.

 (i) If the State Historic Preservation Officer concurs with the Agency Official's finding, the Agency Official may
proceed and shall carry out the undertaking in accordance with  800.9(c)(1).

terms for such agreement, the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer may execute a Conditional
No Adverse Effect Agreement that meets the criteria of  800.9(b)(2)(i). 

(i) A Conditional No Adverse Effect Agreement may be executed when:

that conform to the Secretary's ``Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings''
and that have been reviewed by the State Historic Preservation Officer prior to implementation; or 

(C) The undertaking is limited to the transfer, lease, or sale of a historic property, and adequate restrictions or

participate, the Agency Official shall negotiate 
with the State Historic Preservation Officer and 
interested parties to seek ways to avoid or reduce 
the adverse effects by negotiating acceptable

objects to the Memorandum of Agreement before this 
review period ends, the Memorandum of Agreement

Preparation. 

The Council 
shall prepare its comments with an adequate opportunity for 
the Agency Official, the State Historic Preservation 
Officer, interested parties, and the public to provide their 
views on the adverse effects of the undertaking and offer 
any alternatives or modifications to resolve those effects. 
The Agency Official shall make a good faith effort to 
provide additional information available concerning the 
undertaking, its effects, and possible alternatives or 
modifications, and shall assist the Council in arranging an 
onsite inspection and an opportunity for public 
participation when requested by the Council. The Agency 
Official shall assist the Council to ensure that any Indian 
tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is afforded a 
reasonable opportunity to make its views known during the

(a) 

Review of Agency Official findings_

(1) 

Timeliness. 


The Council shall consider a request for review of an Agency 
Official's finding under this part at any time, regardless 
of the status of the undertaking in the planning and 
approval process. The Council may determine that a request 
for review is not timely and decline to consider the 
substance of the request. The Council shall deem a request 
for review timely if it determines that an opportunity 
exists to influence the effects of an undertaking on 
historic properties, provided that such a determination 
shall not preclude the Council from subsequently determining 
that an agency has foreclosed the Council's opportunity to 
comment pursuant to  800.12(b). 

(2) 

Council review. 

The Council shall review the 
substance of a request for review and provide its 
conclusions to the Agency Official, the State Historic 
Preservation Officer, and the requesting party within 
30 days. The Council shall reach a determination on 
the finding that is presented for review and may also 
advise the Agency Official of appropriate steps to take 
in light of the Council's determination. 

(3) 

Agency Official responsibilities. 

The Agency 
Official shall take all measures to avoid adverse 
effects to historic properties while the Council is 
reviewing the finding. The Agency Official is not 
required to delay approval of the undertaking prior to 
a request for review being filed or during the 
Council's review of such request, but should recognize 
that a Council determination may require the Agency 
Official to reconsider actions previously taken in the 
Section 106 process. In response to the Council's 
determination, the Agency Official shall take the 
appropriate steps specified in this part.

(5) 

Effect of the Council's determination. 

In 
accordance with Section 211 of the Act, the Council's 
determination on the finding shall be conclusive for 
the purposes of Section 106 and this part. 

(b) 

Foreclosure of the Council's opportunity to comment._

(1) 

Notice to Agency Official. 

The Council membership 
may inform the head of an agency that an Agency 
Official has taken an action that has precluded the 
Agency Official from completing the requirements of 
Section 106 in accordance with this part and thereby 
foreclosed the Council's opportunity to comment. The 
Council shall notify the Agency Official that it is 
considering a finding of foreclosure and afford the 
Agency Official 30 days to provide information for the 
Council's consideration as to whether the agency has 
foreclosed the Council's opportunity to comment. 

(2) 

Consideration of foreclosure. 

After providing 
notice to the Agency Official, the Council membership 
shall make a final determination as to foreclosure. If 
the Council membership determines that the Agency 
Official has foreclosed the Council's opportunity to 
comment, the Council shall transmit its determination 
to the head of the agency as a Notice of Violation. 

(c) 

Anticipatory demolition. 

Section 110(k) of the Act 
specifies that an agency shall not grant a loan, loan 
guarantee, permit, license, or other assistance to an 
applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of 
Section 106, has intentionally significantly adversely 
affected a historic property to which the grant would 
relate, or to an applicant who allowed such significant 
adverse effect to occur and had the legal power to prevent 
its occurrence. If, after consultation with the Council, 
the agency determines that circumstances justify granting 
such assistance, despite the adverse effect created or 
permitted by the applicant, the agency may allow the grant. 

(1) 

Information for the Council. 

If the Council is 
apprised of or has reason to believe that anticipatory 
demolition has occurred, it shall request information 
from the Agency Official regarding the applicant's 
action, including, but not limited to: 

(i) The actual effect on historic properties, 
evaluated in the context of the Criteria of 
Adverse Effect set forth in  800.9(a)(1); 

(ii) Any actions, if any, taken by the Agency 
Official with respect to the applicant, the 
undertaking, or the historic properties; 

(iii) Any notification given to the applicant 
regarding the Section 106 process and any other 
information relating to the applicant's knowledge 
of the requirements of Section 106 and this part; 

(iv) The degree of control of the applicant over 
the action causing adverse effects; 

(v) Any other information bearing on the 
applicant's intent regarding the action causing 
the adverse effects; and

Preservation Officer and any interested parties. 

(2) 

Council views on anticipatory demolition. 

Based on 
the information provided by the Agency Official and any 
other information provided to the Council, the Council 
shall advise the Agency Official of its views regarding 
whether the applicant has engaged in anticipatory 
demolition. 

(3) 

Agency determination. 

The Agency Official shall 
consider the views of the Council in reaching its 
determination regarding anticipatory demolition. The 
Agency Official may independently determine that 
anticipatory demolition has occurred, without seeking 
the views of the Council. 

(4) 

Denial of assistance. 

If the Agency Official 
determines that anticipatory demolition has occurred, 
the Agency Official shall not grant a loan, loan 
guarantee, permit, license, or other assistance to the 
applicant, unless after consultation with the Council, 
the Agency Official determines that circumstances 
justify granting such assistance despite the adverse 
effect created or permitted by the applicant. In that 
case, the Agency Official may grant the assistance. 

(5) 

Consideration of circumstances justifying granting 
assistance. 

When consulting with the Council regarding 
circumstances that would justify granting the 
assistance, the Agency Official shall provide the 
Council with: 

(i) The basis for its determination that 
anticipatory demolition had occurred; 

(ii) The Agency Official's assessment of the 
severity of the damage to historic properties, the 
significance of the historic properties, the 
opportunities for mitigation, and the availability 
of other remedial actions;

and 
(iv) Any views or information provided to the Agency Official by the applicant. 
(6) 

Agency determination regarding justifying circumstances. 

The Council shall provide the Agency Official with its written views regarding justifying circumstances. If, after
consulting with the Council, the Agency Official determines that circumstances justify granting the assistance,
despite the adverse effect, the Agency Official shall notify the Council, the State Historic Preservation Officer
and interested parties of its decision and provide documentation on the basis of its finding. 
(7) 

Review of undertaking. 

If the Agency Official decides to grant the assistance, the Agency Official shall complete the Section 106 process
for the undertaking in accordance with   800.7 through 800.11. 
(d) 

Notice of Violation.

_(1) 

Basis for notice. 

If the Council membership determines that the actions of an Agency Official constitute a violation of Section 106
of the Act or this part, the Council may issue a Notice of Violation to the Agency Official and the head of the agency advising
that the agency has failed to meet the requirements of Federal law. The Council membership may determine that a violation
of Section 106 has 
occurred under the following circumstances: 

(i) An Agency Official has proceeded with the planning and approval of an undertaking without adequate compliance
with Section 106 of the Act and this part; 

(ii) An Agency Official or an applicant has failed to carry out the terms of a no adverse effect determination, a Conditional
No Adverse Effect Agreement, a Memorandum of Agreement, a Programmatic Agreement, or a counterpart regulation,
or failed to comply with a process or requirement originating under such document; 


(iii) An Agency Official has taken or sanctioned an action that has resulted in adverse effects to a historic property,
including demolition by 
neglect, prior to completion of the Section 106 process; or 
(iv) An Agency Official has foreclosed the Council's opportunity to comment.

Procedure. 

The Council shall issue a preliminary 
Notice of Violation to an Agency Official when it 
believes that a violation of Section 106 or this part 
has occurred or is about to occur. The preliminary 
Notice of Violation shall apprise the Agency Official 
of the basis for the Council's action and request the 
views of the Agency Official on the issue. The Council 
membership may, at its discretion, decide to issue a 
final Notice of Violation to the Agency Official. The 
final Notice of Violation shall indicate the specific 
reasons for the Council membership's finding and shall 
also be provided to the head of the agency. 
(3) 

Effect. 

A Notice of Violation issued by the 
Council constitutes the opinion of the Council 
membership that an Agency Official has acted in 
violation of Section 106 of the Act and this part. 
(e) 

Reporting._

(1) 

Reports of agency performance. 

The Council may 
review the performance of agencies and other parties

Justice, and the Congress, as it deems appropriate. 
(2) 

Remedial actions. 

When the Council determines that 
an agency has failed to meet its Section 106 
obligations in a manner consistent with this part, the 
Council may notify the appropriate Agency Official that 
the Council will participate in specific steps of the 
Section 106 process for review of the agency's 
undertakings. 


 800.13 

Special requirements for protecting National 
Historic Landmarks. 


Section 110(f) of the Act requires that the Agency Official, 
to the maximum extent possible, undertake such planning and 
actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to any National

documentation is inadequate, the running of the time period 
specified at the relevant section of this part shall be 
suspended until adequate documentation is submitted. 


 800.15

Properties discovered after approval or during 
implementation of an undertaking. 



(a) 

Planning for discoveries. 

When the Agency Official's 
identification efforts in accordance with  800.8 indicate 
that historic properties are likely to be discovered during 
implementation of an undertaking, the Agency Official is 
encouraged to develop a plan for the resolution of any 
adverse effects upon such properties if discovered. The 
plan should be incorporated into any Memorandum of Agreement 
executed for the undertaking. 

(b) 

When properties are discovered_

(1) If a plan exists. When an Agency Official has 
completed the Section 106 process and prepared a plan 
in accordance with  800.15(a), the Agency Official 
shall satisfy the requirements of Section 106 
concerning properties discovered during implementation 
of an undertaking by following the plan. 
(2) 

If no plan exists. 

When an Agency Official has 
completed the Section 106 process without preparing a 
plan in accordance with  800.15(a) and finds after 
beginning to carry out the undertaking that the 
undertaking will have an adverse effect upon a 
previously unidentified historic property, or adversely 
affect a known historic property in an unanticipated 
manner, the Agency Official shall resolve the adverse 
effects by: 
(i) Consulting pursuant to  800.10; 
(ii) Consulting pursuant to  800.15(c); or

(iii) Complying with the Archeological and 
Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 469(a)-(c) 
and implementing regulations, instead of this 
part, if the property is principally of 
archeological significance and subject to the 
requirements of that Act. When the Agency 
Official elects to follow this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii), the Agency Official shall consult 
with the State Historic Preservation Officer on 
the actions proposed and provide the Council with 
a report on the actions after they are completed. 
(c) 

Expedited consultation. 

When an Agency Official elects 
to follow this paragraph (c), the Agency Official shall 
notify the State Historic Preservation Officer and the 
Council at the earliest possible time, describe the actions 
proposed to resolve the adverse effects, and request the 
views of the Council and the State Historic Preservation 
Officer on the proposed actions. The Council and the State 
Historic Preservation Officer shall provide an interim 
response to the Agency Official within 48 hours of the 
request and a final response to the Agency Official within 
30 days of the request. 

(d) 

Other considerations_

(1) 

Eligibility of properties. 


When a newly discovered property has not previously been 
included in or determined eligible for the National 
Register, the Agency Official may assume the property to be 
eligible for purposes of Section 106. 
(2) 

Discoveries on tribal or Federal land. 

When a 
discovery occurs and compliance with this section is 
necessary on tribal or Federal lands, the Agency 
Official shall consult with the Indian tribe or other 
appropriate parties during implementation of this 
section's requirements and comply with the Native 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act as 
required. 
(3) 

Agency responsibilities during resolution of issues 
involving newly discovered properties. 

Section 106 and 
this part do not require the Agency Official to stop 
work on the undertaking. Depending on the nature of 
the property and the undertaking's adverse effects on 
it, the Agency Official shall make reasonable efforts 
to avoid or minimize harm to the property until the 
requirements of this section are met. If the 
provisions of Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act are applicable, the Agency Official 
must comply with requirements of the Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and may be 
required to cease the activity in the area of the 
discovery. 


Subpart D_Alternative Procedures 


 800.16 

Federal agency program alternatives. 


(a) 

Counterpart procedures. 

An agency may develop 
counterpart procedures to substitute for Subpart B of this 
part. Sections 800.4 and 800.5(a) govern the development of 
counterpart procedures. 
(b) 

Programmatic Agreements. 

A Programmatic Agreement may 
be used to fulfill an agency's Section 106 responsibilities 
for certain activities or programs that would otherwise 
require numerous individual requests for comments. 
Programmatic Agreements for programs shall be developed in 
accordance with  800.5(b). 


 800.17 

Tribal program alternatives. 


(a) 

Application. 

An Indian tribe may enter into an 
agreement with the Council to substitute tribal historic 
preservation regulations for the Council's regulations for 
the review of undertakings on tribal lands. 
(b) 

Request for Council approval. 

An Indian tribe shall 
request the Council to approve the substitution of tribal 
historic preservation regulations. The request shall be 
accompanied by a copy of the tribal regulations, a list of 
potential interested parties and the Indian tribe's 
comparison of the consideration afforded historic properties 
under its regulations and the Council's regulations. 
(c) 

Consultation. 

The Council shall consult with the 
requesting Indian tribe, the appropriate State Historic 
Preservation Officer or Officers, the Secretary and any 
interested parties who so request. The requesting Indian 
tribe shall provide the information submitted in accordance 
with  800.17(b) to interested parties as determined by the 
Council. The Council shall provide notice to Federal 
agencies and consider any comments received. 
(d) 

Approval. 

If the Council determines that the tribal 
historic preservation regulations will afford historic 
properties consideration equivalent to that afforded by the 
Council's regulations, the Council shall execute an 
agreement with the requesting Indian tribe to that effect. 
(e) 

Effect. 

After an agreement is executed, an Agency 
Official with jurisdiction over an undertaking carried out 
on tribal lands covered by the agreement shall follow the 
approved tribal historic preservation regulations in lieu of 
the Council's regulations. 
(f) 

Amendment and termination. 

Either the Indian tribe or 
the Council may seek an amendment to the agreement, which 
shall take effect upon agreement of both parties. The 
agreement may be terminated at any time by the Indian tribe 
and by the Council after it finds that the operation of the 
tribal regulations do not afford historic properties 
consideration equivalent to the Council's regulations. 



 800.18 

Emergency situations.

<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Counterpart procedures. 

Prior to a disaster or 
emergency, the Agency Official should develop a plan for 
taking historic properties into account during operations 
which respond to a disaster or emergency declared by the 
President or Agency Official. At the request of the Agency 
Official, the Council will assist in the development of such 
a plan. The plan shall be submitted to the Council for 
approval and, if approved, shall govern the agency's 
historic preservation responsibilities during any disaster 
or emergency. 
(b) 

Alternatives to counterpart procedures. 

When an Agency 
Official proposes an emergency undertaking as an essential 
and immediate response to a disaster or emergency declared 
by the President, and the agency has not developed 
counterpart procedures pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Agency Official may satisfy Section 106 by: 
(1) Following a State Disaster Plan which contains a 
historic preservation component that has been 
approved by the Council; or 
(2) If there is no State Disaster Plan which contains 
a historic preservation component that has been 
approved by the Council and if the Agency Official 
determines that circumstances permit, notifying 
the Council and the appropriate State Historic 
Preservation Officer prior to the undertaking and 
affording them an opportunity to comment within 
seven days of notification. 
(c) 

Local governments statutorily delegated responsibility 
for Section 106 compliance. 

For the purposes of activities 
assisted under Title I of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1974, as amended, or any other statute 
which delegates Section 106 compliance responsibilities,   
800.18 (a) and (b) also apply to an imminent threat to public 
health or safety as a result of a natural disaster or 
emergency declared by a local government's chief executive 
officer or legislative body, provided that if the Council or 
State Historic Preservation Officer objects within 7 days, 
the Agency Official shall comply with   800.7 through 
800.10. 
(d) 

Applicability. 

Paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies 
only to undertakings that will be implemented within 30 days 
after the disaster or emergency has been initially and 
formally declared by the President. An agency may seek 
renewals of the 30 day period by requesting a renewal from 
the Council prior to the completion of the 30 days. 


Subpart E_Coordination With Other Authorities. 


 800.19 

Coordination with other authorities. 


(a) 

Purpose and scope. 

The requirements of Section 106 of 
the National Historic Preservation Act are independent of 
other environmental review and protection, historic 
preservation, and resource management authorities. As such, 
compliance with one does not substitute for compliance with 
the other. To promote program effectiveness and efficiency, 
Agency Officials are encouraged to coordinate and, where 
appropriate, integrate the requirements of Section 106 and 
this part with the requirements of other environmental 
review and protection, historic preservation, and resource 
management authorities to the maximum extent feasible. 
Neither Section 106 or this part require that Federal 
agencies comply with these related authorities, nor do they 
supersede any regulations that have been issued to govern 
any related authorities. 
(b) 

Related authorities. 

Authorities that should be 
considered for coordination with Section 106 compliance 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1) Other authorities that require agencies to 
identify, evaluate, and consider effects on historic 
properties through planning processes (e.g., National 
Environmental Policy Act; American Indian Religious 
Freedom Act; Federal Land Policy and Management Act; 
National Forest Management Act; and Department of 
Transportation Act, Section 4(f)); and 
(2) Other authorities that require agencies to 
establish mechanisms for protection and disposition of 
historic properties (e.g., Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act; Archeological 
Resources Protection Act; Abandoned Shipwrecks Act; and 
Archeological and Historic Preservation Act). 
(c) 

Coordination with specific authorities_


(1) 

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)._

The Agency 
Official should coordinate the identification, evaluation, 
assessment, and resolution of adverse effect steps of 
Subpart C of this part with NEPA requirements, so that 
determinations reached under the Section 106 process are 
accurately reflected in the Agency Official's decision- 
making process for the proposed undertaking. 
(i) During the preparation of preliminary 
environmental investigations and studies (and the 
scoping process where applicable), the Agency 
Official should ensure that information is 
explicitly sought on the presence of historic 
properties and the nature of any effects upon 
them. This information is sought to be consistent 
with the spirit of NEPA to identify, avoid, 
minimize, and lastly to mitigate unavoidable 
adverse environmental effects. 
(ii) The Agency Official is encouraged to 
coordinate the public participation requirements 
of the EIS process with those of the Section 106 
process to eliminate duplication and maximize 
public knowledge and understanding of the 
undertaking and its effects upon historic 
properties, provided that the use of the NEPA 
public participation process shall not abrogate 
the public involvement rights afforded in the 
Council's regulations. 
(iii) An undertaking considered to be 
categorically excluded from review under NEPA in 
accordance with agency procedures may require 
review under Section 106 (See  800.5(c)(3)). 
(iv) When the Agency Official prepares an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to meet 
NEPA requirements, the EA or DEIS should 
document the steps taken to comply with 
Section 106 and reflect the method by which 
the Agency Official concluded the Section 106 
process. 
(A) The Agency Official should complete the 
identification and evaluation of potentially 
affected historic properties and the 
assessment of effects on such properties as 
set forth in Subpart C of this part prior to 
circulating or making the EA or DEIS 
available for comment. The Agency Official 
may include the resolution of adverse 
effects, if that step has been completed 
prior to circulation of the Draft EIS.

<TEXT>
 

(B) The Agency Official should complete the 
Section 106 process for affected historic 
properties so that the revised EA or Final 
EIS will document the conclusion of the 
Section 106 process, including any no adverse 
effect determinations, Memoranda of Agreement 
or Council comments. 

(C) The Agency Official may use an EA or 
Draft EIS to meet the information 
requirements of Subpart C of this part, 
provided that the document contains the 
information specified in  800.14 as 
appropriate. 

(D) The Agency Official should ensure that 
the Finding of No Significant Impact or 
Record of Decision incorporates any 
applicable mitigation measures related to 
effects on historic properties. 

(v) Further guidance on coordination with NEPA is 
contained in Appendix A of this part. 

(2) 

American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA). 

An 
Agency Official planning or reviewing an undertaking 
which may affect Native Americans' exercise of their 
religion, including access to religious sites, should 
initiate consultation with such groups as early as 
possible in planning. Such consultation should be 
carried out in a manner that is sensitive to the 
cultural values of the concerned group, and may be 
combined with consultation under Section 106. Where 
the undertaking may affect historic properties that 
possess traditional religious and cultural importance, 
Subpart C of this part sets forth the process for 
consulting with Native Americans to meet the 
requirements of Section 106. 

(3) 

Federal Land Policy and Management Act and National 
Forest Management Act. 

Agencies planning or reviewing 
undertakings on Federal lands should integrate the 
public notification, identification, evaluation, 
assessment of effects and resolution of adverse effects 
under Section 106 with the land-use planning 
requirements of these authorities. 

(4) 

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act (NAGPRA). 

Agencies planning or reviewing 
undertakings on Federal or tribal lands which may 
result in the intentional removal or inadvertent 
discovery of Native American cultural items as defined 
in NAGPRA are encouraged to combine necessary 
consultation and agreement with Indian tribes and 
Native Hawaiian organizations with the provisions of 
Subpart C of this part. 

(5) 

Archeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA).

 
Agencies planning or reviewing undertakings on public 
or Indian lands which may involve excavation or removal 
of archeological resources subject to protection under 
ARPA should coordinate the permit application and 
permit review process with consultation under Section 
106. The information used for ARPA permit issuance may 
be used as documentation for review under Section 106. 
If the only Federal involvement is issuance of an ARPA 
permit, compliance with Section 106 is not required. 

(6) 

Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation 
Act. 

A Department of Transportation agency planning an 
undertaking that may require the 
use of a historic site is 
encouraged to integrate the 
activities required under this Part 
with activities that may be 
performed to support determinations 
under Section 4(f) of the 
Department of Transportation Act, 
with respect to such site. 



Appendix A to Part 800_Identifying Historic Properties in 
Coordination With Other Planning Needs




This Appendix offers guidance on implementing 36 CFR Part 800. 
It is designed to supplement and explain the regulations, but 
is not binding on Federal agencies. 

(a) 

Overall timing and coordination. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941003-1-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The Section 106 process should be used during the 
planning process to progressively narrow resource concerns and 
issues requiring resolution about historic properties and 
historic preservation. Ultimately, the objective is to 
resolve outstanding conflicts between proposed undertakings 
and their effects on historic properties, and to make 
available an appropriate level of information to 
decisionmakers so that they can ``take into account'' the 
effects of those undertakings on historic properties when the 
conflicts are not completely resolved. Consequently, the 
process will be most effective when planning, review, 
consultation, and decisionmaking steps are explicitly linked 
to the nature and scope of the undertaking as well as to other 
relevant planning and program requirements to the maximum 
extent possible. 

(2) The Agency Official should establish a procedure and 
schedule for completing the Section 106 process that is 
consistent with the planning approach and approval schedule 
for the undertaking. 

(3) The Agency Official should begin the Section 106 process 
and integrate it with other planning needs at the earliest 
possible time, when the widest feasible range of alternatives 
is open for consideration. The process should be fully 
coordinated with actions and preparation of documents 
necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) and other environmental and planning requirements. 
This will help to ensure that planning and decisions fully 
reflect historic preservation issues and cultural values and 
concerns, maximize program and budgetary efficiency, and head 
off potential conflicts later in the process that could lead 
to delays and litigation. 

(b) Early planning. 

At the earliest feasible stage in 
planning any undertaking, in conjunction with the preparation 
of any Environmental Assessment (EA) or Draft Environmental 
Impact Statement (DEIS) under the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA), and in consultation with the State Historic 
Preservation Officer where appropriate, the Agency Official 
should: 

(1) 

Establish the nature of the proposed undertaking. 

Does 
it deal principally with operation of a program with a variety 
of public policy objectives, management or maintenance of 
resources and resource types, or planning and approval of a 
specific project? What is the extent of public investment in 
the undertaking? Will the effects of the undertaking be 
widespread or localized? 

(2) 

Determine what decisions need to be made about the 
proposed undertaking, and who needs to make them. 

Does the 
Agency Official for a single agency have jurisdiction and 
control over the undertaking, or is that jurisdiction shared 
with other agencies? At what level will decisions be made 
within the agency? If there are other Federal agencies 
involved, who will be the lead Federal agency, and how will 
responsibilities be apportioned? Is all or part of the 
undertaking on tribal or State lands, and subject to other 
legal requirements?

<DOCNO> FR941003-1-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) 

Determine the range of likely historic preservation 
issues that may need to be considered. 

What is the extent of 
knowledge of historic properties that may be affected? Are 
effects likely to be detrimental or beneficial? Is public 
interest or controversy likely? What are the program and 
fiscal consequences of these issues in relation to the 
planning, approval, and implementation of the undertaking? 

(4) 

Decide what legal responsibilities, policy objectives, 
and performance standards need to be satisfied in the planning 
and execution of the proposed undertaking. 

What other 
statutory, policy, fiscal, or timing requirements apply that 
may affect consultation and decisions under Section 106? What 
legal or practical constraints may affect the planning and 
execution of the proposed undertaking, such as access for 
identification of historic properties? 

(5) 

Establish how to identify and consult with others who may 
have a legal responsibility or a likely interest in the 
proposed undertaking, and what those responsibilities or 
interests might be. 

To what extent should other branches within the lead Federal agency be 
consulted? Other Federal, State, or local government agencies and organizations? Can 
the State Historic Preservation Officer help identify other parties with an interest in or 
information about local historic preservation values and concerns? 

(6) 

Establish the area of potential effects of each alternative under consideration, 
including the likelihood of direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on historic properties.

 

(i) The area of potential effects: 

(A) should be broadly and prospectively defined, but with a logical 
linkage to reasonably foreseeable potential effects that various alternatives 
for the particular type of undertaking could have; 

(B) should consider possible direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the 
physical characteristics, contextual environment, use, or long-term 
preservation of properties that help qualify them for inclusion in the 
National Register, recognizing that: 

(I) direct effects are caused by the undertaking and occur at the 
same time and place; 

(II) indirect effects include those caused by the undertaking that
