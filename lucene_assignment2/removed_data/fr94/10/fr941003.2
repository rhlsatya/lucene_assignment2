Addition of One Genetically Engineered Tomato Line to Determination of 
Nonregulated Status for Calgene, Inc. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is announcing that it 
has added one genetically engineered tomato line to those subject to its 
October 19, 1992, interpretive ruling for FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes, that the subject FLAVR SAVR

TM

 lines need no longer be regulated. The effect of this 
action is that one additional delayed-softening tomato line, which has been 
modified by the addition of genetic material identical to that added to other 
tomato lines covered by the initial determination and is designated by Calgene 
as FLAVR SAVR

TM

 line N73 1436-111, will also no longer be subject to regulation 
under 7 CFR part 340.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 19, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 47608-47616, Docket No. 92-087-2) a notice announcing the issuance of an interpretive ruling
that the Calgene, Inc., FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato does not 
present a plant pest risk and is not a regulated article under the regulations 
contained in 7 CFR part 340. That action was in response to a petition 
submitted by Calgene seeking a determination from APHIS that its FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato no longer be deemed a regulated article based on an absence of plant pest risk. The effect of the action was that
previously field-tested lines of the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato and their descendants would no longer be regulated under the regulations in 7 CFR part 340. 


FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes were defined by Calgene in its initial petition to include any tomatoes transformed with one of seven identified
plasmid vectors that all carry an antisense copy of the tomato polygalacturonase gene and a bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase
gene with associated regulatory sequences. Calgene's initial request to APHIS in 1992 was for a determination pertaining
to all FLAVR SAVR

TM

 transformants produced in tomato using any one 
of the seven plasmid vectors. Calgene indicated in its petition that data 
provided to APHIS was representative of the data gathered for all lines tested 
up to that time. The initial determination announced by APHIS on October 19, 
1992, only applied to those lines that had already been field tested. 
However, APHIS indicated that new lines were likely to exhibit properties 
similar to those of lines already field tested under permit. The 
determination also allowed for cross-breeding of the identified FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato lines with any other lines or cultivars of tomato without permit. 
The new line that is the subject of this notice was a new transformant 
produced using one of the same plasmid vectors that were previously reviewed 
in our October 19, 1992, determination. Line N73 1436-111 has been field 
tested in accordance with APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Data provided 
to APHIS indicates that the new transformant line, produced in a manner 
identical to the earlier transformant lines, behaves similarly to those 
earlier FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato lines to which the determination initially applied. Reports from field trials and other data indicate that
tomato line N73 1436-111 grows normally, exhibits the expected morphological, reproductive, and physiological
properties, and does not have unexpected pest or disease susceptibility or symptoms. Therefore, APHIS' determination
of nonregulated status of October 19, 1992, is considered to apply to this new transformant line as well.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White House Information Infrastructure
Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and
the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating
and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII).



The Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights represents the Working Group's
examination and analysis to date of the intellectual property implications of the NII, and includes the Group's draft
findings and recommendations. While it addresses each of the major areas of intellectual property law, including
patents, trademarks and trade secrets, the preliminary draft focuses primarily on copyright law and its application
and effectiveness in the context of the NII.

<DOCTITLE>Public Hearing and Request for Comments on Commercial Security on the National Information Infrastructure</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public hearing and request for public comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Security Issues Forum of the Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) and Mega-Project III of the U.S. National Information
Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIIAC) request public input on issues associated with the security of commercial
products and services on the National Information Infrastructure (NII). Interested members of the public, especially
representatives from the entertainment, computing and software industries, are invited to participate in a public
hearing and to submit written comments on any of the topics outlined in the supplementary information section of this
notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






I. Issues for Public Comment 


A. Background




The National Information Infrastructure is a system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and
advanced computer systems that will make electronic information and entertainment products more widely available
and accessible to the public than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will dramatically
affect the way information and entertainment products are created, marketed and delivered throughout the world.
Consequently, the commercial viability of the NII hinges not only upon effectively promoting and encouraging use
of the NII by types of users, but also upon implementing standards, policies and practices that ensure that the owners
of products can effectively control access to and the integrity of their electronically disseminated products and
services. In this regard, it is essential that the public and private sectors collaborate to ensure that the interests
of owners and users of intellectual property are adequately considered in any discussion of proposed standards and
policies that may be established.

To address the issues raised by the NII, the President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The
mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision for the NII. The IITF is working with
the private sector, public interest groups, Congress and State and local governments, to develop comprehensive
telecommunications and information policies and programs that best meet the country's needs. The IITF is chaired
by the Secretary of Commerce and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise in the technical
and legal areas of particular importance to the NII. The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF
to address the cross-cutting issue of security on the NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.



In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council
(NIIAC). The NIIAC represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce
on issues relating to the NII. The Council has established three Mega-Projects which will form the backbone for initial
programmatic work of the NIIAC. Mega-Project III, co-chaired by John Cooke of the Disney Channel and Esther Dyson
of EDVenture, is responsible for addressing security, intellectual property and privacy issues as they relate to
the NII.



B. Structure and Content of Public Hearing




Security is linked inextricably to the commercial success of the NII. The policies and procedures used to ensure the
confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted products and services on the
NII will determine whether, how, and at what cost such products and services will be made available. Without the existence
of appropriate legal, technical and policy mechanisms, the potential of the NII to be a commercially viable means
for delivering digital products and services cannot be realized.


Development of policies and procedures that will ensure commercial security of intellectual property on the NII
requires study from different perspectives. One such perspective is the legal protection of intellectual property.
This topic is presently being addressed by the IITF Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Bruce
A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. The Working Group on Intellectual
Property has recently released a preliminary report on intellectual property issues on the NII and has conducted
a series of public hearings to receive views on the preliminary report and any other concerns about intellectual property
raised by the NII.

<DOCNO> FR941003-2-00013 </DOCNO>

A second perspective concerns a more functional approach to protecting intellectual property; namely, what legal
measures, policy mechanisms, and technological solutions, or combinations thereof, aside from intellectual property
laws, can be used to effectively protect commercial products and services delivered or made accessible using the
NII. This latter topic is the subject that the Forum and Mega-Project III wish to develop through this public hearing.

The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input from parties who will produce and make accessible commercial products and
services via the NII, as well as users of such products and services. A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will
be assembled to discuss the following topics with a panel comprising the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks,
members of the Security Information Forum and members of Mega-Project III of the NIIAC, and to field questions and
comments from other members of the public:

1. What types of projects and services are you contemplating delivering or making available, or would you like to see
delivered or made available on the National Information Infrastructure?

2. What capacity do you want to provide to users of the NII to view, hear, retrieve, reproduce, modify or further distribute
your products and services? As a user of such products and services, what capabilities in this regard would you like
to see made available by content producers?

3. What commercial threats do you foresee in making products and services available via the NII, in terms of:

(a) Unauthorized access to or theft of products or services; and

(b) Integrity or confidentiality of information delivered or retrieved via the NII? 

4. What kinds of technical solutions are you aware of, or would you like to see developed, to address security concerns?






Note: 

Parties who wish to offer comments or suggestions regarding the adequacy of existing intellectual property laws
to address questions of commercial security on the NII should utilize the public comment process established by the
Working Group on Intellectual Property rights of the IITF. Copies of the draft report of this working group can be obtained
by contacting the Patent and Trademark Office by phone, fax or mail using the information provided in the addresses
section of this notice. Copies of the report may also be obtained via the Internet at the addresses listed in the addresses
section of this notice.



II. Guidelines for Participation in the Public Hearing



Participants in the public hearing will testify before a panel consisting of members of Mega-Project III of the NIIAC,
the Security Issues Forum and the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the IITF. The public hearings will
be chaired by Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.

Individuals who would like to participate as a witness must request an opportunity to do so no later than October 13,
1994. Each approved participant will be permitted to present brief opening remarks. Once each witness has presented
their opening remarks, a general discussion on the topics listed above will be conducted.

Individuals may offer comments or ask questions of the witnesses by requesting an opportunity to do so and being recognized
during the hearing by the chair of the meeting. Oral remarks offered in this fashion may not exceed three minutes. No
advance approval is required to attend, offer comments, or present questions during the hearing.

City of Crystal Falls, MI; Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings



September 27, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of the existing Crystal
Falls Project No. 11402. The Crystal Falls Project is located on the Paint River in Iron County, Michigan.

The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.

The staff's EA will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.

A draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be
presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.



Scoping Meetings



The FERC will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while the morning
meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited
to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. Staff
will also visit the project site on November 2, 1994, at 9 a.m.

Both scoping meetings will be held at the City Hall Auditorium, 401 Superior Avenue, Crystal Falls, Michigan. The
first meeting will be held on November 1, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and will focus primarily on issues of concern to
the general public. The second meeting will be held on November 2, 1994, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will focus primarily
on issues of concern to the resource agencies.

Prior to the meetings, a scoping document will be mailed to the list of interested parties. The scoping document identifies
resource issues to be addressed in the EA. Copies of the scoping document will also be available at the scoping meetings
or can be obtained by writing: FERC-Crystal Falls Project, c/o Elaine Bazarian, Stone and Webster, 245 Summer Street,
Boston, MA 02110.



Objectives



At the scoping meetings the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the EA; (2) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EA; (3) identify resource issues
that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the
staff's preliminary views.



Procedures



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal
record of the Commission proceedings. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly
identify themselves for the record.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.

Participants at the public meeting are asked to keep oral comments brief and concise to allow everyone the opportunity
to speak.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed
with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until
December 2, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Crystal Falls Project No.
11402.

All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the licensing proceeding are asked to refrain
from engaging staff or its contractor in discussions of the merits of the project outside of any announced meeting.

Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents
with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name appears on the official service list.

For further information, please contact Thomas Dean at (202) 219-2778.

<DOCTITLE>Pacific Gas & Electric Company; Intent to Conduct Environmental Scoping Meetings and Site Visit</DOCTITLE>



September 27, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicensing for the proposed Pit
1 Hydroelectric Project No. 2687-014. The project is located on the Fall and Pit Rivers, near the towns of Fall
River Mills, McArthur, and Burney, in Shasta County, California.

The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this hydroelectric project in accordance
with the National Environmental Policy Act.

In the EA, we will consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental effects of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include economic, financial, and engineering analyses.

The draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration by the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.



Scoping Meetings



Staff will hold two scoping meetings. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will be held on Thursday, October
27, 1994, at 9:00 AM, at the McArthur Fairgrounds, in McArthur, California. A scoping meeting oriented towards the
public will be held the same day at 6:00 PM, at the same location.

Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and assist the
staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA.

To help focus discussions at the meetings, a scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA will
be mailed to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the scoping document will also
be available at the scoping meetings.



Objectives



At the scoping meetings, the FERC staff will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the proposed
project, (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3)
identify reasonable alternatives to the proposal; (4) solicit from meeting participants all available information,
especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues
that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary
views.



Procedures



The scoping meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements, both oral and written, will become part
of the record of the Commission proceedings on the Pit 1 Project. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings
will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EA.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments
(an original and eight copies) may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426, until [COMMENT DATE].

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Pit 1 Hydroelectric Project,
FERC Project No. 2687-014.

Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party files comments or documents with
the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency,
they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.



Site Visit



A site visit to the Pit 1 Hydroelectric Project is planned for Wednesday, October 26, 1994. Those who wish to attend
should plan to meet at 10:00 AM at the McArthur, Fairgrounds, in McArthur, California. The site is located near the

140/a; 3) Deutsch $700, .8/d and 280/a; 4) Kubes $700, .8/d and 120/a; 5) Buccaneer $48,770, 570/d and 50,455/a, and
6) Northrup $31,000, 1376/d and 94,178/a.

Northern states that deliveries of the estimated total volumes to Peoples at these delivery points will be made pursuant
to Northern's existing transportation service agreements. Northern advises that the total volumes to be delivered
to the customer after the request do not exceed the total volumes authorized prior to the request. Northern states
it has sufficient capacity for the proposed changes without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed De Minimis Settlement Under Section 122(g) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act; in the Matter of American Chemical Services</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice of 

De Minimis 

Settlement: in accordance with Section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given of a 

de minimis 

settlement concerning past and estimated future response actions at the American Chemical Services (ACS) Site in
Griffith, Indiana. U.S. EPA Region 5 has submitted the proposed agreement to the U.S. Department of Justice for review
concurrent with this request for public comment. This settlement will not be finalized until the approval process
set forth in Section 122(g)(4) of CERCLA has been completed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

959 Respondents and the State of Indiana executed binding certifications of their consent to participate in the settlement.
The settlement may be amended to add additional parties.



The Respondents will pay approximately $23,649,894.84 in settlement payments for response costs related to the
American Chemical Services Site, including past response costs incurred by the State of Indiana, if the United States
Environmental Protection Agency determines that it will not withdraw or withhold its consent to the proposed settlement
after consideration of comments submitted pursuant to this office.
U.S. EPA may enter into this settlement under the authority of Section 122(g) of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes


de minimis 

settlements with potentially responsible parties (``PRPs'') that contributed hazardous substances to a site where
those contributions were small and where the toxicity of the substances contributed is not significantly different
from the other substances brought to the site. Pursuant to this authority, the agreement proposes to settle with generator
parties whose individual volume of hazardous substances sent to site does not exceed .08% of the total amount of hazardous
substances sent to the site. Settling 

de minimis 

PRPs will be required to pay their fair share of the past and estimated future response costs at the site based on a payment
of $3.76 per pound of hazardous substances that the party contributed to the Site. Certain reduction factors were
applied in determining the pounds sent by each company based upon the operations of the ACS facility at different time
periods. Some participants in the settlement also have presented ability to pay issues and have settled on that basis.
The estimated future response costs account for potential cost overruns, the potential for failure of the remedies
selected to clean up the site, and other risks.
A copy of the proposed administrative order on consent and additional background information relating to the settlement,
including a list of parties to the settlement, are available for review and may be obtained in person or by mail from
Steven Siegel, Mail Code CS-29A, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago,
Illinois 60604.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to the settlement for thirty days
from the date of publication of this notice.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for the financial institutions specified in 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

 The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed
receivership estates are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership
estates. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment
to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are
hereby determined to be worthless.

Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority


Part A, Chapter AG (Office of the General Counsel) (38 FR 17032, June 28, 1973, as amended most recently at 57 FR 10765,
March 30, 1992) and Part H, Chapter HF (Food and Drug Administration) 35 FR 3685, February 25, 1970, as amended most
recently at 59 FR 38482, July 28, 1994) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority
for the Department of Health and Human Services is amended to reflect an organizational change in the Office of the
General Counsel (OGC) and in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The OGC in the Office of the Secretary, HHS, and FDA find it in their common interest and interest of the Department to
test the efficacy of decentralizing the provision of legal services to FDA by establishing an organizational component
within FDA comprised of lawyers and support staff who will provide certain legal services exclusively to that Agency
and be funded by that Agency, but be subject to the supervision of the General Counsel with respect to legal policy and
direction. OGC will continue to provide legal services to FDA in the areas of ethics, business and administrative
law, legislation, personnel, and procurement on the same basis as OGC provides such services to other HHS operating
divisions generally. A new Office of the Chief Counsel will be established in FDAs Office of the Commissioner and simultaneously
the Food and Drug Division will be removed from OGC.
The following changes are made to reflect the organizational change:


Under Chapter AG, Section AG-B, Organization


1. Under Section AG.22 Divisions in the Office of the General Counsel delete subparagraph 4 Food and Drug Division
in its entirety.


Under Chapter HF, Section HF-B, Organization


2. Insert a new subparagraph under the Office of the Commissioner (HF), the Office of Chief Counsel (HFA-J) reading
as follows:


(a-6) Office of Chief Counsel (HFA-J). 

Subject to the professional supervision and control of the General Counsel, represents the FDA in court proceedings
and administrative hearings with respect to programs administered by the FDA.
Provides legal advice and policy guidance for programs administered by the FDA.
Acts as liaison to the Department of Justice and other Federal Departments for programs administered by FDA.
Drafts or reviews all proposed and final regulations and 

Federal Register

 notices prepared by FDA.
Performs legal research and gives legal opinions on regulatory issues, actions, and petitions submitted to FDA.
Reviews proposed legislation affecting FDA that originates in the Department or on which Congress requests the views
of the Department.
Provides legal advice and assistance to the Office of the Secretary on matters within the expertise of the Chief Counsel.

Medicaid Program; Charges for Vaccine Administration Under 
the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice with comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice with comment period lists, by State, 
the interim regional maximum charges that providers may 
impose for the administration of pediatric vaccines to 
Federally vaccine-eligible children under the Pediatric 
Immunization Distribution Program, more commonly known as 
the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. This notice also 
specifies the methodology that HCFA used to establish the 
maximum administration charges. 


In addition, the notice provides States that purchase 
vaccines for all children the option to use these maximum 
charges or devise their own, and clarifies that State 
Medicaid agencies may establish lower fees than these 
maximums if they can provide assurances of access to 
immunizations for Medicaid eligible children to the same 
extent as the general population. 
The publication of these administration charges is 
essential to implementation of the VFC program, which is 
mandated by law to become operational on October 1, 1994. 
We intend that this list be used on an interim basis until 
we issue a separate 

Federal Register

 document that will 
finalize these maximum regional charges and respond to any 
relevant public comments.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 
(OBRA '93), Public Law 103-66, created the Pediatric Vaccine 
Distribution Program (more commonly known and hereafter 
referred to as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program), 
which takes effect on October 1, 1994. Section 13631 of 
OBRA '93 added section 1902(a)(62) to the Social Security 
Act (the Act) to require that States provide for a program 
for the purchase and distribution of pediatric vaccines to 
program-registered providers for the immunization of vaccine 
eligible children in accordance with section 1928 of the 
Act. Section 13631 redesignated the existing section 1928 
as section 1931 and inserted a new section 1928. The new 
section 1928 requires each State to establish a VFC Program 
(which may be administered by the State department of 
health) under which certain specified groups of children are 
entitled to receive qualified pediatric immunizations 
without charge for the cost of the vaccine.

Federally purchased vaccines under the VFC Program will 
be made available to children who are 18 years of age or 
younger and_
 Who are eligible for Medicaid; 
 Who are not insured under any form of health 
insurance; 
 Who are not insured with respect to the vaccine and 
who are administered pediatric vaccines by a federally 
qualified health center (FQHC) or in a rural health clinic; 
or 
 Who are Indians, as defined in section 4 of the Indian 
Health Care Improvement Act. 

Under the VFC program, vaccines must be administered by 
program-registered providers. Section 1928(c) defines a 
program-registered provider as any health care provider 
that_
 Is licensed or authorized to administer pediatric 
vaccines under the law of the State in which the 
administration occurs without regard to whether or not the 
provider is a Medicaid-participating provider; 
 Submits to the State an executed provider agreement in 
the form and manner specified by the Secretary; and 
 Has not been found by the Secretary or the State to 
have violated a provider agreement or other requirements 
that may apply that are established by the Secretary or the 
State. 
Providers may participate in the VFC program without 
participating in Medicaid if they are qualified to 
administer vaccines under applicable State law. However, 
such providers will not be reimbursed by Medicaid for their 
services in administering the vaccine. 
Under the VFC Program, a provider may impose a fee for 
the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine as long 
as the fee, in the case of a Federally vaccine-eligible 
child, does not exceed the cost of such administration (as 
determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs 
for such administration). However, a provider may not deny 
administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a 
vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child's 
parents or legal guardian to pay the administration fee. 


II. Provisions of This Notice With Comment Period 


A. General Statement 


This notice announces interim regional maximum charges. 
These represent the maximum amount that a provider in a 
State may charge for the administration of qualified 
pediatric vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children 
under the VFC Program. It also specifies the methodology that HCFA used to establish these regional maximum charges.

We are interpreting ``regional'' as specified in the statute 
to be the ``State'', as discussed in section II.B.2. of this 
notice. In addition, this notice gives Universal Purchase 
States (that is, where the vaccines are purchased by the 
State for all children in the State) the right to develop 
administration charges that differ from those established by 
HCFA, provided they are reasonable. Therefore, Universal 
Purchase States are provided the flexibility to accept the 
maximum charges established by the Secretary or to develop 
their own maximum charges. In either case, the statute 
gives State Medicaid agencies the option to establish and 
apply vaccine administration fees that are lower than the 
specified maximum charges if they provide assurances that 
Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same 
extent as the general population. Section 1902(a)(30)(A) of 
the Act, as amplified by section 1926, requires States to 
pay enough for obstetrical and pediatric services (which 
include immunization services) so that those services are 
available to the ``Medicaid population'' to the same extent 
that are available to the general population in the 
geographic area. These assurances must be submitted to HCFA 
as part of the appropriate State plan amendment to impose 
the fees. This notice specifies guidelines for States to 
use in setting lower administration fees.

The administration charge cap applies to all VFC Program-registered providers that administer the vaccine to a Federally
vaccine-eligible child. It does not apply to children receiving free vaccines under State purchase programs or any
other arrangement. 

In accordance with the statute, physicians participating in the VFC Program can charge non-Medicaid eligible children
the maximum administration charge (if that charge reflects the provider's cost of administration) regardless of
whether the State has established a lower administration fee under the Medicaid program. However, there would be
no Federal Medicaid matching funds available for such administration. Although the cost of the vaccines for the VFC
Program is funded under Title XIX of the Act, Medicaid will not pay for the administration of vaccines provided to children
under the VFC Program who are not eligible for Medicaid. A provider may only bill Medicaid for the administration of
a vaccine if the child is Medicaid eligible. 

Because the VFC program is mandated by law to become operational on October 1, 1994, we are announcing these regional
maximum administration charges and guidelines for documenting access on an interim basis, subject to comment and
revision. We will issue a final 

Federal Register

 document setting forth the applicable requirements and responding to public comments on the provisions of this notice
that we receive on a timely basis. 



B. Methodology Used to Establish Administration Charges 



We used the following methodology to establish the regional maximum charges for administration of qualified pediatric
vaccines set forth under section II.C. of this notice. 



1. Basis for Using Charge Data versus Cost Data 



As noted above, the statute provides that these maximum charges are to be based in the actual costs of vaccine administration,
as determined by the Secretary. This provision posed a serious implementation problem for HCFA because of the unavailability
of usable actual cost data on a nationwide basis and the urgency of promulgating maximum fees before the VFC program
begins operation. We searched thoroughly for appropriate data on the costs of vaccine administration. We also consulted
with several organizations and with individuals with knowledge and expertise in issues regarding physician payment,
including the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC). We were informed that there are no data readily available
on physicians' actual costs that would provide a valid basis for setting these maximum charges on a nationwide scale.
It also was apparent to us that it would not be possible to generate such data via field research within the time available
to implement the VFC program on October 1, 1994. A proper analysis would require detailed, expensive, and time-consuming
collection and evaluation of data on each element of both direct and indirect costs, including equipment, supplies
and labor, as well as an appropriate verification and allocation of ``overhead'' costs. 

On the basis of this information, we concluded that we should explore setting the maximum charges based on data regarding
actual charges for the administration of vaccines in physicians' offices. This, too, posed a problem. We consulted
with insurance companies, physicians' groups, trade associations, the PPRC, and other knowledgeable experts.
Again, we concluded that accurate, consistent data on charges were not readily available. There are a number of concerns
about the data that are available, including inconsistencies in the coding of procedures and the fact that most payers
do not differentiate, or pay separately for, the cost of the vaccine and its administration. In light of these problems,
we were unable to construct a reliable data base by integrating data from existing information sources. 

We concluded that it would be necessary to generate a data base specifically for this purpose. For the reasons stated
above, it was not feasible to generate a data base using actual costs, but it was feasible to do one based on charges.
In the absence of valid studies to the contrary, we think that, for this particular service, charge data is a reasonable
proxy for setting these maximum fees until we are able to obtain cost data. Our conclusion is reinforced by the provision
of the statute requiring physicians to agree not to refuse to vaccinate a child because of the family's inability to
pay the administration fee and by the knowledge that many physicians currently either do not bill indigent patients
their full charge or accept less than full payment from them. 

Given the statutory requirements that the administration fees not exceed the costs of administration, we recognize
the importance of utilizing cost data in developing the regional maximum charges. We also realize that the use of charge
data in developing the maximum charges may result in maximum charges that are too high. While it appears that there
are no useable cost data readily available, our goal is to obtain information that can be used in setting maximum charges
in the future. We will be conducting a study to accumulate accurate cost data, and will revise the maximum charges based
on cost as soon as possible. 

The fiscal year 1995 Department of Health and Human Services appropriations bill specifically addresses the use
of charge versus cost data. (140 Cong. Rec. H9306, Sept. 20, 1994) The Secretary is directed to compute the actual cost
of administering vaccines and to revise the fees in accordance with the requirements of the law. Because the appropriations
bill also states that this directive is not intended to delay the start-up of the VFC program, we will utilize the interim
maximum charges. However, as stated above, we will conduct a study with the goal of obtaining accurate cost data and
will issue revised maximum charge amounts as soon as possible. 



2. Charge Data Methodology 



To obtain a data base of physician charges, we contracted with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to purchase
data on the normal fee charged by its members for administering the vaccines to be covered by this program. (We note
that AAP did not believe it could obtain cost data by directly surveying its membership.) The AAP had gathered these
data from a national, sample survey of its members. The sample was large enough (approximately 1,114 responses) to
give us confidence in the national average, but not large enough in each State to allow us to set state-by-state maximum
charges without further adjustment. The preliminary results of the survey indicated that the overall average administration
charge was $14.48. The final national average administration charge we obtained from the AAP was $15.09.

<TEXT>
 

In order to adjust this national average for regional variations, we concluded that the most reliable means available
was the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) established for the Medicare physician fee schedule. 

The GPCI is an index developed by a joint effort of the Urban Institute (UI) and the Center for Health Economics Research
(CHER) to measure the differences in resource cost among localities compared to the national average in the three
components of the relative value units_physician work, practice expenses, excluding malpractice, and malpractice.
These three components are weighted 54.2 percent, 40.2 percent, and 5.6 percent, respectively. The resource inputs
and their weights were obtained from the American Medical Association's (AMA) Socioeconomic Characteristics of
Medical Practice. The weights for the current GPCIs are from the AMA's l989 Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS)
Survey. 

If there is more than one GPCI for a State, we used the GPCI with the highest values to derive the maximum charge in order
to assure that the administration charge for providers in high cost areas would fall within our established maximum.


The GPCIs are grouped by State and substate areas. For purposes of developing the regional maximum charges, we interpreted
the term ``regional'' used in the statute to mean ``State'' because of the specific grouping of the data using the GPCIs.
While the GPCI is grouped by State and substate areas, we decided to use the State grouping only. The geographic area
of a State is clearly identifiable by boundary lines recognized nationwide, as opposed to a substate area. In other
words, substate areas do not necessarily represent counties, which would be an easily identifiable geographic area.
Therefore, we believe using substate geographic areas would be confusing to both States and providers. 

We derived the amounts specified in the chart under section II.C. of this notice as the maximum charges that may be charged
for the administration of qualified pediatric vaccines for each State on the basis of the following formula: National
charge data  x  total weighted GPCI = maximum charge. 

Following is an example of application of the formula for Hawaii: 


 


Average national administration 

 charge = $15.09 


Work expense = 1.003 
Practice expense = 1.094 
Malpractice expense = 1.025 


 


Using Medicare weights to weigh components of_ 


 

Work expense = 54.2 percent 
Practice expense = 40.2 percent 
Malpractice expense = 5.6 percent 


 


 


Hawaii's maximum charge for administration of the vaccine is: 



$15.09  x  1.0408 = $15.71 


 


Given the circumstances discussed in the beginning of section II.B. of this notice, the maximum charge will be based
on charge data and will be applicable until we are able to obtain cost data. Our goal is to obtain information that can
be used in setting maximum charges in the future. We will revise the regional maximum charges as we determine it is necessary,
or in response to public comments.

C. Maximum Regional Charges for Vaccine Administration by State 


Based on the methodology described, the maximum administration charges are as follows: 




D. Maximum Charges for Administration of Vaccines in Universal Purchase States 


States that have programs under which the State purchases vaccines for all children in the State (Universal Purchase
States) have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges.
We believe it is necessary that Universal Purchase States are provided sufficient flexibility in developing charges
in order to ensure that there is equal access to immunizations for all children. In these States, we believe the State
may wish to set one overall charge cap in order to encourage adequate provider participation. Furthermore, it is our
understanding that providers should experience no cost differences between VFC program eligible children and all
other children inasmuch as the provider never incurs the cost of the vaccine.

<TEXT>
 

While Universal Purchase States have the flexibility to develop their own caps, they must develop these by utilizing
a reasonable methodology based upon the requirements of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act. The amount of the cap
is not required to be set in State law. However, the authority to set an amount must be based in State law. 


E. Optional Lower Medicaid Administration Fees 


State Medicaid agencies are not obligated to set the Medicaid payment for vaccine administration at the level of the
maximum charges set forth in this notice. Section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act allows them to set their payment at
a lower level, according to their own judgment. State Medicaid agencies typically set payment rates taking into consideration
a variety of factors, including the need to assure adequate participation by providers. Since the maximum charges
in this notice are based on the normal charges billed by physicians, rather than on the amounts actually collected
by physicians from insurers or patients, State Medicaid agencies may determine that a lower payment level is appropriate.

If the State Medicaid agency elects to pay a lower fee, it must provide assurances to HCFA, as described below, that
Medicaid-eligible children will have access to vaccines. In addition, a State Medicaid agency may elect to apply
the regional maximum charges in selected areas of the State and a lower fee in other areas. Any lower fees that a State
Medicaid agency elects to apply must be justified using the guidelines specified in section II.F. of this notice.

In the case of Universal Purchase States that elect to develop their own maximum charges, State Medicaid agencies
have the flexibility to pay the maximum charge or to pay a lower fee subject to the same provisions discussed above.



F. Documentation Guidelines for Optional Lower Medicaid Administration Fees 


1. Pediatric Services Defined 


As defined in section 1926(a)(4)(B) of the Act, the term ``pediatric services'' means ``services covered under the
State plan provided by a pediatrician, family practitioner, or certified pediatric nurse practitioner to children
under 18 years of age and does not include inpatient or outpatient hospital services or other institutional services.''



2. Immunization Rate 


In applying any of the guidelines under section II.F.3. of this notice, we believe it is necessary to identify what
children would be considered immunized. In order to be counted toward the immunization rate goals discussed, a child
must have received, within the year period of measure for access, all immunizations required for his or her particular
age, including those immunizations under a revised schedule because of those missed from a previous year. 


3. Data Requirements 


If the State elects to pay an administration fee lower than the maximum charge set forth in section II.C. of this notice,
it must provide, via the obstetrical/pediatric State plan amendment submittal, data that document that the lower
or varying fees meet the statutory requirements of sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act and the implementing
regulatory requirements of 42 CFR 447.204. Section 447.204 of the regulations specify that a Medicaid agency's payments
must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that services under the plan are available to recipients at least
to the extent that those services are available to the general population. 
The State may use one or more of the following guidelines to document that the statutory and regulatory requirements
are met: 


a. Comparison of Ratios 


Under this guideline, the State would submit a comparison between the following ratios: 
(i) The ratio of the number of children in the general population immunized to the number of children in the general
population; and 
(ii) The ratio of the number of Medicaid children immunized to the number of Medicaid children. 

In order for a State to use this guideline as an equal access assurance, the ratio of Medicaid children immunized to
the number of Medicaid children would have to be equal to or greater than the ratio of the general population immunized
to the number of children in the general population. 


b. Comparison to Private Insurance 


Another alternative is for the State to do a comparison of the Medicaid fees for administration of pediatric vaccines
to the administration fees paid by a major insurance company. 
In order for the State to use this guideline as an equal access assurance, the Medicaid rates for the administration
of pediatric vaccines would have to be set at a rate equal to or greater than the private insurance company's rates up
to the established State maximum fee. 


c. Practitioner Participation 


The State also may compare: 
(i) The number of Medicaid pediatric practitioners (which includes practitioners listed in section 1926(a)(4)(B)
of the Act) who are Medicaid program- registered providers and who have submitted pediatric immunization claims;
and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941003-2-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The total number of pediatric practitioners providing immunizations to children. 

The program registered providers must have at least one Medicaid pediatric immunization claim per month or an average
of 12 such claims during the year. The State would need 50 percent participation to show equal access through use of
this guideline. 



d. Other 



States have the flexibility to devise alternative measures of equal access to immunizations. HCFA will evaluate
these other methods by which States can choose to demonstrate equal access. 



G. Submittal of State Plan Amendments 



A State Medicaid agency must specify the reimbursement for the administration of pediatric vaccines (and, if applicable,
submit documentation of equal access) as part of its obstetrical/pediatric payment rate State Medicaid plan amendment
submittal that are due by April 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 1995 (and which are effective July 1, 1995). If the
State Medicaid agency elects to pay the maximum regional amount statewide (including that established by the State
in Universal Purchase States), it need only specify this in its State plan amendment submittal (no additional documentation
will be needed). However, if the State Medicaid agency elects to vary the vaccine administration fee by geographic
areas within the State, the State must list the administration fee for each area, and specify the methodology, and
provide the data and methodology it used to demonstrate equal access to the vaccines for each geographic area where
the maximum charges are not applied. This documentation requirement is consistent with the requirements currently
imposed for submittal of State Medicaid plan amendments for obstetrical and pediatric payment rates under sections
1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act. We also believe that documenting access to immunizations by each geographic area
provides a more accurate picture of access and areas where access is problematic. 

The State plan amendment must be submitted by December 31, 1994 and be effective on October 1, 1994. For the interim
period of October 1, 1994 through March 31, 1995, States may claim Federal matching funds for the costs of administration
of vaccines to Medicaid-eligible children using the maximum charges or the lower fees established on the basis of
the guidance provided in this notice. For this interim State plan amendment, the State will not be required to submit
the data to document access to immunizations but will be required to list the methodology by which Medicaid beneficiary
access to immunizations is assured. Beginning April 1, 1995, documentation of equal access to immunizations will
be required to be included as part of the yearly Obstetrical/Pediatric State plan amendment submittal in accordance
with section 1926 of the Act. 



III. Impact Statement 



For notices such as this, we generally prepare a flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a notice will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of a RFA, States and individuals are not considered
small entities. However, providers are considered small entities. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
of proposed rulemaking that may have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act,
we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer
than 50 beds.

This notice with comment period implements a provision of section 1928 of the Act. Specifically, this notice with
comment period announces interim regional maximum charges that providers may impose for administering pediatric
vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children under the VFC Program. Section 1928 of the Act directs the Secretary
to establish regional maximum fees. As discussed in section II. B of this notice, HCFA contracted with the American
Academy of Pediatrics to conduct a survey to obtain national charge data for the administration of pediatric vaccines.
HCFA used this data to develop a national charge amount and then adjusted this amount to take into account regional
variations to establish a charge for each State. The GPCIs established for the Medicare physician fee schedule were
used to make this adjustment. Universal Purchase States have the flexibility to accept the maximum charges developed
by HCFA or to develop their own maximum charges. HCFA is also permitting State Medicaid agencies to develop a lower
administration fee than the maximum charge if they can demonstrate equal access for children to the vaccines. 

The impact of implementing the provision of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act is discussed further below. We do
not believe that this provision will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. 

To the extent that a legislative provision being implemented by a notice such as this may have a significant effect
on recipients or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns.
In this instance, it is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact of this notice will be. There are several unknown
factors. Among them are the number of program-eligible providers who will elect to administer the vaccines. In addition,
State Medicaid agencies are not required to pay the maximum charges. State Medicaid agencies may establish and apply
lower vaccine administration fees if they document that Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same
extent as the general population. Given the availability of free vaccines and the fact that State payments for all
pediatric and obstetrical services, including, presumably, vaccine administration, have for some time been subject
to access demonstration requirements under 42 CFR 447.204 and sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act, we believe
that a large proportion of States will be able to demonstrate equal access for Medicaid-eligible children at rates
lower than the maximum charges. In addition, should a State Medicaid agency not be able to demonstrate equal access
at its current rates, the State Medicaid agency would only have to increase its rates to where there would be equal access.
The publication of the maximum charge schedule will certainly create pressure in States with vaccine administration
fees for Medicaid-eligible children lower than the maximums to raise those fees. However, to the extent that these
States can provide the required assurances, they will not need to raise their fees. (Currently, it appears that most
States pay for vaccine administration under Medicaid at rates well below the proposed maximum. This is allowable
under the statute.) 

Hence, the magnitude of any increase in Medicaid outlays is difficult to ascertain. Because of the pre-existing equal
access demonstration requirements, we find it hard to estimate how much of any increase in charges would be attributable
to the specific guidelines of this notice and how much would occur without publication of the notice. We invite public
comment on the impact of both the equal access assurances and anticipated fee increases. 

We are providing a voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis because of the large number of children and providers
who may be affected. Normally, a regulatory flexibility analysis requires the agency to discuss various alternatives
to the provisions in a notice. As discussed above, however, HCFA is implementing the provisions of section 1928(c)(2)(C)(ii)
of the Act. The focus of this legislation is upon expanding the number of children who are eligible to receive free pediatric
vaccines. We have provided State Medicaid agencies with an option of using a lower fee than the maximum charges set
forth in this notice or using a charge established by a Universal Purchase State at their option if they can demonstrate
equal access of children to the pediatric vaccines. Because indicated Congressional intent was to expand the coverage
for vaccines, we believe that permitting State Medicaid agencies to use a lower fee where they can demonstrate equal
access of children to the pediatric vaccines is consistent with the statute. In addition, we note that this option,
if utilized by State Medicaid agencies, will cost Federal and State governments less money than if the State Medicaid
agencies were using the maximum regional charges as set forth in this notice, while simultaneously achieving Congress'
goal. 

A brief summary of the impact of the provisions of this notice with comment period upon various groups is provided below.




1. Providers 



Each program-registered provider who administers a qualified pediatric vaccine is entitled to receive the vaccine
without charge either for the vaccine or its delivery to the provider. This notice specifically establishes maximum
regional charges for providers to administer the vaccines. As a result of these maximum regional charges, we believe
that the number of providers who may be willing to administer the vaccines would be maintained or increased. In addition
to a potential increase in the number of providers who may be willing to administer these vaccines, there may be an increase
in the number of patients that they treat since section 1928 of the Act expands the number of children who are eligible
to receive the vaccine without charge. 



2. Children 



The greatest benefit of this provision is that it expands the number of children who are eligible to receive pediatric
vaccines without charge for the vaccines. We believe that there will be an increase in the number of children receiving
pediatric vaccines. As the number of children who are vaccinated increases, we believe that savings will accrue as
a result of a decline in the number of children who will require treatment for vaccine-preventable 
illnesses.

3. States 



States may also benefit under various provisions of the 
VFC Program. Specifically, this program will provide free 
vaccines and free delivery to States thus saving States 
monies that would otherwise be spent on purchase and 
delivery of vaccines. Where they can demonstrate equal 
access, State Medicaid agencies are given the option of 
using the regional charge as specified in this notice or a 
lower fee. States could experience an increase in the 
number of children who are receiving the vaccines, thus 
achieving Congress' goal though increasing their pediatric 
immunization costs. As discussed above, fewer children may 
be treated for vaccine-preventable illnesses which may 
provide a savings to the States. 

We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we 
have determined, and the Secretary has certified, that this 
notice with comment period will not have a significant 
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small 
rural hospitals. 

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
12866, this notice was reviewed by the Office of Management 
and Budget.

Education and Service Linkage 



As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.




Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Other Considerations 



In addition, funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 

A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary program, or favorable adjustment of the formula
which determines the grant award in a formula grant program. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



Statutory General Preference 



All of the Family Medicine Training grant programs are subject to the statutory general preference. As provided in
section 791(a) of the PHS Act, statutory preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ 

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 

This statutory preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended
for approval by the peer review group. 

For Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family Medicine, the following definitions apply: 

High rate 

is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates of the medical school in academic year 1989-90 or 1990-91.




Significant increase in the rate

 means that the rate of placing academic year 1990-91 graduates in the specified settings is at least 50 percent
higher than the rate of placing academic year 1989-90 graduates in such settings and that not less than 15 percent
of academic year 1990-91 graduates are working in these areas. Academic years 1989-90 and 1990-91
are used because they are the two most recent years that medical school graduates would have entered practice following
the completion of residency training. 

For Grants for Graduate Training in Family Medicine, the following definitions apply: 

High rate 

is defined as a minimum of 25 percent of combined graduates of the residency training program in academic years 1991-92
through 1993-94. 



Significant increase in the rate 

means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified
settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year
are working in these areas. 

For Grants for Family Medicine Faculty Development, the following definitions apply: 

High rate

 is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of faculty development/fellowship program graduates in academic year 1992-93
or academic year 1993-94, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in the specified
settings. 



Significant increase in the rate

 means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate of placing faculty development/fellowship
program graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of the academic year 1993-1994 graduates are working in these areas.

For Grants for the Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine, the following definitions apply: 

High rate 

means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1990 or 1991, whichever is greater, are spending at least
50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings. 



Significant increase in the rate

 means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate of placing 1990 or 1991 graduates in the
specified settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most
recent year (1991) are working in these settings. 

Additional general information regarding the implementation of the statutory general preference has been published
in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 15741, dated 4/4/94. 



Additional Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for the Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine 



An additional statutory funding preference applies only to Grants for the Establishment of Departments of Family
Medicine. Under section 747(b), a funding preference is provided for qualified applicants that agree to expend the
award for the purpose of: (1) Establishing an academic administrative unit defined as a department, division, or
other unit, for programs in family medicine; or (2) substantially expanding the programs of such a unit. 



Information Requirements Provision 



All of the Family Medicine Training grant programs are subject to the information requirements provision. Under
section 791(b) of the Act, the Secretary may make an award under certain title VII grant programs only if the applicant
for the award submits to the Secretary the following required information: 

1. A description of rotations or preceptorships for students, or clinical training programs for residents, that
have the principal focus of providing health care to medically underserved communities. 

2. The number of faculty on admissions committees who have a clinical practice in community-based ambulatory settings
in medically underserved communities. 

3. With respect to individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds or from medically underserved communities,
the number of such individuals who are recruited for academic programs of the applicant, the number of such individuals
who are admitted to such programs, and the number of such individuals who graduate from such programs. 

4. If applicable, the number of recent graduates who have chosen careers in primary health care. 

5. The number of recent graduates whose practices are serving medically underserved communities. 

6. A description of whether and to what extent the applicant is able to operate without Federal assistance under this
title. 

Additional details concerning the implementation of this information requirement have been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 43642, dated August 17, 1993, and will be provided in the application materials.

Grants for Residency Training in General Internal Medicine and General Pediatrics 
Grants for Faculty Development in General Internal Medicine and General Pediatrics 




Competing applications for grants authorized under sections 747 and 748 are reviewed by chartered review committees.
It is proposed that the following review criteria and weighted indicators be used by the chartered review committees
for the FY 1995 grant cycles. Public comments are invited on the one proposed review criterion and the weighted indicators
associated with all four review criteria. 

This review criterion and weighted indicators are proposed in this combined notice, rather than in individual program
announcements, to provide consistent review of all primary care medical education grant applications. A funding
notice for Grants for Family Medicine Training for FY 1995 has been published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register.

 A funding notice for Grants for General Internal Medicine and General Pediatrics will be published should funds become
available for competitive cycles in FY 1995. Deadline dates and other specific information regarding these grant
programs are included in funding notices. 



General Purposes 



Grants provided in support of primary care medical education are intended to produce, over time, a training infrastructure
capable of meeting the nation's needs for generalist health care practitioners by the year 2000 and beyond. 

The Division of Medicine (DM), Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), has developed the following Strategic Directions
for fiscal year 1995: 

 Generalism_increasing the number of generalist physicians, including the coordination and integration
of training opportunities designed to produce generalists; 

 Workforce diversity, particularly the training of minorities; 

 Strategies to improve health care for the underserved; 

 Improve primary care quality; 

 Increase primary care faculty and researchers; and 

 Emphasize public health and interdisciplinary training. 

Applicants are encouraged to consider each application as part of an integrated institutional plan that considers
these strategic directions in providing education and training that encourages the selection and future practice
of generalist physicians in the disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics.




Review Criteria 



Considering charter review committee recommendations, the Secretary will approve projects which best promote
the purposes of sections 747 and 748 of the PHS Act, taking into consideration the following review criteria established
in 42 CFR part 57, subparts Q, R, and FF. 

1. The administrative and management ability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective
manner. 

2. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the period of grant support. 

3. The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for the project requirements. 

In addition, the following review criterion is proposed for FY 1995: 

4. Potential effectiveness of the proposed project in carrying out the training purposes of sections 747 or 748 of
the PHS Act. 

For the above review criteria, weighted indicators have been identified. These indicators, which are listed below,
will measure, among other things, the qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty, the institution's commitment
to preparing generalist physicians, and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and disadvantaged
faculty, students, trainees and/or residents. These issues have been addressed in previous grant cycles as review
criteria or funding factors. The review criteria and indicators were developed for the FY 1995 grant cycle with input
from potential applicants for these grant programs.

The points available for the various grant programs in the ``Potential Effectiveness'' criterion vary slightly.
This is a result of a small number of indicators that are specific to individual grant programs. In general, this category
relates to the overall institutional environment in which the program is located and the manner of support for establishing
or enhancing the training of generalist physicians at the institution. 

The ``Administrative and Management Ability'' review criterion has the highest number of points and is consistent
across all grant programs because this area of the application will describe the proposed project for which the grant
funds are being requested. The proposal needs to clearly detail the proposed project as well as relate the proposed
project to the institution's overall goal of establishing or enhancing its training infrastructure in order to produce
more generalist physicians to meet the needs of the Nation. 

The ``Economic Viability'' points are consistent across all grant programs. 

The ``Project Requirements'' points vary considerably for some programs. This is related to the differing number
of project requirements specific to each grant program as well as the significance of some of the indicators. For example,
for Family Medicine Residencies, the points are lower to reflect the fact that residency programs that are accredited
or approved by the appropriate accrediting body, have already met the project requirements.

A. SBIR Program Phases, Award Amounts, and Period of Support 


The SBIR Program consists of the following three phases: 


Phase I 


The objective of this phase is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of proposed research or R&D efforts
and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization before furnishing further
Federal support in Phase II. Phase I awards will be approximately $35,000 to $50,000 (for both direct and indirect
costs) for a period not to exceed 12 months. 


Phase II 


The objective of this phase is to continue the research or R&D efforts initiated in Phase I and to actually create
the proposed product and test it before marketing. Funding is based on the results of Phase I and the scientific and
technical merit of the Phase II application, including its potential for commercialization. (Only Phase I awardees
are eligible to apply for Phase II funding.) Phase I awardees are eligible to apply for Phase II funding only from the
Federal agency that supported their Phase I project. Phase II awards will be approximately $100,000 (for both direct
and indirect costs) for a period normally not to exceed 12 months. 


Phase III 


The objective of this phase, if appropriate, is for the small business concern to pursue with non-Federal funds the
commercialization of the results of the research or R&D in Phases I and II. 
The purpose of this notice is to invite Phase I and II grant applications from for-profit domestic small business concerns
that have the expertise to develop or further develop innovative technology. This technology should be compatible
with the general mission of HCFA and contribute to the health care field. HCFA is responsible for the Medicare program,
Federal participation in the Medicaid program, and related health care quality assurance programs. HCFA's mission
is to promote the timely delivery of appropriate quality health care to its Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients;
over 50 million of the nation's aged, disabled, and poor. HCFA must also ensure that Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients are aware of the services for which they are eligible. In addition, HCFA must ensure that those services
are accessible and of high quality. 
In carrying out its mission, HCFA conducts studies and projects that examine and demonstrate payment, coverage,
eligibility, and management alternatives to the present programs. HCFA also studies the impact of HCFA programs
on health care costs, program expenditures, beneficiary and recipient access to services, health care providers,
and the health care segment of the American economy. 
In addition, HCFA monitors national health care expenditures and prices and provides analyses of the costs of current
programs, as well as the impact of possible legislative or administrative changes in the programs. HCFA's Office
of Research and Demonstrations (ORD) is responsible for the technical aspects of the SBIR Program described in this
section. 
This notice outlines the eligibility requirements for organizations wishing to participate in the HCFA SBIR Program
and the research grant application and review processes. It also provides both general program information as well
as specific research topics and subtopics that may be of interest to small business concerns. 
Although areas of special programmatic interest or priority are described in section VII. of this notice, we will
consider grant applications in any area within the field of health care R&D unless otherwise specifically excluded.
However, we are not generally interested in funding the biomedical or clinical projects that more appropriately
fit the mission of the National Institutes of Health.

B. Eligibility 


Each organization submitting a grant application under our SBIR Program must qualify as a small business concern.
``Small business concern'' is defined in section II.F. of this notice. In determining whether an applicant is a small
business concern, an assessment will be made of several factors, including whether it is organized for profit, whether
it is independently owned and operated, and whether it meets the size requirement of 500 or fewer employees. Whether
the size requirement is met may depend on whether the applicant organization is affiliated with another organization
whose employees, when added to those of the applicant organization, exceed 500. In conducting this assessment, all
appropriate factors will be considered, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.

Affiliation exists when one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or there is third party control,
or an identity of interest between or among parties exists so that affiliation may be found. Control may be affirmative
or negative, and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the power to control exists. Indeed, control can
arise from a variety of circumstances. One example of a circumstance that could lead to a finding that an organization
is controlling, or has the power to control, another organization is the sharing of common office space, employees,
or other facilities (for example, laboratory space). Although access to special facilities or equipment in another
organization is permitted (as in cases in which the SBIR applicant has entered into a subcontractual agreement with
another institution for a specific, limited portion of the research project), research space occupied by an SBIR
applicant must be space that is not generally shared with another organization and over which the applicant has exclusive
control. When there is an indication of sharing of common employees, a determination will be made on a case- by-case
basis of whether the sharing constitutes control or the power to control. 
Additionally, control or the power to control is generally considered to exist when ``key employees of one concern
organize a new concern and serve as its officers, directors, principal stockholders, and/or key employees, and the
one concern is furnishing or will furnish the other concern with subcontracting financial or technical assistance,
bid or performance bond indemnification, and/or other facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise.'' Affiliation
can also arise between or among two or more persons when an identity of interest exists, such as members of the same family
or persons with common investments in more than one concern.

All SBIR grant applications will be reviewed with the above considerations in mind. Organizations considering submitting
an application are referred to the SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144) and to the regulations set forth at 13 CFR part 121 for further guidance regarding eligibility.
In particular, to determine whether affiliation exists, the applicant should also refer to 13 CFR 121.401 for the
definition of affiliation, which will be used as HCFA's guide on this matter. If it appears that an applicant organization
does not meet eligibility requirements with respect to size, HCFA will request a size determination of the organization
from the applicable Small Business Administration (SBA) regional office. The review of the application for scientific
merit may be deferred until a definitive response is furnished by SBA. 
Of particular concern in considering grant awards is the position of principal investigator. We wish to ensure that
support is furnished to a carefully directed working group led by an individual personally committed to the development
of the innovation. Accordingly, we are adopting the ``principal investigator'' concept from 42 CFR part 52. These
regulations define the term ``principal investigator'' to mean ``a single individual designated by the grantee
in the grant application . . . who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the
project.'' (42 CFR 52.2.) In order to meet this standard, the principal investigator's primary employment must be
with the grantee at the time of the award and remain so for the duration of the project. Primary employment means that
more than one-half of the principal investigator's time is spent in the employment of the small business concern.
Primary employment with a small business concern precludes full-time employment at another organization. 
In accordance with SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6144), we have further restricted the definition of primary employment of the principal
investigator to accurately reflect HCFA's needs. The applicant must declare the principal investigator's employment,
whether paid or unpaid, at the time of application, and must declare all employment relationships, whether paid or
unpaid, that the principal investigator is expected to have at the time the SBIR grant awards are expected to be made
and for the duration of the proposed project. In the event that, at the time of application, the principal investigator_(1)
is, or expects to be, a less-than-full-time employee of the small business concern, (2) is, or expects to be, concurrently
employed by another organization, or (3) gives, or expects that he or she may give, the appearance of being concurrently
employed by another organization, whether for a paid or unpaid position, it is essential that documentation be submitted
with the application to verify the applicant's eligibility at the time of the award. Thus, if the principal investigator
is also employed or appears to be employed by an institution other than the applicant organization (for example, a
university, nonprofit research institute, or a company other than the applicant organization), a letter must be
furnished by the nonapplicant organization confirming that the principal investigator, if awarded an SBIR grant,
is, or will become, a less-than-half-time employee of the organization and will remain so for the duration of the SBIR
project. If the principal investigator is employed by a university, the letter must be furnished by the dean of the
school or the departmental chairperson. If the principal investigator is employed by another for-profit organization,
the letter must be signed by a corporate official. This documentation of the primary employment of the principal investigator
is required for every application that is submitted, even one that is a revision of a previously submitted application.
In the event that solicitation of this documentation would place the principal investigator's current employment
in jeopardy should the grant award not be made, the applicant may delay submission of the documentation, provided
the documentation is submitted no later than 30 days after receiving notice of a grant award, and provided that the
applicant includes a statement with the grant application to the effect that solicitation of the documentation at
this time would place the principal investigator's current employment in jeopardy, that the applicant will forward
the documentation within 30 days of receiving notice of a grant award, and that the applicant understands that should
it fail to provide the documentation, we may, at our discretion, immediately suspend or terminate the grant. If the
principal investigator fails to furnish adequate documentation, the application may be returned without review.
In the event a grantee is required to submit documentation of the principal investigator's employment, but fails
to do so within 30 days of the date of the notice of grant award, we may immediately suspend or terminate the grant. 
For both Phase I and Phase II, the research or R&D must be performed in its entirety in the United States (U.S.),
that is, the States, territories, and possessions of the U.S.; the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana
Islands; and the District of Columbia. 


II. Definitions 


The words and phrases that appear on the SBIR application form, or are needed in the application narrative, are not
readily defined. Therefore, for convenience and clarity, we have furnished the following definitions, which, except
as noted, are taken from SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive that implements this program and was published on January
26, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 6144). This policy directive requires an agency to define in a separate section whatever terms it uses that are
unique to either the SBIR Program, a specific SBIR solicitation, or a portion of the solicitation. The section must
also include, at a minimum, specific terms as defined in the policy directive. Accordingly, in addition to the terms
required by the policy directive, we are also defining the terms ``Contract'' and ``Grant'' and including the policy
directive's definition of the term ``Research and Development.'' 


A. Contract 


A ``contract'' is an award instrument establishing a binding legal procurement relationship between a funding agency
and the recipient, obligating the latter to furnish an end product or service and binding the agency to furnish payment
for the product or service. 


B. Grant 


A ``grant'' is a financial assistance mechanism whereby either money or direct assistance, or both, is furnished
to carry out approved activities.

C. Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individual 


A ``socially and economically disadvantaged individual'' 
is defined as a member of any of the following groups: 
 Asian-Pacific Americans. 
 Black Americans. 
 Hispanic Americans. 
 Native Americans. 
 Subcontinent Asian Americans. 


D. Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Small Business 
Concern 


A ``socially and economically disadvantaged'' small 
business concern is one_
 In which at least 51 percent is owned by one or more 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or, in 
the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent 
of the voting stock is owned by one or more socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals; and 
 Whose management and daily business operations are 
controlled by one or more of the individuals. 


E. Research and Development 


``Research and Development'' or R&D is defined as any 
activity that is_
 A systematic, intensive study directed toward greater 
knowledge or understanding of the subject studies; 
 A systematic study directed specifically toward 
applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need; or 
 A systematic application of knowledge toward the 
production of useful materials, devices, and systems or 
methods, including design, development, and improvement of 
prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements. 


F. Small Business Concern 


At the time of award of Phase I and of Phase II, a 
``small business concern'' is one that_
 Is organized for profit, independently owned and 
operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it 
is proposing, and has its principal place of business 
located in the U.S.; 
 Is at least 51 percent owned or, in the case of a 
publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of its voting 
stock is owned by U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted 
permanent resident aliens; and 
 Has, including its affiliates (``affiliation'' is defined 
in 13 CFR 121.401), a number of employees (as defined in 
13 CFR 121.407) not exceeding 500, and meets the other small 
business concern size regulation requirements found in 13 
CFR 121. Business concerns, other than investment companies 
licensed, or State development companies qualifying, under 
the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 661 et 
seq.), are affiliates of one another when either directly or 
indirectly (1) one concern controls or has the power to 
control the other, (2) a third party or parties controls or 
has the power to control both, or (3) an identity of 
interest between or among parties exists so that affiliation 
may be found. Control can be exercised through common 
ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. 
Business concerns include, but are not limited to, any 
individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, 
association, or cooperative. 


G. Subcontract 


A ``subcontract'' is any agreement, other than one 
involving an employer-employee relationship, entered into by 
a Federal government funding agreement awardee calling for 
supplies or services required solely for the performance of 
the original funding agreement. 


H. Women-Owned Small Business Concern 


A ``women-owned small business concern'' is a business 
that is at least 51 percent owned, controlled, and operated 
by a woman or women. ``Control'' is defined as exercising the 
power to make policy decisions; ``operate'' is defined as 
being actively involved in the day-to-day management.

IV. Submission of Grant Applications 


Grant applications must be submitted to the HCFA Grants 
Officer (see the ADDRESSES section of this notice). 
The following schedule applies to the receipt, review, 
and award of SBIR applications:

 

Receipt date_December 9, 1994 
Technical review_January 17, 1995 
Award decisions_February 10, 1995 
Approximate award date_February 17, 1995 


Applications must be received by December 9, 1994. 
Applications mailed through the U.S. Postal Service or a 
commercial delivery service will be ``on time'' if they are 
received or postmarked on or before December 9, 1994. 
Submissions by facsimile (fax) transmission will not be 
accepted. Applications that do not meet the above criteria 
will be considered late applications. Respondents are 
cautioned that if their application is late, it will be 
returned without review. 


V. Method of Selection and Evaluation Criteria 


All Phase I and Phase II grant applications will be 
evaluated and judged on a competitive basis. Applications 
will be screened, and those found to be inadequate for 
review or programmatically unrelated to HCFA's mission will 
be returned to the applicant. Those passing the screening 
will be reviewed for technical and scientific merit. Each 
application will be judged individually, as described in 
this section. HCFA is under no obligation to fund any 
application or make any specific number of awards in a given 
topic area. It may also elect to fund no projects within a 
given topic area. 


A. Review Process 


Grant applications are subject to a review process 
involving two sequential steps. The first step is performed 
by a technical review panel composed primarily of Federal 
and non-Federal professionals selected for their competence 
in particular fields. The task of the panel is to evaluate 
applications for scientific and technical merit. The 
reviewers furnish a number rating, make an overall 
recommendation, and, on occasion, make highly specific 
recommendations related to the scope, direction, and conduct 
of the proposed research. The second level of review is 
made by the senior management of HCFA's ORD. ORD management 
decisions are based on judgments about not only the 
technical merit of the proposed research, but also its 
relevance to our mission. Generally, HCFA may award a grant 
only if the corresponding application has been recommended 
for approval by the panel. However, applications 
recommended for approval are not automatically funded. 


B. Review Criteria 


In considering the scientific and technical merit of 
each application, the following criteria and weights will be 
used: 
 The soundness and technical merit of the proposed 
approach_35 percent. 
 The potential of the research for technological 
innovation including the potential for commercial 
application_30 percent. 
 The qualifications of the proposed principal 
investigator, support staff, and consultant_20 percent. 
 The appropriateness of the budget_10 percent. 
 The adequacy and suitability of the facilities and 
research environment_5 percent. 


C. Funding Decisions 


When making funding decisions, ORD takes into 
consideration the following: (1) ratings resulting from the 
technical evaluation process, (2) program relevance, and 
(3) applications. 


D. Release of Grant Application Review Information 


Following decisions on grant applications, summary 
statements are mailed with a disapproval letter to principal 
investigators whose proposals have not been accepted. 


E. Submission of Similar Grant Applications by the 
Applicant Organization 


HCFA discourages the submission of more than one grant 
application submitted by the same applicant organization 
with essentially the same research focus: That is, a 
product or technology that, with nonsubstantive 
modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. In 
evaluating groupings of applications with a common 
scientific focus or objective, technical review groups are 
in a position to easily identify multiple grant applications 
from the same organization for essentially the same project. 
In these cases, HCFA will give funding consideration to only 
one application. 


VI. Considerations 


SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive (58 FR 6144) 
specifies that we furnish the following information: 


A. Awards 


 There will be approximately 10 to 15 Phase I and/or 
Phase II awards in FY '95. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941003-2-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941003-2-00034 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The SBA Program Policy Directive permits the payment of 
a reasonable fee or profit under the SBIR program. 



B. Reports 



The grantee organization will be required to submit 
short quarterly progress reports, a complete draft final 
report, and a final report. Additionally, a financial 
status report (SF-269A) must be submitted to the HCFA Grants 
Officer annually. The award will specify the schedule for 
these reports and place of delivery. 



C. Payment Schedule 



Once an SBIR grant is awarded, the grantee organization 
will receive information and forms regarding requests for 
cash, manner of payment, and associated reporting 
requirements. Payment may be made on a cost-reimbursement 
or advance basis. Cost reimbursements may be requested 
monthly, quarterly, or at other periodic intervals. Advance 
payments may be requested on a monthly basis only. 



D. Limited Rights Information and Data 



1. Proprietary Information 



Information contained in an unfunded grant application 
will remain the property of the applicant. HCFA may, 
however, retain copies of all applications. 

If proprietary information is provided by a proposer in 
a proposal that constitutes a trade secret, proprietary, 
commercial or financial information, confidential personal 
information or data affecting the national security, it will 
be treated in confidence, to the extent permitted by law, 
provided this information is clearly marked by the proposer 
with the term ``confidential proprietary information'' and 
provided the following legend appears on the title page of 
the proposal: 

For any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, 
this data shall not be disclosed outside the government 
and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in 
whole or in part, provided that if a funding agreement 
is awarded to this proposer as a result of or in 
connection with the submission of this data, the 
government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or 
disclose the data to the extent provided in the funding 
agreement. This restriction does not limit the 
government's right to use information contained in the 
data if it is obtained from another source without 
restriction. The data subject to this restriction are 
contained in pages 

XXX

 of this proposal. 

Any other legend may be unacceptable to the Federal 
government and may constitute grounds for removing the 
proposal from further consideration and without assuming any 
liability for inadvertent disclosure. The government will 
limit dissemination of the information to official channels 
only. 



2. Title to Property 



Title to real property, equipment, and supplies 
acquired by a for-profit recipient under a financial 
assistance award or subaward will vest, upon acquisition, in 
the Federal government. However, the title may be 
transferred to the awardee upon termination of the project 
if the transfer would be more cost-effective than our 
recovery of the property. It is recommended that applicants 
consider leasing arrangements whenever possible. HCFA will 
generally not fund projects that require the acquisition of 
real property, equipment, or supplies. 



3. Rights in Data Developed Under the SBIR Grant 



Rights in data, including software developed under the 
terms of any grant resulting from an application submitted 
in response to this notice will remain with the grantee, 
except that the Federal government will have the limited 
right to use the data for internal Federal government 
purposes. These data will not be released outside the 
Federal government without permission of the grantee for a 
period of 4 years from completion of the project from which 
the data were generated. However, at the end of this 4-year 
period a royalty-free license will exist for HCFA to use, 
and to authorize others to use on its behalf, these data for 
Federal government purposes. At this time, HCFA is also 
relieved of all disclosure prohibitions and assumes no 
liability for unauthorized use of these data by third 
parties. This notice will be affixed to any reproductions 
of these data, in whole or in part. 



4. Copyrights 



With prior written permission of the Grants Officer, 
the awardee may normally copyright and publish (consistent 
with appropriate national security considerations, if any) 
material developed with HCFA's support. HCFA receives a 
royalty-free license for the Federal government and requires 
that each publication contain an appropriate acknowledgment 
of agency support and a disclaimer statement. 



5. Patents 



Small business concerns may normally retain the 
principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed 
with HCFA support. The Federal government receives a 
royalty-free license for Federal government use, reserves 
the right to require the patentholder to license others in 
certain circumstances, and requires that anyone exclusively 
licensed to sell the invention in the U.S. must normally 
manufacture it substantially in the U.S. To the extent 
authorized by 35 U.S.C. 205, the government will not make 
public any information disclosing a government-supported 
invention for a 4-year period to allow the awardee a 
reasonable time to pursue a patent. 



E. Profit or Fee 



Absent a statutory prohibition, payment of a reasonable 
fee or profit will be made under the SBIR program 
(58 FR 6144). Because the regulations set forth at 
45 CFR 74.705, which provide that no profit or fee will be 
furnished to for-profit organizations through grants, do not 
invoke a statutory prohibition on paying a fee or profit, 
the SBA's policy directive applies to these SBIR grants.

F. Joint Ventures and Limited Partnerships 



Joint ventures and limited partnerships are eligible 
provided the entity created qualifies as a small business 
concern in accordance with the definition included in this 
notice. 



G. Performance of Research and Analytical Work by the 
Applicant Organization 



In Phase I, a minimum of two-thirds or 67 percent of 
the research or analytical effort must be carried out by the 
small business concern; that is, consultant fees and 
contracts to a third party for portions of the scientific or 
technical effort may not exceed 33 percent of the total 
proposed budget. 

In Phase II, a minimum of one-half or 50 percent of the 
research or analytical effort must be carried out by the 
small business concern; that is, consultant fees and 
contracts to a third party for portions of the scientific or 
technical effort may not exceed 50 percent of the total 
proposed budget. 



H. Terms and Conditions of Awards 



Upon acceptance of a grant, the awardee must comply 
with the terms and conditions contained or referenced in the 
Notice of Grant Award document. These terms and conditions, 
constituting legal requirements imposed on a grantee by 
statute, regulations, administrative policy, or the award

I. Cost Sharing 


Cost sharing is not required nor will it be an 
evaluation factor in consideration of the proposal. 
However, due to the special nature of the SBIR Program, the 
applicant may choose to share the costs of a project. This 
may be done through cash or in-kind contributions. Most 
frequently, we expect that the applicant will contribute 
more labor or use unreimbursed equipment as the applicant's 
share. 


J. Additional Information 


This 

Federal Register

 notice is intended for 
informational purposes and reflects current planning. If 
there is any inconsistency between the information contained 
in this notice and the terms of any resulting SBIR grant, 
the terms of the grant are controlling. 
Before award of an SBIR grant, HCFA may request the 
applicant to submit certain organization, management, 
personnel, and financial information in order to ensure 
responsibility of the applicant. 
The Federal government is not responsible for any 
monies expended by the applicant before the award of any 
grant. 
This notice is not an offer by HCFA and does not 
obligate HCFA to make any specific number of awards. 
The SBIR Program is not a substitute for HCFA's 
existing unsolicited proposal mechanisms, and unsolicited 
proposals will not be accepted under either Phase I or 
Phase II of the SBIR Program. 
The applicant may be required to certify that he or she 
has not previously been paid, nor is currently being paid, 
for essentially equivalent work by an agency of the Federal 
government. If a grant is made under this notice for a 
project, some of whose elements are being supported, or will 
be supported, by another Federal agency, HCFA and the 
applicant will negotiate a budget that reflects the 
elimination of any overlapping support. 
This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372, 
``Intergovernment Review of Federal Programs.'' Executive 
Order 12372 provides for a State clearinghouse in each State 
to review Federal programs. Research grants are exempt from 
this review. 


VII. Research Topic Areas 


This notice invites SBIR Phase I applications in the 
following areas. The topics are defined in general terms. 
They are intended to indicate where we believe we can 
properly offer assistance in the development of innovative 
technology. ORD will consider any idea that is within the 
general subject of a topic. In addition, ORD will review 
any idea that is within the general purview of HCFA, as 
described in section I. of this notice. Applicants are 
reminded that the overall intent of the HCFA SBIR Program is 
to provide assistance to the development of products and 
processes that have commercial potential and not to the 
acquisition of products for HCFA's own use. 


A. High Quality and Effective Care 


HCFA invites ideas that would develop products to 
assist all participants in health care in assessing and 
monitoring the quality of care and level of care being 
furnished to patients. Projects should aim to develop tools 
for health care professionals, providers, and managers that 
permit them to examine patterns of services being delivered, 
and the health and social outcome of those services. 
Projects that would assist private organizations in 
developing patient guidelines and in conducting technology 
assessments are of interest. These tools should provide a 
way to monitor and measure the delivery of health services 
and the outcomes of those services. They should also make 
possible a judgment about the quality of the care, the 
effectiveness of the care, or both. The technical 
efficiency with which care is delivered and the 
appropriateness of the overall outcome for the patient 
should be addressed. 


B. Management of Ambulatory Services 


HCFA invites ideas that would develop tools to monitor, 
assess, and control overutilization and underutilization of 
ambulatory services and products at all levels of the health 
care system. Apart from the inflation in the cost of each 
service, a significant cause of the rising cost of health 
care services is excessive utilization. Traditionally, 
utilization review techniques have been applied to high 
cost, acute services, such as surgery and hospitalizations. 
We wish to focus on physician services and other ambulatory 
services and products, for example, drugs, medical 
equipment, and testing. HCFA invites applications related 
to services or products commonly associated with Medicare 
beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients, who are primarily the 
aged, the poor, the disabled, and persons with end-stage 
renal disease. Techniques to be explored involve systems 
both for retrospective utilization pattern review and for 
managing prospective interventions in individual physician 
or beneficiary and recipient service or product use. This 
area also includes broader management tools, based on 
information derived from utilization review, that promote or 
ensure more efficient and effective service delivery.

<TEXT>
 

C. Beneficiary Information and Assistance 


HCFA invites ideas that may make the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs understandable to beneficiaries and 
recipients and that provide assistance to these individuals 
in their attempts to deal with the programs. Potential 
program users (Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid 
recipients) need to understand when they are eligible, what 
services or products are covered, and what their rights and 
responsibilities are within each program. An example would 
be an information project that would assist health care 
consumers, including Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid 
recipients, by providing aggregate data on provider 
performance and utilization trends, discrete price 
information, and information on related copayments, etc.; in 
a sense, a ``Blue Book for Consumers.'' Another example is 
obtaining payment for claims, one of the most frequent 
problems encountered by Medicare beneficiaries. The process 
of dealing with Medicare's fiscal intermediaries and 
carriers is difficult for many. Tools that would ease this 
process would be welcome. Beneficiaries also need to be 
able to decide whether they should join, or exit from, a 
health maintenance organization, and the advantages and 
disadvantages of the decision. Beneficiaries need to 
understand what considerations to take into account when 
long term care is a possibility. Similarly, beneficiaries 
need to be assisted in the decision about the purchase of 
health insurance in addition to Medicare. HCFA invites 
ideas in beneficiary communication and assistance approaches 
that are tailored to special populations (such as 
significant demographic, sociocultural, or disease-related 
groups of beneficiaries), as well as approaches that could 
be used by supplemental health benefit program sponsors (for 
example, employers and unions) in assisting Medicare-eligible retirees. Applicants who are considering this 
topic should understand that the SBIR Program generally 
seeks to support the development of commercially viable 
products and that there is already a fair amount of existing 
commercial activity in this area.

D. Program Efficiencies and Improvement 


The existing systems for health care delivery and financing have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, changes
due to new technology, legislation, regulation, and market forces. Major payers for health care are continually
studying the feasibility of new approaches to improving the management of care, the delivery of care, and financing.
Therefore, HCFA invites applications that focus on tools to assist in the goal of improved management of the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. The term management is used in a broad sense. These could be tools that are directed toward providers
who furnish services or products to Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients, organizations that handle the
financing of care, organizations that oversee the quality of services and products, or the beneficiaries and recipients
themselves, and State and local organizations that deal primarily with Medicare and Medicaid populations. 
HCFA will consider any innovative idea that appears to have the potential for improving the programs for any of the
several parties involved, and that has a potential for sale in the normal or commercial market. An example of an innovative
idea is the development of improved computer- based case management systems for community care services. Case management
programs are commonly being used to coordinate community-based care for frail elderly and other populations under
Medicaid and other programs. Automated systems use client eligibility and assessment information to assist case
management agencies in preparing appropriate plans of care based on the client's condition and select service providers.
These systems would also interface with service approval or financial or billing systems to improve the cost-efficiency
of case management programs. Proposed systems should complement or integrate existing mandated HCFA instruments
(particularly functional assessment tools, minimum data sets, discharge planning, etc.). Redundant instruments
will not be considered for funding. 


E. Other Health Care R&D 


We encourage small business concerns to submit applications for proposed research in any area within the field of
health care R&D. 


VIII. Other Required Information 


In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this notice was not reviewed by the Office of Management

<DOCTITLE>Availability and Request for Comment on the Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Revisions </DOCTITLE>


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services has developed and is requesting public
comment on the Draft for Public Review and Comment: 

Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Revisions

. This set of national health objectives was first published in 1990. As the midpoint of the decade approaches, new
science, new data, and new information are available to be incorporated into the nation's prevention agenda. The
revisions take the form of proposed new objectives, new special population subobjectives, changes in language,
and target revisions. The proposals reflect the availability of new information or scientific findings on prevention
and new data indicating disparities in health status among special populations. The proposed revisions are printed
within the context of the Healthy People 2000 objectives published in 1990. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
Background of Health People 2000 


The Public Health Service (

PHS), Department of Health and Human Services, has led a nationwide process to formulate and monitor national disease
prevention and health promotion objectives since 1980. The year 2000 objectives build upon the 1990 objectives effort,
which was initiated in 1979 with the publication of 

Health People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention

, which led to the 1980 publication, 

Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation

. 
The Public Health Service lead agencies for the 22 Healthy People 2000 priority areas have developed the revision
proposals that are now made available for public review and comment. Public comment will be considered by the appropriate
lead agency. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health,
serves as the overall coordinator for the dissemination and processing of the public comments. 
A new PHS report, 

Healthy People 2000 Midcourse Review and Revisions,

 featuring the final revisions and a status report on progress in achieving targets for the year 2000, will be published
in 1995.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-9 and NPF-17, issued to the Duke Power Company,
licensee for the McGuire Nuclear Station Units 1 and 2. The plants are located at the licensee's site in Mecklenburg,
County, North Carolina. The exemption was requested by the licensee by letter dated June 28, 1994, and supplemented
by letters dated August 18, 1994 and September 7, 1994.


Environmental Assessment


Indentification of Proposed Action


The proposed action requests an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 50.60, ``Acceptance Criteria for Fracture
Prevention Measures for Light-Water Nuclear Power Reactors for Normal Operation,'' to allow application of an alternate
methodology to determine the low temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) setpoint for the McGuire Nuclear Station
Units 1 and 2. The proposed alternate methodology is consistent with guidelines developed by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Working Group on Operating Plant Criteria (WGOPC) to define pressure limits during
LTOP events that avoid certain unnecessary operational restrictions, provide adequate margins against failure
of the reactor pressure vessel, and reduce the potential for unnecessary activation of pressure-relieving devices
used for LTOP. These guidelines have been incorporated into Code Case N-514, ``Low Temperature Overpressure
Protection,'' which has been approved by the ASME Code Committee. The content of this code case has been incorporated
into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. The NRC staff is revising
10 CFR 50.55a, which will endorse the 1993 Addenda and Appendix G of Section XI into the regulations.
The philosophy used to develop Code Case N-514 guidelines is to ensure that the LTOP limits are still below the
pressure/temperature (P/T) limits for normal operation, but allow the pressure that may occur with activation of
pressure-relieving devices to exceed the P/T limits, provided acceptable margins are maintained during these events.
This philosophy protects the pressure vessel from LTOP events, and still maintains the Technical Specification
P/T limits applicable for normal heatup and cooldown in accordance with Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50 and Section III
and XI of the ASME Code.


The Need for the Proposed Action


10 CFR 50.60 states that all light-water nuclear power reactors must meet the fracture toughness and material surveillance
program requirements for the reactor coolant pressure boundary as set forth in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50.
Appendix G to 10 CFR 50 defines P/T limits during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational
occurrences and system hydrostatic tests, to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime.
10 CFR 50.60(b) specifies that alternatives to the described requirements in Appendices G and H to 10 CFR Part 50 may
be used when an exemption is granted by the Commission under 10 CFR 50.12

To prevent transients that would produce pressure excursions exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits while the reactor
is operating at low temperatures, the licensee installed an LTOP system. The LTOP system includes pressure relieving
devices in the form of Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) that are set at a pressure low enough that if a transient
occurred while the coolant temperature is below the LTOP enabling temperature, they would prevent the pressure on
the reactor vessel from exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits. To prevent these valves from lifting as a result of normal
operating pressure surges (e.g., reactor coolant pump starting, and shifting operating charging pumps) with the
reactor coolant system in a water solid condition, the operating pressure must be maintained below the PORV setpoint.

In addition, in order to prevent cavitation of a reactor coolant pump, the operator must maintain a differential pressure
across the reactor coolant pump seals. Hence, the licensee must operate the plant in a pressure window that is defined
as the difference between the minimum required pressure to start a reactor coolant pump and the operating margin to
prevent lifting of the PORVs due to normal operating pressure surges. The licensee LTOP analysis indicates that using
the Appendix G safety margins to determine the PORV setpoint would result in a pressure setpoint within its operating
window, but there would be no margin for normal operating pressure surges. Therefore, operating with these limits
could result in the lifting of the PORVs and cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps during normal operation. Therefore,
the licensee proposed that in determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events for McGuire, the allowable pressure be
determined using the safety margins developed in an alternate methodology in lieu of the safety margins required
by Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50. The alternate methodology is consistent with ASME Code Case N-514. The content
of this code case has been incorporated into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda
to Section XI.

An exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 is required to use the alternate methodology for calculating the maximum allowable
pressure for LTOP considerations. By application dated June 28, as supplemented August 18, 1994 (and further clarified
by letter dated September 7, 1994), the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.60.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application.

Appendix G of the ASME Code requires that the P/T limits be calculated: (a) Using a safety factor of 2 on the principal
membrane (pressure) stresses, (b) assuming a flaw at the surface with a depth of one-quarter (1/4) of the vessel wall
thickness and a length of six (6) times its depth, and (c) using a conservative fracture toughness curve that is based
on the lower bound of static, dynamic, and crack arrest fracture toughness tests on material similar to the McGuire
reactor vessel material.

In determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events, the licensee proposed to use safety margins based on an alternate
methodology consistent with the proposed ASME Code Case N-514 guidelines. The ASME Code Case N-514 allows
determination of the setpoint for LTOP events such that the maximum pressure in the vessel would not exceed 110 percent
of the P/T limits of the existing ASME Appendix G. This results in a safety factor of 1.8 on the principal membrane stresses.
All other factors, including assumed flaw size and fracture toughness, remain the same. Although this methodology
would reduce the safety factor on the principal membrane stresses, use of the proposed criteria will provide adequate
margins of safety to the reactor vessel during LTOP transients.
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed change involves use of more realistic safety margins
for determining the PORV setpoint during LTOP events. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements
related to operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, dated April 1976, and its addendum dated January 1981.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the state of Tennessee regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
state official had no comments.



Finding of no Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated June 28, as supplemented August
18, 1994 (and further clarified by letter dated September 7, 1994), which is available for public inspection at the
Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC and at the local public document room located
at the Atkins Library, University of North Carolina, Charlotte (UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223.

<DOCTITLE>North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation, et al.; Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering amending Facility Operating License No.
NPF-86 issued to North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (North Atlantic) for the Seabrook Station, Unit
No. 1 (Seabrook). The facility is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The proposed action would amend the Seabrook Technical Specifications (TS) to permit operation of the Seabrook core
with an expanded axial flux difference (AFD) band from that currently permitted. Operation with the expanded AFD
band would be supported by continuous monitoring of core power distribution using the fixed incore detector system.
Other TS changes would allow for fuel design enhancements. The changes to the TS include modification to a number of
safety analysis input parameters and assumptions as follows:

 Incorporation of Westinghouse WRB-1 departure from nucleate boiling correlation and revised thermal
design procedure.

 Increased core power distribution peaking factors.

 Allowance for positive moderator temperature coefficient.

 Allowance for thimble plug deletion.

 Allowance for increased steam generator tube plugging limit.

 Allowance for new fuel design features.

 Modification of analytical assumptions related to certain surveillance parameters.

 Expansion of AFD band Limiting Condition for Operation.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed changes will allow operation of Seabrook with improved fuel cycle management and will permit North Atlantic
to implement certain new fuel design features in the future.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed action will allow for a significant improvement in fuel utilization. The number of fuel assemblies required
for an equilibrium core reload will decrease from 80 to 72. Thus, the major environmental effects of the proposed action
are:

a. Less nuclear fuel will be required for the reactor core thereby reducing the environmental impacts associated
with mining, converting, enriching, and transporting uranium,

b. Fewer fuel assemblies will be required for the reactor core reloads thereby reducing the environmental impacts
associated with fabricating and transporting fuel assemblies,

c. Fewer spent fuel assemblies will be produced reducing the amount of spent fuel storage space required, and

d. Fewer spent fuel assemblies will need to be managed in long-term storage or disposed of in licensed repositories.

The Commission has evaluated the environmental impact of the proposed action and has determined that neither the
probability of accidents nor the post-accident radiological releases would be great than previously determined.
Further, the Commission has determined that the proposed approval would not affect routine radiological plant effluents
and would not increase occupational radiological exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are
no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed approval does involve features located entirely
within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant, any
alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested approval. This would not reduce the environmental impact
attributable to the facility.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
Related to Operation of the Seabrook Station, Units 1 and 2, dated December 1974.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and discussed the proposed issuance with the New Hampshire
and Massachusetts State officials. The State officials had no comments. The Commission did not consult other agencies
or persons.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to this action, see the request for approval dated November 23, 1993, as clarified
and supplemented by letter dated August 15, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public
Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room located
at the Exeter Public Library, 47 Front Street, Exeter, New Hampshire 03833.

<DOCTITLE>The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company,
Pennsylvania Power Company, and, Toledo Edison Company; Exemption </DOCTITLE>



I 



The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company,
Pennsylvania Power Company, and, Toledo Edison Company (the licensees) hold Facility Operating License No. NPF-58,
which authorizes operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant (PNPP), Unit No. 1. The license provides, among other
things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the
Commission) now or hereafter in effect. This facility is a boiling water reactor located on the shore of Lake Erie in
Lake County, Ohio, approximately 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, and approximately 23 miles southwest of
Ashtabula, Ohio. 



II 



Subsection (a) of 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality Accident Requirements,'' requires that each licensee authorized
to possess special nuclear material shall maintain in each area where such material is handled, used, or stored, an
appropriate criticality monitoring system. In accordance with Subsection (a)(1) of 10 CFR 70.24, coverage of all
such areas at PNPP, Unit No. 1, shall be provided by two criticality detectors. However, exemptions may be requested
pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24(d), provided that the licensee believes that good cause exists for the exemption. In particular,
Regulatory Guide 8.12, Revision 2, ``Criticality Accident Alarm System,'' states that it is appropriate to request
an exemption from 10 CFR 70.24 if an evaluation determines that a potential for criticality does not exist, as for example
where geometric spacing is used to preclude criticality. 

By letter dated February 28, 1992, the license requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24. A previous
exemption from the provisions of 10 CFR 70.24 for the storage of special nuclear material, including reactor fuel
assemblies (maximum amount of 2,602 kg of U-235 in uranium enriched to no more than 3.00 weight percent (w/o)),
was granted to PNPP in NRC Material License No. SNM-1928. The materials license was issued on March 7, 1985, and
expired upon conversion of the construction permit to an operating license on November 13, 1986. The bases for the
current exemption request is the same as for the original 1985 request. Specifically, the licensees proposed to handle
and store unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building in the new fuel pool without having a criticality monitoring
system with two separate criticality detectors as required by 10 CFR 70.24. 

The bases for the exemption is that the potential for accident critically is precluded because of the geometric spacing
of fuel in the storage pool and administrative controls imposed in fuel handling procedures from the time the fuel
is removed from approved shipping containers, until it is placed in specially designed storage racks. Administrative
control encompass placing the assemblies in the fuel inspection stand, receipt inspection activities, and lifting
and placement of the assemblies into specified locations into the new fuel storage vaults. Design of the new fuel racks
precludes criticality, i.e., an effective multiplication factor of 0.95 or less in the normal dry condition or abnormal
completely water flooded condition. Criticality during optimal moderation (foam, small droplets, spray, or fogging)
is precluded by storing new fuel assemblies in the new fuel vaults in alternate rows and columns. Administrative controls
will prevent placement of each fuel assembly in adjacent storage cells. Restrictions on this exemption ensure that
personnel are trained, equipment is operable, an assembly storage plan is developed, reviewed, and approved, and
verification is undertaken by the Reactor Engineer or licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the completion of each
fuel assembly transfer to ensure criticality is precluded. These restrictions are listed in the enclosure as items
1, 2, 3, and 4. Restriction 5 requires performing and maintaining criticality analyses documenting that the maximum
effective multiplication factor for each fuel assembly does not exceed 0.95 when optimally moderated and fully reflected
by water. Restriction 6 limits maximum fuel enrichment to 5 w/o of U-235 independent of the results of analyses
performed in accordance with Restriction 5. Fuel assemblies, when stored in their shipping containers, shall be
stacked no more than three containers high (Restriction 7). No more than three fuel assemblies shall be outside their
shipping containers or storage racks at any one time (Restriction 8). The minimum edge-to-edge distance between
the group of three fuel assemblies and all other fuel assemblies shall be 12 inches (Restriction 9). 

Based upon the information provided, there is reasonable assurance that unirradiated fuel will remain subcritical
because of the new fuel pool design and administrative controls. The special circumstances for granting an exemption
to 10 CFR 70.24 are met because criticality is precluded with the present design configuration, Technical Specification
requirements, and the restrictions placed upon the exemption. Therefore, the staff concludes that the licensee's
request for an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 70.24 for unirradiated fuel in the fuel handling building
is acceptable and should be granted. This exemption is subject to the restrictions listed in the enclosure. 



III 



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 70.24, an exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. 

Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described in Section II above from 10 CFR 70.24, ``Criticality
Accident Requirements,'' such that the licensee is exempt from providing two criticality detectors. This exemption
is subjection to the restrictions in the enclosure. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 47363). 



This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 15, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published changes to four existing system notices (59 FR

(Presidential Management Intern Program Records) by that publication allowed disclosure of names and home address
of participants and alumni of the programs to other program participants and alumni.



It has been determined that the Federal Executive Institute already obtains consent for disclosure directly from
the individuals involved, and the Presidential Management Intern program will establish a similar procedure for
release of such data. Therefore, routine uses to cover disclosure of the information are not necessary, and routine
use ``m'' added to OPM/Central-10 and routine use ``n'' added to OPM/Central-11 are hereby rescinded.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Storage of Customer Account Records


September 23, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


Currently, paragraph (c) of CBOE Rule 9.8, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' provides that background and financial
information of customers who have been approved for options transactions must be maintained at both the branch office
servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office.
In addition, copies of options customer account statements over the most recent six months must be maintained at both
the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch.
The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 9.8(c) and Interpretation and Policy .03 to enable members' supervisory offices
to maintain certain customer account information at off-site locations as long as the records are readily accessible
and promptly retrievable.
The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to enable supervisory offices of CBOE members to store certain customer
account records off-site. CBOE members that elect to do so must ensure that the records are easily accessible and promptly
retrievable.
Currently, under CBOE Rule 9.8, background and financial information about customers, as well as copies of customer
account statements, must be maintained at the branch office serving the customer and at that branch's principal supervisory
office. The substance of this rule appears uniformly in the rules of the other options exchanges and in the options
account rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). According to the CBOE, on-site
storage in major financial centers is expensive, and, in today's market environment, automated and secure facilities
for data storage and retrieval make it unnecessary to require on-site storage. The CBOE states that, given those realities,
the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
 has recommended that record retention requirements be relaxed and that the exchanges and the NASD amend their rules
to permit supervisory offices to store customer records off-premises as a matter of routine practice.






The CBOE concurs with the OSRC's recommendation and believes that its proposal will afford the CBOE's members the
opportunity to discharge their supervisory responsibilities more efficiently and more cost-effectively. Accordingly,
the CBOE's proposal amends paragraph (c) and Interpretation and Policy .03 of CBOE Rule 9.8 to enable CBOE members'
supervisory offices to use off-premises storage for certain of the customer records specified in the rules, provided
the records are easily accessible and promptly retrievable.





The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:




(a) by order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by October 24, 1994. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Extension of the Lead Market Maker System Pilot Program </DOCTITLE>



September 23, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 9, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



Commentary .01 to PSE Rule 6.82, ``Lead Market Maker Pilot Program,'' states that the PSE's Lead Market Maker (``LMM'')
system pilot program will expire on September 30, 1994. The PSE proposes to amend Commentary .01 to extend the Exchange's
LMM system pilot program through September 30, 1995.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the PSE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) 

Purpose.



On January 17, 1990, the Commission approved the PSE's LMM system on a pilot basis.
 Previously, the Commission has approved Exchange requests for extension of the pilot program,
 which is set to expire on September 30, 1994.
 The PSE submitted pilot program reports to the Commission on September 18, 1992, and on July 26, 1993. In addition,
on April 20, 1994, the Exchange withdrew several pending rule filings relating to the LMM program and did so with the
intention of resubmitting a consolidated filing at a later date.
 At this time, the PSE is considering additional rule changes to be included in the consolidated filing. Therefore,
the Exchange proposes to amend its rules to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, in order to provide
additional time for evaluation of the LMM program in light of any changes that may be approved within the next year.









(b) 

Basis

. 

The PSE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade and
contribute to the protection of investors and the public interest. 



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others. 



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited or received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The PSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act. 

The Commission finds that the proposal to extend the LMM pilot program through September 30, 1995, is consistent with
the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6.
 The Commission concludes, as it did in approving the LMM pilot program, that the pilot program may enhance the market
making mechanism on the PSE, thereby improving the markets for listed options on the Exchange. Specifically, the
Commission believes that the LMM pilot may improve the PSE's market making capabilities by creating long-term commitments
to options classes. Moreover, the pilot program will continue with adequate due process safeguards in the LMM selection
and termination procedures and will retain procedures that prevent the misuse of material non-public LMM information
by either an LMM or a broker-dealer affiliated with an LMM. The Commission notes, however, that before the pilot program
can be approved on a permanent basis, the PSE must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of the pilot
program. 






Specifically, before requesting permanent approval or further extension of the pilot program the PSE must submit
a pilot program report by June 1995 that addresses: (1) whether there have been any complaints regarding the operation
of the pilot; (2) whether the PSE has taken any disciplinary or performance action against any member due to the operation
of the pilot; (3) the number of LMMs involved in the pilot; (4) the extent to which the pilot has been used on the PSE; (5)
whether the PSE has terminated or replaced an LMM and the reasons therefore; (6) the impact of the pilot on the bid/ask
spreads, depth and continuity in PSE options markets; and (7) whether the PSE has taken any action or there have been
any complaints against LMMs or associated broker-dealers relating to improper activity as a result of LMM affiliations
with upstairs firms. 

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 because the PSE has not indicated that there have been any problems associated with the operation of the LMM system
pilot program and because the Commission has not received any adverse comments concerning the pilot program. In addition,
the Commission believes good cause exists to approve the extension of the LMM pilot program on an accelerated basis
in order to allow the pilot program to continue uninterrupted. The Commission believes, therefore, that granting
accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with Section 6 of the Act.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment No. 3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Modifications
of the Position and Exercise Limits for Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>



September 23, 1994.



On March 29, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend PHLX Rules 1001, ``Position Limits'', and 1002,'' ``Exercise Limits,''
 to increase the position and exercise limits for foreign currency options (``FCOs'') from 100,000 contracts to 150,000
contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts, based on the previous year's trading
volume.

Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on August 18, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposal. 





Currently, PHLX Rule 1001 establishes a position limit of 100,000 contracts for FCOs traded on the PHLX. The PHLX proposes
to amend Exchange Rules 1001 and 1002 to increase the position and exercise limits for FCOs, including cross-rate
FCOs.
 Specifically, under proposed Commentary .05(b) to PHLX rule 1001, the PHLX proposes to establish a position limit
of 150,000 contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts, based upon the previous
year's volume. At the beginning of each calendar year, the PHLX will review FCO volume information from the previous
year to determine which limit will apply; a higher limit will be effective on the date set by the Exchange, and a lower
limit will take effect on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration. If the PHLX's beginning-of-the-year
FCO trading volume review indicates that the position limit for an FCO must be lowered from 150,000 contracts to 100,000
contracts, the PHLX will promptly notify FCO participants that the lower limit will be effective for all series in
that option on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration, and FCO participants will be required to comply
with the lower limit.
 In addition, the PHLX's Market Surveillance Department plans to monitor trading volume on a monthly basis, so that
FCOs will be eligible immediately for a higher position limit when annual trading volume, as measured from the beginning
of the calendar year, exceeds the levels established in the proposal. 






In order to implement the proposal prior to the end of 1994, the PHLX plans to conduct a one-time review of FCO volume,
calculating volume for the 12-month period immediately preceding approval of the proposal, so that FCOs with annual
trading volume during that period of at least 3,500,000 contracts will be eligible for the 150,000-contract limit
immediately after approval of the proposal.
 The PHLX states that for the 12-month period from September 1993-August 1994, the Deutsche mark and the French
franc would qualify for the higher limit.
 






The PHLX notes that the Exchange's exercise limits are established by reference to position limits, so that any increase
in position limits will also increase exercise limits. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1002
to reflect the proposed amendment to Exchange Rule 1001. 

The Exchange views the current FCO position and exercise limits as too low in light of increased levels of trading activity
in the underlying currency markets and the resultant growth in liquidity of PHLX FCOs in recent years. The PHLX's proposal
is designed to identify and accommodate those active currencies where heavier trading and open interest warrant
higher limits. The PHLX understands that if it were to begin trading a new currency, measurement of the new currency's
trading volume for purposes of establishing its eligibility for the 150,000-contract limit would be calculated
from the beginning of the ``calendar year.'' 

When FCOs began trading on the PHLX in 1982, FCO position limits were set at 10,000 contracts.
 Since that time the position limits have been changed three times, including an increase to the current level of 100,000
contracts in 1986.
 Since 1986, the PHLX has added several new products for which position limits are aggregated with other trading in
the same underlying foreign currency.
 As a result, many traders have begun to regularly accumulate positions near existing limits, especially in certain
more active currencies. In those active currencies, the PHLX believes that trading interest could migrate to the
over-the-counter (``OTC'') market, hampering PHLX liquidity if large traders continue to be restricted by the current
position limits.

The PHLX notes that since the time of the most recent increase in position limits, the size of the underlying currency
market has grown exponentially.
 Since 1986, average daily trading volume in PHLX FCOs has grown from 30,880 to 48,246 contracts in 1992.
 As of February 1993, average daily volume was 61,062 contracts. Monthly volume and open interest have also increased
dramatically since 1986, especially in certain FCOs. Further, the highest monthly open interest in FCOs reached
995,941 in 1986; 1,188,570 contracts in 1987; 1,190,389 contracts in 1992; and 1,338,458 in 1993. Total annual volume
has increased from 7,905,239 contracts in 1986 to 12,158,069 contracts in 1992 to 13,101,365 contracts in 1993. Total
FCO trading volume as of July 1994 was 5,755,939 contracts.






In light of these market changes, the PHLX believes that increased position and exercise limits are necessary to add
depth and liquidity to the market. Because of the large size of the underlying market in foreign currencies, the PHLX
does not believe that higher position and exercise limits will increase manipulative concerns. Moreover, the Exchange
believes that these increases are particularly appropriate because the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional
and corporate investors who have substantial hedging needs and execute block-sized
 transactions in FCOs.





Although the Exchange may grant position limit exemptions in the interest of fair and orderly markets, the Exchange
believes that it is more direct and logical to establish more appropriate position limits for all investors.

The PHLX believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade as well as to protect
investors and the public interest. The PHLX believes that the increased depth and liquidity of the FCO market should
promote just and equitable principles of trade. In addition, the PHLX believes that the proposed approach to FCO position
limits should ensure that the applicable limit is reasonably related to trading volume. The PHLX believes that this,
in turn, should result in position limit levels that serve the purposes of protecting investors and the public interest
as well as preventing unfair acts and practices, such as manipulation.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to raise the position limit for only those FCOs with annual
trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts should help to accommodate the needs of investors and market participants
while ensuring that the increased limits are only available for those currencies with extremely large and liquid
markets.





In this regard, the Commission believes, as it has stated in the past, that although position and exercise limits for
FCOs must be sufficient to protect the options and related markets from disruptions by manipulation, the limits must
not be established at levels that are so low as to discourage participation in the options market by institutions and
other investors with substantial hedging needs or to prevent market makers from adequately meeting their obligations
to maintain a fair and orderly market.
 In its proposal, the PHLX states that the FCO market attracts a large number of institutional and corporate investors
who have substantial needs and who execute block-sized transactions in FCOs. In addition, the PHLX believes that
trading in active currencies could migrate to the OTC market if traders continue to be restricted by the PHLX's current
FCO position limits. In light of the size of the FCO market and the needs of FCO investors and market makers, the Commission
believes that the PHLX's proposal is a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of market participants and to help
the Exchange remain competitive with the OTC market for FCOs.

At the same time, the Commission does not believe that the proposal significantly increases concerns regarding intermarket
manipulations or disruptions of the markets for FCOs or the underlying currencies. The Commission notes that the
interbank foreign currency spot market is an extremely large, diverse market comprised of banks and other financial
institutions worldwide.
 That market is supplemented by equally deep and liquid markets for standardized options and futures on foreign currencies
and options on those futures. An active OTC market also exists in FCOs. Given the probable expense of attempting to
affect the cash market for the currencies underlying the FCOs, the Commission believes that it would be difficult
for a market participant to manipulate the underlying cash market to benefit a previously established FCO position.





In addition, the Commission believes the proposal's requirement that FCOs have annual trading volume of 3,500,000
contracts to be eligible for the 150,000 contract limit further minimizes the potential for manipulations and helps
to ensure that only consistently active currencies will be eligible for the higher position limit. In this regard,
the Commission notes that if the PHLX's annual review of FCO trading volume indicates that an FCO is no longer eligible
for the higher position limit, then the lower limit will be effective in all series of the FCO effective the Monday following
the mid-month June expiration.






The Commission believes that the proposal's two-tiered approach to FCO position limits is consistent with the three-tiered
position limits for equity and narrow-based index options traded on the PHLX, and that tiering is consistent with
the evolutionary approach that the Commission and the options exchanges have adopted in increasing position and
exercise limits.
 The Commission believes that the PHLX has had considerable experience monitoring the tiered framework in equity
options and narrow-based index options, and that differing position limits in those options have not created programming
or monitoring problems for securities firms, or led to significant customer confusion.
 Based on the PHLX's experience with the three-tiered approach in equity and narrow-based index options, the Commission
believes the two-tiered approach for FCOs is appropriate.






Moreover, the absence of discernible manipulative problems under the current FCO position limit leads the Commission
to conclude that the proposed increase is warranted. The Commission recognizes, as it has stated in the past, that
there are no ideal limits in the sense that options positions of any given size can be stated conclusively to be free
of any manipulative concerns.
 The PHLX and the Commission, however, have relied largely on the absence of discernible manipulation or disruption
problems under the current limit as an indicator that additional increases can be safely considered. The Commission
believes for these reasons that the liberalization of existing FCO position and exercise limits under the condition
specified is appropriate.







In addition, the Commission believes that the PHLX's surveillance programs will be adequate to detect and deter the
use of illegal position limits by market participants as well as detect and deter attempted manipulative activity
and other trading abuses.

The Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX, on a timely basis, to review annual FCO volume during the
year measured immediately prior to approval of the proposal in order to allow the Exchange to implement the higher
position limit for eligible FCOs prior to the end of 1994.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

.

The Commission believes that Amendment No. 3 strengthens the PHLX's proposal by requiring that lower position limits
be implemented sooner than originally proposed, 

i.e.

, six months rather than up to two years, if an FCO's trading volume for the previous year is less than 3,500,000 contracts,
thereby helping to ensure that only actively traded currencies are eligible for the higher position limit. Accordingly,
the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 3 to the
proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed
Rule Change, and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 4 to the Proposed Rule Change,
by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Amending Options Floor Procedure Advice A-2 and Rule 1066</DOCTITLE>


September 26, 1994.


On February 26, 1992, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Phlx Options Floor Procedure Advice (``OFPA'') A-2 and Phlx Rule 1066. The Exchange
filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on January 6, 1993,
 Amendment No. 2 on June 19, 1993,
 Amendment No. 3 on June 23, 1994,
 Amendment No. 4 on September 21, 1994.











The proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 thereto were published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule changes, nor the amendments. This order approves the proposal and the
floor amendments.





The proposed rule change to existing OFPA A-2 relates to the acceptance of contingency orders by Exchange specialists
(``Specialists''). The changes to part (ii), and the addition of part (iii), of OFPA A-2 would permit Specialists
to accept contingency orders currently forwarded through the Automated Options Market System (also known as ``AUTOM'')
without the requirement of approval by an Exchange floor official (``Floor Official''). Such contingency orders
would include those currently listed and defined in paragraph (c) of Phlx Rule 1066,
 as well as additional types of contingency orders that the Exchange is proposing to add to Rule 1066(c). In addition,
the Exchange is proposing to make changes to the fine schedule of OFPA A-2.





Curently, a Specialist is prohibited under OFPA A-2 from accepting contingency orders, other than stop (stop-loss)
and stop-limit orders, without the express approval of a Floor Official.
 The proposed changes would make permissible the acceptance of contingency orders by Specialists without the approval
of a Floor Official. The change would extend the acceptance of certain contingency orders without floor official
approval beyond the currently permitted acceptance of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders to include contingency
orders as defined as such in Rule 1066(c), and will apply to both customer and broker-dealer accounts. Furthermore,
a Specialist would be able to refuse to accept contingency orders, but may only refuse to accept contingency orders
from customer accounts upon the prior approval of two Floor Officials.





The Exchange is proposing to clarify the existing definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders in Phlx Rule
1066, and to add new subparagraphs (c)(4)-(7) to Rule 1066. This new text would expand the existing list of the
types of contingency orders and define each contingency order permitted. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to
add all-or-none,
 opening-only-market,
 market-on-close,
 and cancel-replacement orders.









Finally, the Exchange is proposing to amend the fine schedule to OFPA A-2 to increase the penalties for infractions
of those guidelines by Specialists.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission finds the amendment to OFPA A-2 permitting Specialists to accept contingency
orders, as defined in Phlx Rule 1066, without prior Floor Official approval, will remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by facilitating quicker and more efficient executions
of such contingency orders. While the Commission believes that it is permissible for Specialists to retain the ability
to refuse to accept contingency orders as market conditions necessitate, the Commission also believes that the proposed
amendment to OFPA A-2 requiring the express approval of two Floor Officials in order for a Specialist to refuse
to accept a contingency order from a customer account will serve to prevent Specialists from arbitrarily rejecting
such customer orders, and will thereby help to protect investors and the public interest. In this regard, the Commission
would expect the Phlx to monitor this area to assure that orders are not arbitrarily or unfairly being refused.





The Commission finds that the expansion of Phlx Rule 1066(c) to include four additional types of contingency orders
is consistent with the Act and the rules thereunder, as well as the rules of other self-regulatory organizations which
trade option products. Specifically, the definitions of all-or-none,
 opening-only-market,
 and market-on-close
 orders are consistent with the definitions contained in the rules of other options self-regulatory organizations,
all of which rules have been previously approved by the Commission. In addition, although not contained in the rules
of other self-regulatory organizations, the ability, or in some cases the responsibility, of Exchange members to
submit cancel-replacement orders in appropriate circumstances is set forth in Phlx OFPA A-7(b), which was
previously approved by the Commission.









The Commission also finds that the proposed amendments to the definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders
in Rule 1066(c) merely clarify the current definitions of those terms, and therefore present no new regulatory issues.

The Commission also finds that the amendment to OFPA A-2's fine schedule to increase the penalties for infractions
thereof will continue to provide a fair and effective means to enforce compliance with the provisions and thereby
promote just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors and the public interest.

Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register. 

Currently, OFPA A-2(ii) permits specialists to accept spread, straddle, or combination orders, as those terms
are defined in Phlx Rule 1066(d), (g) and (h), respectively with the express approval of one Floor Official. However,
because such orders are discretionary in nature, and Section 11(a) of the Act
 prohibits specialists from accepting discretionary orders, the Phlx has amended OFPA A-2 to prohibit specialists
from accepting such orders, regardless of Floor Official approval. Thus, the purpose of Amendment No. 4 is merely
to conform OFPA A-2 with the requirements and prohibitions of the Act, and necessarily serves to promote just
and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission finds
that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 4. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent
with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 4 on an accelerated basis.





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing also will be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory orgainzation. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-92-03, and should be submitted by October 24, 1994.



It is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-92-03), as amended, is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>ACM Institutional Reserves, Inc.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



September 26, 1994.



Agency: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').




Action: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





Applicant: 

ACM Institutional Reserves, Inc. (``ACM'').




Relevant Act Sections: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from rule 24f-2 under the Act.




Summary of Application: 

ACM requests an order to permit it to pay a share registration fee due under rule 24f-2 for its fiscal year ending
April 30, 1994 based on net sales, 

i.e., 

new sales minus redemptions, rather than on gross sales, 

i.e., 

with no credit for redemptions.

The application was filed on August 19, 1994.




Hearing or Notification of Hearing: 

An order granting the application will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested parties may request a
hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary and serving applicant with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing

on applicant, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Hearing requests should state
the nature of the writer's interest, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons may request notification
of a hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary.




Addresses: 

Secretary, SEC, 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Applicant, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10105.




For Further Information Contact: 

Fran Pollack-Matz, Senior Attorney, at (202) 942-0570, or Robert A. Robertson, Branch Chief, at (202) 942-0564
(Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).




Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Applicant, a registered open-end investment company, has filed a declaration pursuant to rule 24f-2 under
the Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933.

2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f-2 must file annual notices with the SEC and
pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f-2 notice is filed within
two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net
sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f-2 notice is not filed within two months,
the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f-2 notice
along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's
fiscal year.

3. ACM's fiscal year ends on April 30. ACM submitted the rule 24f-2 notice for the fiscal year ending April 30,
1994 to a same day courier service on June 30, 1994, the last day of the two month filing deadline. Because ACM had net
sales during the fiscal year, the notice was accompanied by $25,031.59, the fee payable to register the shares sold
by ACM in excess of redemptions. The filing arrived at the SEC's filing desk after 5:30 p.m. on June 30, 1994, and was
then made on July 1, 1994, but was rejected as having been filed too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on
net sales. Thus, absent relief, applicant owes registration fees based on gross sales. For the fiscal year ending
April 30, 1994, this would amount to an additional $573,733.41.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and
to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, the SEC must find
that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing deadline of rule 24f-2.






2. ACM believes that it made a good faith effort to file the rule 24f-2 notice on a timely basis by same-day courier.
ACM states that the delay in receipt of its filing was caused by an extraordinary series of delays precipitated by the
same-day courier service.

3. ACM believes that the requested relief meets the section 6(c) standards. Thus, ACM requests an exemption under
section 6(c) from rule 24f-2 to permit them to pay registration fees based on net sales.

Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 



Applicants' Representations 



1. Each existing Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and advised by the Adviser. The Open-End Trusts
are registered open-end management investment companies, and the Closed-End Trusts are registered closed-end
management investment companies. The Colonial Investment Services division (the ``Distributor'') of the Adviser
serves as the principal underwriter of the Open-End Trusts. Certain of the existing Trusts offer multiple series
of shares. The term ``Fund'' refers to any series of a Trust, if the Trust offers shares in multiple series, or to a Trust
that offers shares only in one series. 

2. The board of trustees
 of each Fund currently consists of nine persons, eight of whom are not ``affiliated persons'' of the Adviser or the
Distributor within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Only the trustees who are not affiliated persons of the
Adviser or the Distributor (the ``Eligible Trustees'') are entitled to receive annual fees for their services. The
aggregate annual fees are, and are expected to remain, insignificant in comparison to applicants' total net assets.
 






3. Applicants request relief to permit the Eligible Trustees to elect to defer receipt of all or part of their trustees'
fees pursuant to a deferred fee agreement (the ``Agreement'') entered into between each Eligible Trustee and appropriate
Fund. Under the Agreement, the Eligible Trustees could defer payment of trustees' fees to defer payment of income
taxes or for other reasons. 

4. Under the Agreement, the deferred fees payable by a Fund to a particular Eligible Trustee will be credited to a book
reserve account established by the Fund (the ``Deferred Fee Account''), as of the date such fees would have been paid
to the Eligible Trustee. Trustees' fees payable for attending board meetings or board committee meetings will be
credited to the Deferred Fee Account on the following business day. The value of a Deferred Fee Account shall equal
the value such account would have had if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested in certain
designated securities (``Underlying Securities'') as of the date credited. Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited
or charged with book adjustments reflecting all dividends, including interest income and capital gains, and all
unrealized gains and losses that would have been earned had the account been investing in such Underlying Securities.


5. The Underlying Securities will be shares of Funds as agreed to between the applicable board of trustees and the participating
trustee. Although a Fund's own shares may serve as an Underlying Security, applicants do not anticipate that a Fund
will purchase its own shares. Rather, monies equal to the amount credited to the Deferred Fee Account will be invested
along with and in the same securities and proportions as the rest of the Fund's assets. Under existing deferral agreements,
certain trustees have deferred receipt of their compensation under an arrangement where the trustee is entitled
to receive an amount equal to the value such deferred compensation would have had if it had been invested in U.S. Treasury
Bills on the date upon which such compensation otherwise would have been paid to such trustee.
 





6. The obligations of a Fund to make payments to the Deferred Fee Accounts will be general unsecured obligations of
the Fund, and payments made pursuant to the Agreement will be made from the Fund's general assets and property. As a
matter of risk management, each Fund intends and, with respect to any money market Fund that values its assets by the
amortized cost method, undertakes, to purchase and maintain the Underlying Securities in amounts equal to the deemed
investment of the Deferred Fee Accounts of its trustees. If a Fund chooses to purchase Underlying Securities to cover
its obligations under the Agreement, any and all such Underlying Securities will continue to be a part of the general
assets and property of the Fund. Any purchase of Underlying Securities will be made for the benefit of shareholders
generally and not for the Eligible Trustees. 

7. Under the Agreement, an Eligible Trustee may elect to defer payment of all or part of his or her trustee's fees until
(a) The trustee ceases to be a trustee of the Fund, (b) the trustee dies, (c) the dissolution, liquidation, or winding
up of the Fund, or the disposition of all of or substantially all of the Fund's assets (unless the Fund's obligations
under the Agreement have been assumed by a financially responsible party purchasing such assets), or (d) the merger
or consolidation of the Fund (unless, prior to such merger or consolidation, the board of trustees determines that
the Agreement shall survive the merger or consolidation).
 Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in a number of annual installments, not to exceed ten, elected by the trustee at
the time of entering into the Agreement. Each annual payment will be made as of January 31. The trustee's right to receive
payments will be nontransferable, except that, in the event of a trustee's death, amounts payable to him or her thereafter
will be payable to his or her designated beneficiary.

8. The Agreement will not obligate a Fund to retain the services of a trustee, nor will it obligate a Fund to pay any particular
level of fees to any trustee. The proposed arrangements will not affect the voting rights of any of the Funds' shareholders.
If a Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by another Fund, the purchasing Fund will vote such shares in proportion
to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants believe that the deferred fee arrangements are in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders,
and that the arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain high caliber trustees.

2. Sections 18(a) and 18(c) restrict the ability of a registered closed-end investment company to issue senior securities.
Similarly, section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior
securities. Section 13(a)(2) requires that any registered investment company obtain shareholder authorization
before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy in its registration statement. Applicants
contend that the Agreement possesses none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact
these sections. The Agreement would not: (a) Induce speculative investments or provide opportunities for manipulative
allocation of the expenses and profits of a Fund; (b) affect control of a Fund; (c) confuse investors or convey a false
impression of safety; or (d) be inconsistent with the theory of mutuality of risk. All liabilities for deferred fees
are expected to be offset by essentially equal amounts of assets that would not otherwise exist if the fees were paid
on a current basis.

3. Section 22(f) prohibits undisclosed restrictions on transferability or negotiability of redeemable securities
issued by open-end investment companies. Applicants contend that any restrictions created under the Agreement
clearly would be set forth in the Agreement, are included primarily to benefit the Eligible Trustees, and would not
adversely affect the interests of any shareholder of any Fund.

4. Sections 22(g) and 23(a) generally prohibit a registered open-end and closed-end investment company, respectively,
from issuing any of their securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. Applicants assert
that, while a trustee would receive fees for services, such fees would be payable independent of the Agreement. The
Agreement would merely provide for deferral of payment of such fees and thus should be viewed as being issued not in
return for services but in return for a Trust not being required to pay such fees on a current basis. Applicant further
assert that these sections primarily are concerned with the dilutive effect on the equity and voting power than can
result when securities are issued for consideration that is not readily valued. Applicants submit that the Agreement
would not have such effect.

5. Rule 2a-7 imposes certain restrictions on the investments of ``money market funds,'' as defined under the
rule, that would prohibit a Fund that is a money market fund from investing in the shares of any other Fund. Applicants
submit that the requested exemption would permit the Funds in question to achieve an exact matching of Underlying
Securities with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred fees would
not affect net asset value. Applicants further assert that the amounts involved in all cases would be 

de minimis 

in relation to the total net assets of each Fund, and would have no effect on the per share net asset value of the Funds.

6. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act,
if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe
that the proposed arrangements satisfy the standards for an exemption from the provisions discussed above.

7. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling any
security to such registered investment company. Each Fund may be an affiliated person of each other Fund under section
2(a)(3) of the Act. Applicants assert that section 17(a)(1) was designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies
from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they were associated or to acquire controlling
interests in such enterprises. Applicants submit that the sale of securities issued by the Funds pursuant to the Agreement
does not implicate the concerns of Congress in enacting this section, but merely would facilitate the matching of
each Fund's liability for deferred fees with the Underlying Securities that would determine the amount of such liability.
Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that
the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered
investment company, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants assert that
the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 17(b). 

8. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 generally prevent a registered investment company's joint or joint and several
participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement
or profit-sharing plan on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the affiliated person. Applicants
assert that any adjustments made to the Deferred Fee Accounts to reflect the income, gain, or loss on investments of
the assets of a Fund would be identical in amount to income, gain, and loss by other shareholders in the Fund. An Eligible
Trustee would neither directly or indirectly receive a benefit that otherwise would inure to the Funds or their shareholders.
Deferral of an Eligible Trustee's fees in accordance with the Agreement essentially would maintain the parties,
viewed both separately and in their relationship to one another, in the same position as if the fees were paid on a current
basis. When all payments have been made to an Eligible Trustee, such Eligible Trustee will be, relative to the Funds,
no better off than if such Eligible Trustee had received deferred fees on a current basis and invested them in shares
of the Underlying Securities. 



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. With respect to the requested relief from rule 2a-7, any money market Fund that values its assets by the amortized
cost method or penny-rounding method will buy and hold Underlying Securities that determine the performance of Deferred
Fee Accounts to achieve an exact match between such Fund's liability to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset
that liability.

2. If a Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by an affiliated Fund, the purchasing Fund will vote such shares
in proportion to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the Application; the complete Application is available for a free from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. The Applicant (formerly, the GNMA Trust) is a Massachusetts business trust and an open-end, diversified investment
management company registered under the 1940 Act.

2. On December 17, 1985, Applicant filed a notification of registration under Section 8(a) of the 1940 Act and a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act registering an unlimited number of shares
of beneficial interest. The registration statement became effective on July 22, 1986, and the initial public offering
commenced July 25, 1986.

3. On August 13, 1993, Applicant's board of trustees unanimously approved the terms of an agreement and plan of reorganization
(``Plan''). The Plan was approved by Applicant's shareholders on December 10, 1993. Applicant relied upon Rule 17a-8
under the 1940 Act in determining to merge its assets into an existing series of a registered investment management
company.

4. On December 16, 1993, Applicant made a final distribution of dividend income to its security holders in the amount
of $0.1825 per share, for a total distribution of $342,672.

5. On December 17, 1993, pursuant to the Plan, Applicant transferred all of its assets to Colonial U.S. Fund for Growth
(``Colonial Growth'') in a non-taxable transaction. Colonial Growth is a series of Colonial Trust VI, a registered
management investment company. In exchange for the transfer of assets, Colonial Growth assumed Applicant's liabilities
and issued 

pro rata 

to Applicant's shareholders 3,552,164 of Colonial Growth Class A shares at a rate of 1.88 shares for each former share
of the Applicant. The exchange resulted in the complete liquidation, distribution and cancellation of 1,885,910.722
shares of Applicant then outstanding, valued at $42,692,625.55 based on the closing net asset value for Applicant
and the Colonial Growth as of December 17, 1993 of $22.64 and $12.02, respectively. The aggregate net assets of Colonial
Growth immediately after the exchange were $227,715,458. The Plan did not affect the net asset value of the shares
held by Applicant's shareholders.

6. Applicant's investment adviser paid all expenses incurred in connection with the Plan. These expenses totaled
approximately $79,063, and consisted of legal, auditing, printing, mailing and proxy solicitation expenses. No
brokerage commissions were paid with respect to the Plan.

7. Applicant has retained no assets and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities
which remain outstanding and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding.

8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries
of which were or are security holders of Applicant.

9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant will, after receipt of the relief requested, file certificates of dissolution
or similar documents in accordance with state law.

10. Applicant states that it is current with all of its filings under the 1940 Act, including all Form N-SAR filings
for each semi-annual period for which such filing was or is required.

APPLICANTS: 

Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company (``Great-West Life''), Maxim Series Account (``Separate Account''),
and The Great West Life Assurance Company (``Great West Assurance'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS:

 Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>

SUMMARY OF APPLICATION:

 Applicants seek an order permitting the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of: (a) The
Separate Account in connection with the offer and sale of certain flexible premium payment variable annuity contracts
(``Contracts''); (b) the Separate Account in connection with the issuance of variable annuity contracts that are
substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts (``Future Contracts''); and (c) any other separate
account established in the future by Great-West Life in connection with the issuance of Future Contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representatives;



1. Great-West Life is a stock file insurance company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great-West Assurance. Great-West
Assurance is a subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco, Inc. (``Great-West Lifeco''), an insurance holding company and
a subsidiary of Power Financial Corporation of Canada, a financial services company. Great-West Life is principally
engaged in offering insurance and annuity contracts, and is admitted to do business in the District of Columbia and
in all states, except New York.

2. The Separate Account is a separate investment account established by Great-West Life for the purpose of investing
purchase payments received under the Contracts. The Separate Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment
trust and the Contracts are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933.

The Separate Account currently has nine investment divisions (``Divisions''). Seven Divisions invest solely in
corresponding portfolios of the Maxim Series Fund Inc. (``Maxim Fund''), and two Divisions invest solely in corresponding
Portfolios of TCI Portfolios Inc. (``TCI Fund'') (collective, ``Funds''). Each Division is subdivided into six
subaccounts (``Subaccounts''), two of which are used for allocations under the Contracts. The remaining four Subaccounts
are used for allocations under other variable annuity contracts previously offer by Great-West life. Additional
Divisions may be established in the future to invest in other portfolios of Maxim Fund or TCI Fund, or in other investments.

Great-West Life may, in the future, issue through the Separate Account, and through other separate accounts that
it may establish in the future, other variable annuity contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects
to the Contracts (collectively, ``Future Contracts'').

3. Maxim Fund and TCI Fund are registered open-end, diversified investment companies under the 1940 Act, each consisting
of one or more investment series or portfolios (collectively, ``Portfolios'') with different investment objectives
and policies. Great-West Life purchases and redeems Portfolio shares for the corresponding Divisions at net asset
value. Shares of the Funds also are offered to other affiliated or unaffiliated separate accounts of insurance companies
offering variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts.

4. Great-West Assurance will serve as the principal underwriter of the Contracts. Great-West Assurance is a subsidiary
of Great-West Lifeco and is an affiliate of Great-West Life. Great-West Assurance is registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

5. The Contracts are to be used in connection with retirement plans that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment
under Section 401 or Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code as an individual retirement plan (``Qualified Plan'')
or with plans purchased on a non-tax qualified basis (``Non-Qualified Plan''). The Contracts may be used for other
purposes in the future, or offered only in connection with Qualified or Non-Qualified Plans.

6. The Contracts provide for minimum initial purchase payments and permit additional minimum purchase payments
and periodic payments, subject to certain limitations. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a
variable basis determined by the investment experience of the Divisions to which the Contract owner allocates Purchase
Payments. The Contracts also provide four Annuity Options for the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and/or variable
basis.

7. The Contracts also provide for the payment of a death benefit. If the Annuitant dies prior to the date on which annuity
payments are to begin (``Retirement Date'') and before age 75, the death benefit will be equal to the greater of either;
(a) Contract Value less premium taxes, if any; or (b) total purchase payments made, less any partial surrenders of
Contract Value, surrender charges, periodic payments, and premium taxes, if any. If the Annuitant dies prior to Retirement
Date and after age 75, the Contract Value, less premium taxes, if any, will be paid to the beneficiary.

8. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts. An annual maintenance charge of $27 will be deducted
from the Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date to compensate Great-West Life for administrative services.
This charge is guaranteed not to exceed the cost of services to be provided over the life of the Contract, in accordance
with the provisions of Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act. Great-West Life does not anticipate any profit from this
charge.

9. Any premium or other taxes assessed by any governmental entity will be paid by Great-West Life. If the Contract Value
is used to purchase an annuity under the Annuity Options, the dollar amount of any premium tax previously paid or payable
upon annuitization by Great-West Life will be charged against Contract Value. The applicable premium tax rates currently
range from 0% to 2.50%. The Separate Account and the Divisions will bear their own operating expenses and charges for
federal income taxes, should such taxes be incurred by Great-West Life in connection with the operation of the Separate
Account. No charge is made by Great-West Life for transfers of Contract Value among the Divisions. The Contracts also
are not subject to any Contract policy fee.

10. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
is deducted on any total or partial surrender of Contract Value prior to the Retirement Date that are attributable
to Purchase Payments which have been credited to a Contract for less than seven years. Up to 10% of Contract Value as
of December 31 of a calendar year prior to the year in which the amount is being surrendered can be withdrawn once per
year without incurring the CDSC. Additional withdrawals are subject to a surrender charge equal to a percentage of
the amount distributed according to the following schedule:





Total surrender charges will not exceed 7% of Purchase Payments under the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed on or after
the seventh year of the Contracts. Applicants are relying on Rule 6c-8 under the 1940 Act to deduct the CDSC.

Great-West Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing
the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from Great-West Life's
general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks, discussed
below.

11. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the net asset value of the Separate Account will be imposed
to compensate Great-West Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts and
in connection with Future Contracts. Of this amount, 0.85% is allocable to mortality risks and 0.40% is allocable
to expense risks. No deduction will be made for mortality and expense risks after the Retirement Date under Contracts
electing certain Annuity Options that do not vary with the investment performance of the Divisions. The mortality
and expense risk charge is guaranteed never to exceed 1.25%. This charge may be a source of profit for Great-West Life
which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution expenses.

12. The mortality risk arises from Great-West Life's contractual obligations to make Annuity Payments where one
of the Life Annuity Options is selected (determined in accordance with the Annuity Tables and other provisions contained
in the Contracts) regardless of how long an Annuitant may live. The mortality risk under the Contracts is the risk that,
upon selection of an Annuity Option with a life contingency, Annuitants will live longer than Great-West Life's actuarial
projections indicate, thereby resulting in higher than expected Annuity Payments. Great-West Life also assumes
a mortality risk if the Annuitant should die prior to the Contract anniversary nearest the 75th birthday. In that event,
Great-West Life is at risk to the extent that the amount of the Purchase Payments made exceed the Contract Value, less
partial surrenders and surrender charges as of the date notice of death is received.

13. The expense risk borne by Great-West Life is the risk that the charges for administrative expenses, which are guaranteed
not to increase for the life of the Contracts, may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of issuing and administering
the Contracts in excess of the Contract Maintenance Charge. 



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an order of the Commission under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Section 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the dedication of a maximum charge of 1.25% for the assumption of mortality
and expense risks from the assets of: (a) The Separate Account in connection with the issuance of the Contracts; (b)
the Separate Account in connection with the issuance of any Future Contracts; and (c) any other separate account established
in the future by Great-West Life in connection with the issuance of Future Contracts. Applicants believe that the
requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
2. Applicants submit that their request for exemptive relief for deduction of the 1.25% mortality and expense risk
charge from the assets of the Separate Account, or any other separate account established by Great-West Life in the
future, in connection with the issuance of Future Contracts, would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity
contract market by eliminating the need for Great-West Life the file redundant exemptive applications, thereby
reducing Great-West Life's administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Applicants
further submit that the delay and expense involved in having repeatedly to seek exemptive relief would impair Great-West
Life's ability effectively to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Further, if Great-West Life
were required repeatedly to seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application,
investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby. Thus, Applicants believe that the requested
exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 

3. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
4. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust,
its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit
any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself. 

5. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is within the range of
industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based on Applicants' analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge
levels, the manner in which charges are imposed, the existence of charge level or annuity-rate guarantees, and the
markets in which the Contracts are offered. Applicants represent that Great-West Life will maintain at its administrative
offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of,
and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. 

Similarly, prior to making available any Future Contracts through the Separate Account, or through other separate
accounts established in the future by Great-West Life, Applicants will represent that the mortality and expense
risk charge under any such Future Contracts will be within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts.
Applicants represent that Great-West Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission,
a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology, and results of, its
comparative survey. 
6. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts,
all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. Great-West
Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by Great-West Life at its administrative offices and will be made available to the Commission.


Additionally, Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge under
Future Contracts, all or a portion of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the
CDSC. Great-West Life also will maintain and make available to the Commission a memorandum setting forth the basis
for the same representation with respect to Future Contracts offered by the Separate Account and by any other separate
account established in the future by Great-West Life. 

7. Applicants also represents that the Separate Account, and separate accounts established by Great-West Life in
the future, will invest only in underlying funds which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b-1
to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors or trustees, majority of whom are not ``interested
persons'' of the company, formulate and approve any such plan. 



Condition



Applicants undertake that such Future Contracts funded by the Separate Account, or by separate accounts established
in the future by Great-West, which seek to rely on the order issued pursuant to this Application will be substantially
similar in all material respects to the Contracts. 



Conclusion 



For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

 Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').






applicant:

 The Park Avenue Portfolio (the ``Portfolio'').





Relevant Act sections:

 Order requested under section 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from section 17(a), and under section 17(d) of the Act
and rule 17d-1 thereunder permitting certain joint transactions.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary of application:

 Applicant requests an order to permit The Guardian U.S. Government Securities Fund series (the ``Government Fund'')
of the Portfolio to merge with The Guardian Investment Quality Bond Fund series (the ``Bond Fund'') of the Portfolio.
Because of certain affiliations, the two series may not rely on rule 17a-8 under the Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations




1. The Portfolio is an open-end management investment company. Prior to October 14, 1992, the Portfolio was known
as The Guardian U.S. Government Trust (the ``Trust''), and issued shares in a single series. Effective October 14,
1992, the Trust changed its name to ``The Park Avenue Portfolio'' and established six additional series within the
Portfolio. These series include the Government Fund and the Bond Fund, as well as The Guardian Park Avenue Fund, The
Guardian Baillie Gifford International Fund (the ``International Fund''), The Guardian Asset Allocation Fund,
The Guardian Tax-Exempt Fund, and The Guardian Cash Management Fund.

2. Guardian Investor Services Corporation (``GISC'') serves as the distributor for all of the series and as investment
adviser for all of the series except the International Fund. GISC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Insurance
& Annuity Company, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guardian Life Insurance Company of America
(``Guardian Life''). Guardian Life is a mutual life insurance company organized in the State of New York.

3. GISC provided the initial capital for the Trust in 1989. As of June 30, 1994, GISC owned 13.55% of the Government Fund
and may be considered to control the Fund. In January 1993, Guardian Life provided the initial capital for the Bond
Fund. As of June 30, 1994, Guardian Life owned 50.24% of the Bond Fund and may be considered to control the Fund. The investment
objective of the Government Fund is to achieve a high level of current return through a combination of interest income
and net capital gains consistent with prudent investment risk and security of principal. The investment objective
of the Bond Fund is to secure a high level of current income and capital appreciation without undue risk to principal.
4. At a meeting held on June 23, 1994, the board of trustees of the Portfolio, including a majority of those trustees
who are not ``interested persons'' as defined in the Act, approved an agreement and plan of reorganization the ``Plan'').
Pursuant to the Plan, on the effective date of the transaction (the ``Closing Date''), the Government Fund will transfer
all of its assets and liabilities to the Bond Fund in exchange for a number of shares of the Bond Fund having an aggregate
net asset value equal to the aggregate net assets of the Government Fund exchanged. The Government Fund then will distribute
such Bond Fund shares to its shareholders on a 

pro rata

 basis. Each Government Fund shareholder will have his or her Government Fund shares exchanged for the number of full
and fractional shares of the Bond Fund which, when multiplied by the net asset value per share of Bond Fund, will have
an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of that holder's shares in the Government Fund on
the Closing Date. On July 29, 1994, the Portfolio registered the shares of the Bond Fund to be issued pursuant to the
Plan with the SEC on Form N-14.

5. While the Bond Fund ordinarily imposes in initial sales charge in connection with the purchase of shares, the sales
charge will not apply to shares of the Bond Fund acquired pursuant to the proposed reorganization. Neither Fund imposes
a contingent deferred sales charge or other fee in connection with the redemption of shares.

6. In evaluating whether to adopt the Plan and recommend its approval by shareholders of the Government Fund, the board
of trustees has considered the following factors, among others: (a) The potential benefits of the reorganization
to shareholders; (b) the compatibility of investment objectives, policies, restrictions and investment holdings
of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund; (c) the current total net assets of the two Funds and the current and historical
expenses and performance of each Portfolio; (d) the terms and conditions of the proposed reorganization and whether
it would result in dilution of any shareholder's interest; (e) the absence of any direct or indirect costs to be incurred
by either Fund or the Portfolio; and (f) the tax-free nature of the reorganization.

7. The Portfolio will submit the proposed Plan to the shareholders of the Government Fund for their approval at a meeting
called for that purpose on October 19, 1994. Shareholders of the Government Fund will receive a notice of the special
meeting of shareholders and a proxy statement and prospectus containing all material disclosures, including a description
of all material aspects of the proposed reorganization and a copy of the Plan. Consistent with the declaration of trust,
a majority of the outstanding shares of the Government Fund must approve the reorganization. GISC will vote the shares
it owns in the Government Fund in favor of the Plan and will pay all the costs of the reorganization. In addition to shareholders
approval, the consummation of the reorganization is conditioned upon receipt from the SEC of the order requested
herein.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 17(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered
company, any security or other property. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly
or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
any other person is an affiliated person of that person.

2. Section 17(b) provides that the SEC may exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the
terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy
of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.

3. Rule 17a-8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases
or sales of substantially all the assets involving registered investment companies that may be affiliated persons,
or affiliated persons of an affiliated person, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors
and/or common officers. The exemption provided by the rule is conditioned upon a determination by a majority of the
directors of each such investment company (including a majority of the directors of each company who are not interested
persons of the participating registered investment companies) that (a) participation in the transaction is in the
best interests of that registered investment company, and (b) the interests of existing shareholders of that registered
investment company will not be diluted as a result of the transaction.
4. The proposed reorganization could rely on rule 17a-8, except for the fact that the Government Fund and the
Bond Fund may be affiliated persons for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. Because GISC, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Guardian Life, directly owns more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of the Government Fund,
and Guardian Life directly owns more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of the Bond Fund, if the series funds
are treated as separate entities, the Portfolio may not rely upon rule 17a-8 because the Bond Fund and the Government
Fund may be affiliated persons because of the ultimate ownership by a single shareholder.
5. The Portfolio believes that the terms of the proposed reorganization meet the standards of section 17(b). The board
of trustees of the Portfolio, including a majority of the trustees who are not ``interested persons,'' has reviewed
and approved the terms of the proposed reorganization as set forth in the Plan, including the consideration to be paid
or received by all parties. They have independently determined for each of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund, that
the proposed reorganization will be in the best interests of the shareholders of each Fund and that the consummation
of the proposed reorganization will not result in the dilution of the current interests of the shareholders of the
Funds. If effectuated according to the Plan, the proposed reorganization will result in the Government Fund's assets
being managed together with the Bond Fund's assets in a combined portfolio of substantially greater size. The investment
objectives of the Government Fund and the Bond Fund are substantially similar, to provide positive total returns
without undue risks. The proposed transaction will comply with all the conditions that rule 17a-8 requires
for the protection of investment companies and their shareholders.
6. Section 17(d) prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as principal, from effecting
any transaction in which such registered investment company is a joint participant with such person in contravention
of SEC rules and regulations. Rule 17d-1 provides that no joint enterprise or arrangement may be consummated
unless the SEC first approves the transaction.
7. The Funds may be affiliated persons of each other, and the proposed transaction might be deemed to be a joint enterprise
or other joint arrangement. The Portfolio believes that the terms of the proposed Plan meet the standards for relief
under rule 17d-1, in that the terms of the Plan are reasonable and fair to all parties, do not involve overreaching
and are consistent with the investment policies of the Funds. The participation in the Plan by each Fund is also not
on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants.

Applicants' Representations


1. Each of the Investment Companies is an open-end management investment company organized under the laws of the State
of Maryland. The Manager serves as the investment adviser for the Investment Companies.
2. The Board of Directors of each Investment Company currently consists of seven persons, five of whom are not ``interested
persons'' of that Investment Company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. Each director is entitled
to receive an annual fee plus meeting attendance fees from each Investment Company, except that directors who are
interested persons of the Manager receive no remuneration from the Investment Companies. Non-interested directors
who serve on certain committees of the directors are entitled to additional fees for such service. The aggregate amount
payable to the non-interested directors will be 

de minimis

 in comparison to the aggregate net assets of the existing Funds.
3. Applicants propose to implement a Deferred Compensation Plan for non-interested directors (the ``Plan''). The
purpose of the Plan is to permit individual directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of the fees (the ``Deferred
Fees'') to enable them to defer payment of income taxes on such fees or for other financial goals. Applicants believe
that the availability of deferred fee arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain qualified
directors.
4. Under the Plan, a director's Deferred Fees are credited as of the date such fees would have been paid to a separate
book reserve account established with respect to each series of each participating Fund (each a ``Deferred Fee Account'').
The value of the Deferred Fee Account as of any date will be equal to the value each account would have had of such date
if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested as of the date credited in shares of certain
designated series of the Funds. Shares of any series of any Fund, other than TCI or Premium Reserves,
 as the Plan Committee and the participating director shall have agreed upon in writing from time to time, may be selected
(the ``Designated Shares''). Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited or charged with book adjustments representing
all interest, dividends, and other earnings, and all gains and losses that would have been realized had such account
been invested in the Designated Shares.




5. With respect to the obligations created under the Plan, each director will remain a general unsecured creditor.
The Plan does not create an obligation of any Fund to any director to purchase, hold, or dispose of any investments,
and if a Fund or series thereof should choose to purchase investments, including Designated Shares, all such investments
will continue to be part of the general assets and property of such Fund or series.
6. As a matter of prudent risk management, each Fund intends, where it determines appropriate, and with respect to
money management series that employ the amortized cost method of valuation, will undertake, to purchase and maintain
Designated Shares in amounts equal to the amount of Deferred Fees so credited.
7. The Plan will allow a director to elect to defer payment of fees payable to him by a Fund with respect to any year (including
all adjustments representing interest, dividends and other earnings, and all gains and losses, credited or charged
with respect thereof) until (a) the director ceases to be a director of the Fund or (b) the Plan is terminated. Payments
to directors may be made in a lump sum or in such number of annual installments (not to exceed 10) as shall be elected by
the director. In the event of death, amounts payable to the director under the Plan will become payable to his designated
beneficiary; in all other events, the director's right to receive payments will be non-transferable.
8. The Plan will not obligate any Fund to retain the services of a director, nor will it obligate any Fund or series to
pay any (or any particular level of) fees to any director. Rather, it will merely permit a director to defer receipt
of those fees that would otherwise be payable from each Fund.

9. No Fund will purchase any Designated Shares, nor will it credit the Deferred Fee Accounts as though it had purchased
any Designated Shares, before the requested exemptive order is issued.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Sections 13(a)(2), 13(a)(3), 18(f)(1), 22(f), 22(g), 17(a)(1), and 17(d) of the Act and rules 2a-1 and 17d-1
thereunder, taken together, might be deemed to preclude the Funds and their directors from implementing the Plan
absent an exemptive order form the Commission. Each Investment Company and the Manager believes, however, that the
Plan is and will be in the best interests of each Fund adopting the Plan and its shareholders and is and will be consistent
with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, applicants believe that exemption
of the deferred fee arrangement and transactions related thereto from certain provisions of the Act is necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.
2. Applicants submit that the ability of the Funds to recruit and retain highly qualified directors will be enhanced
if they are able to offer their directors the option of deferred payment of fees. Moreover, on a comparative basis,
deferral would have a negligible effect on each Fund's total assets and liabilities because the total fees paid to
each director will be 

de minimis

 in relation to the size of each Fund, and will have no effect on net assets and net income per share.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any class
of senior security or selling any senior security of which it is the issuer. In addition, section 13(a)(2) of the Act
requires that a registered investment company obtain authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting
securities before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy contained in its registration
statement. The Plan does not and would not give rise to any of the ``evils'' that led to Congress' concerns in enacting
these provisions.
 4. Section 13(a)(3) of the Act prohibits registered investment companies from, absent shareholder approval, deviating
from any ``fundamental'' investment policy that is changeable only upon shareholder approval. The fundamental
investment policies of certain series of the Funds
 would prohibit investment in Designated Shares of other series offered by the Funds. Any series of the Funds with these
types of policies would be prevented, without shareholder approval, from purchasing shares of other series of the
Funds. If any such series of Funds are prevented from so investing, they will not be able to effect the matching of Designated
Shares with the liabilities credited to the Deferred Fee Accounts. This matching is desirable because it will help
ensure that the deferred fee arrangements will not affect the net asset value of any series' shares. Applicants believe
that it is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act to exempt the Funds from the provisions of section 13(a)(3). The relief
requested from section 13(a)(3) would extend only to the specifically named applicants and not to future investment
companies or series because future open-end management investment companies or future series of currently effective
open-end management companies will be able to establish fundamental policies with the necessary exceptions to accommodate
purchases of Fund shares in connection with the Plan.




5. Section 22(f) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company from restricting the transferability
or negotiability of any security of which it is the issuer unless the restriction is disclosed in its registration
statement and does not contravene rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission. Section 22(g) of the Act generally
prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or for property
other than cash or securities.

<DOCNO> FR941003-2-00186 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

6. Section 22(f) was designed to bar only those restrictions on transferability or negotiability not disclosed to
the holder of the subject security or expressly prohibited by Commission rule or regulations, neither of which circumstances
would apply to the restriction of transferability of a director's benefits under the Plan. Such restriction is clearly
set forth in the Plan, is included primarily to benefit the participating director, and does not adversely affect
the interests of the directors or of a shareholder of any Fund.
7. With respect to section 22(g), the legislative history of the Act suggests that Congress was concerned with the
dilutive effect on the equity and voting power of common stock of, or units of beneficial interest in, an open-end company
if the company's securities were issued for consideration not readily valued. Applicants assert that the Plan would
not have this effect. Also, a director's right to receive payments under the Plan are not granted in return for services
or property other than cash already owed to the director. Although any director's fees that may be payable to a director
would clearly be for services rendered, a Fund's obligation to pay such fees would exist whether or not the Plan was
in effect. The Plan would merely provide for deferral of the payment of such fees and thus any rights under the Plan should
be viewed as being ``issued'' not for services but for the Fund's not being required to pay such fees on a current basis.
Thus, the requested exemption of the proposed deferred fee arrangement and future transactions effected pursuant
to such arrangement from section 22(g) of the Act would not be inconsistent with the protection of investors and the
purposes of the Act.
8. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any
affiliated person of such person, from selling any security to such registered investment company. The section was
designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises
with which they are associated or to acquire controlling interest in such enterprises. Applicants believe that the
sale of securities issued by the various series of the Funds pursuant to the Plan does not implicate Congress concerns
in enacting this section, but merely facilities the matching of the liabilities for Deferred Fees with Designated
Shares, the value of which determines the amount of such liabilities.
9. Rule 2a-7 provides that the current price per share of any ``money market fund'' may be computed by use of the
amortized cost method or the penny-rounding method, provided that the money market funds meets certain conditions.
These conditions include, among others, (a) that the money market fund limit its investments to securities that have
a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and that meet certain quality standards and (b) that the money market fund will
not maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 90 days. Applicants believe that an exemption
from rule 2a-7 for each money market fund to the limited extent required to permit them to invest in Designated
Shares (and to exclude Designated Shares from the calculation of such series' dollar-weighted average maturities)
is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act. Such an exemption would permit the series in question to achieve an exact matching
of Designated Shares with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred
fee arrangements will not affect net asset value.
10. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder are designed to limit or prevent a registered investment
company's joint or joint and several participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with
any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan on a basis different or less advantageous
than that of the affiliated person.
11. Under the Plan, each Fund will have discretion to set aside cash to fund the general obligations accruing thereunder,
and each Fund may invest cash in those shares of one or more series of Funds representing Designated Shares. Adjustments
are to be made to the Deferred Fee Accounts to reflect the income, gain or loss with respect to the Designated Shares.
The changes in value would be identical to the changes in share value experienced by any shareholder of the same series
during the same period, but whose shares were not held in a Deferred Fee Account.
As an affiliated person, the participating director would neither directly nor indirectly receive a benefit that
would otherwise inure to the Funds or any of their shareholders and thus the Plan would not constitute a joint or joint
and several participation by any Fund with an affiliated person on a basis different from or less advantageous than
that of the affiliated person.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:
1. With respect to the requested relief from rule 2a-7, any money market series of the Funds that values its assets
by the amortized cost method will buy and hold Designated Shares that determine the performance of Deferred Fee Accounts
to achieve an exact match between such series' liability to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset that liability.
2. If a Fund purchases Designated Shares issued by an affiliated Fund, the Fund will vote such shares in proportion
to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch




Applicants' Representations





1. Sentry is a stock life insurance company that was organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin in 1958. SILIC
is a stock life insurance company that was originally organized in 1966 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
as Patriot General Life Insurance Company. SILIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sentry. SESI is registered with
the SEC as a broker-dealer, is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and serves as the principal
underwriter for variable annuity contracts issued 
through the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account (the ``Sentry Contracts'' and the ``SILIC Contracts,'' respectively,
and, together, the ``Contracts''). Sentry, SILIC , and SESI are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Sentry Insurance
a Mutual Company, a Wisconsin mutual insurer. 



2. Sentry established the Sentry Account in 1983 pursuant to the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The Sentry Account
is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust, and the Sentry Contracts are registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (``1993 Act''). SILIC established the SILIC Account in 1983 to the laws of the Commonwealth of 


 Massachusetts. The SILIC Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, and the SILIC Contracts
are registered under the 1933 Act.


3. Each Account consists of four subaccounts: a Liquid Asset Subaccount; a Growth Subaccount; a Limited Maturity
Bond Subaccount; and a Balanced Subaccount. Each of the subaccounts invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding
portfolio of the Neuberger & Berman Advisers Management Trust (``Fund''). The Fund is registered under the 1940
Act as a diversified open-end management investment company, and the shares issued by the Fund are registered under
the 1933 Act. 


4. The Sentry Contracts and the SILIC Contracts are identical in all material respects, except for the identity and
depositor of the separate account issuing the respective Contract. The Contracts provide for the accumulation of
contract values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a variable basis. The Contracts are designed for use by
individuals in retirement plans on a qualified or non-qualified basis. 


5. Sentry has or will shortly enter into an agreement providing for the sale of all outstanding stock of SILIC to an unrelated
third party. One of the conditions of the sale will be that Sentry and SILIC enter into an assumption reinsurance arrangement
providing for the transfer to Sentry of all assets and liabilities of SILIC, other than the minimum amount of capital
necessary to support SILIC's licenses. Sentry will, pursuant to the assumption reinsurance agreement, assume legal
ownership of the SILIC Account assets and become responsible for satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations
arising under the SILIC Contracts and outstanding at the time of the transaction.


6. In order to avoid the administrative duplication that would result from maintaining two identical unit investment
trusts, Sentry has decided to effectively merge the Accounts by transferring the assets of the SILIC Account (consisting
of shares of the Fund) to the Sentry Account (the ``Proposed Transaction''). The Sentry Account will continue to exist,
and the SILIC Separate Account thereafter will be deregistered as an investment 


 company. The effect of the Proposed Transaction will be that, as of its effective date, the Sentry Account will support
the Sentry Contracts, the SILIC Contracts (

i.e.,

 those originally issued by the SILIC Account), and any Contracts issued subsequent to the effective date of the Proposed
Transaction. The assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts will continue to be invested exclusively in shares
of the Fund. 


7. The Proposed Transaction will be effected at the net asset values of the subaccounts involved, and no charges will
be imposed or other deductions made in connection therewith. The Proposed Transaction also will not affect the net
asset value of any subaccount: the net asset values for the four subaccounts of the Sentry Account in effect immediately
after the transaction will be identical to the net asset values for the subaccounts of the SILIC Account in effect immediately
prior to the transaction. All costs of the transaction will be borne by Sentry and not by Contractowners.


8. The succession of Sentry to SILIC as the insurance company issuing the Contracts will not dilute or otherwise adversely
affect the economic interests of the Contractowners. The only change discernible to a Contractowner as a result of
the Proposed Transaction will be the identity and depositor of the separate account in which his or her cash value is
invested. The fees deducted from assets supporting the former SILIC Contracts after the Proposed Transaction will
not differ in amount or type from those currently being deducted from the Sentry Account. After the Proposed Transaction,
the guarantees that are not allocated to the Sentry Account (

e.g.,

 the minimum death benefit) will be backed by Sentry's pool of assets, which, based on financial information as of December
31, 1993, is more than sixty times larger than SILIC's. Moreover, as of the date hereof, Sentry is rated ``A+'' by A.M.
Best, while SILIC is rated ``NA4'' (rating procedure inapplicable). 


9. The Proposed Transaction and the other transactions related to the sale of SILIC will be approved in advance by the
respective Boards of Directors of Sentry and SILIC. Prior approval of the transaction will be obtained from the Massachusetts
Insurance 



 Department and any other applicable regulatory authority. To the extent notification to Contractowners is required
pursuant to generally applicable state insurance laws relating to assumption reinsurance, it will be provided.
Applicable state insurance law does not require that Contractowners vote on the transaction or be granted any ``opt-out''
rights. 


10. In offer to reflect the transfer of assets supporting the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account, Sentry will file
a new 1933 Act registration statement for the Contracts and will amend the 1940 Act registration statement for the
Sentry Account. Once the new 1933 Act registration statement becomes effective, Sentry will distribute copies of
the prospectus contained therein to owners of outstanding Contracts. Once the Proposed Transaction is effected,
application will be made to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act and Rule 8f-1 thereunder for an
order declaring that the SILIC Account has ceased to be an investment company.

11. Certain charges will be imposed under the SILIC Contracts proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account. Sentry
will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge equal on an annual basis to 1.20% of the average daily net asset value
of the Sentry Account. Of this charge, .80% will be for mortality risks and .40% will be for expense risks. This charge
compensates Sentry for providing a mortality guarantee, a death benefit, an expense guarantee, and the waiver of
the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, if any, upon the death of the annuitant.

12. Sentry will deduct a contract maintenance charge of $30 per SILIC Contract from contract values on each contract
anniversary the SILIC Contract is in force, or when the value of the SILIC Contract is withdrawn in full prior to a contract
anniversary. Sentry guarantees that the amount of the contract maintenance charge will not be increased in the future.


13. No sales charge was imposed on the SILIC Contracts at the time of sale. A contingent deferred sales charge is imposed
on surrenders of purchase payments within six years after their being made. Thereafter, the charge is equal to zero.
The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is calculated by allocating purchase payments to the amount surrendered,
multiplying each such allocated purchase payment by the appropriate percentage determined on the basis of the table
below, and adding the products of each such multiplication.







The contingent deferred sales charge is intended to provide reimbursement for sales-related expenses. To the extent
the charge is insufficient to cover all distribution costs, Sentry may use the mortality and expense risk charge to
make up any difference.

14. Sentry will permit SILIC Contractowners to transfer all or part of the contract values between eligible mutual
fund(s) or portfolio(s) subject to certain conditions. Currently, Sentry does not impose any charge for effecting
transfers but it reserves the right to assess a transfer fee in the future subject to prior Commission approval or pursuant
to any applicable exemptive release issued by the Commission.

15. Any premium taxes payable to any governmental entity as a result of the existence of the SILIC Contracts or the Sentry
Account will be charged against contract value. Premium taxes currently imposed range from 0% to 4.0%.


16. Sentry deducts from the Sentry Account any income taxes resulting from the operation of the Sentry Account. Sentry
has not made a provision for taxes within the Sentry Account for the payment of any tax obligation because Sentry believes
that the operations of the Sentry Account and the underlying Trust will be conducted in such a manner as to not give rise
to such tax obligation. Sentry has reserved the right, however, to establish such a provision in the future if it determines
that it will incur a tax as a result of the operation of the Sentry Account.


17. On July 17, 1984, the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act to SILIC, the SILIC Account, and
SESI, exempting them from Sections 26(a) and 27(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit certain deductions
and practices in connection with the SILIC Contracts. The SEC granted identical relief on the same day to Sentry, the
Sentry Account, and SESI in connection with the Sentry Contracts.



Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such a person, from knowingly selling any securities or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2)
of the Act prohibits these persons from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment
company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person to include any person directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such other person. The Sentry Account and
the SILIC Account may be deemed to be under the common control of Sentry, which is the depositor of the Sentry Account
and the parent of the depositor of the SILIC Account. While Applicants do not concede that Section 17(a) applies to
the Proposed Transaction, because the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account are affiliated persons, the transfer
of assets from the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account arguably involves these entities, acting as principals, in
buying and selling securities or other property from or to one another in contravention of Section 17(a).

2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that a person may apply for an order of exemption from the provisions of Section
17(a) in connection with a transaction prohibited by that section, and that the Commission shall grant such an application
if evidence establishes that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or
received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration
statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes
of the Act.

3. Although Rule 17a-8 is not available in this case, Applicants submit that the Commission can look to the rule
to determine whether the transaction is reasonable and fair. Applicants assert that the participating companies'
investment objectives, policies, restrictions, and portfolios are compatible. Both the Sentry Account and SILIC
Account invest exclusively in shares of the Fund, and, after the Proposed Transaction, the Sentry Account will continue
to invest in shares of the Fund and provide holders of SILIC Contracts with the same investment options as before the
Proposed Transaction. Accordingly, the Proposed Transaction will result in no change in the investment objectives,
policies, restrictions, or portfolios of the separate account funding the SILIC Contracts.

4. Applicants also represent that the transfer of assets held by the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account will be made
at the relative net asset values of the subaccounts. No dilution of, or increase in, the SILIC Contractowners' contract
values will occur as a result of the Proposed Transaction. The transfer will not result in any change in charges, costs,
fees, or expenses borne by Contractowners.

5. Finally, Applicants state that no direct or indirect costs will be incurred by the SILIC Account or the Sentry Account
as a result of the transaction. No charges, costs, fees, or other expenses would be incurred by holders of the Contracts
as a result of, or in connection with, the Proposed Transaction. Thus, the Proposed Transaction will not result in
dilution of the economic interests of the Contractowners.

6. Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction does not involve overreaching on the part of any person involved.
The purpose of the transfer is to consolidate two identical separate accounts, both of which issue identical contracts,
have the same principal underwriter, and invest in the same underlying mutual fund, into a single separate account.
This aggregation will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings on Sentry's part because Sentry can
consolidate its separate account operations. It also will allow SILIC Contractowners to participate in a separate
account that is sizable in terms of its total net assets and can be expected to grow since sales of Sentry contracts will
continue after the Proposed Transaction.


7. Section 17(b) also requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the policy of each registered investment
company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Applicants represent
that because the assets underlying the SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested in shares
of one or more portfolios of the Fund in the same manner as before the Proposed Transaction, the assets underlying the
SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested according to the investment policies recited
in their respective registration statements.

8. Finally, Section 17(b) requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction is consistent with the general policies and purposes of the Act.
The transfer does not present any of the issues or abuses that Section 17(a) in particular, and the 1940 Act in general,
were designed to prevent.

9. In light of the foregoing, Applicants request an exemption from Section 17(a) of the Act, pursuant to Section 17(b)
thereof, to permit the proposed transfer. Applicants represent that the terms of the proposed transfer described
in this Application, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching; are consistent with the investment policies of each of the Accounts; and are consistent with the general
purposes of the Act.

10. Section 26(a)(2)(C) provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties
normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a
depositor or underwriter for such company for selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed in Section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially
the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act.

11. Sentry, the Sentry Account, and SESI (``Section 6(c) Applicants'') request an order under Section 6(c) of the
1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the
deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously
issued through the SILIC Account and proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction.

12. Sentry represents that the charge of 1.20% for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks
undertaken by Sentry and within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This
representation is based upon Sentry's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products,
taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed
annuity rates. Sentry will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting
forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of its comparative survey.

13. The Section 6(c) Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge,
all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the sales charge.
Sentry has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Sentry Account and SILIC Contractowners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
maintained by the Sentry at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

14. Sentry represents that the Sentry Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to
have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section
2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion



Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting the Proposed
Transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a), to the extent necessary to permit that transfer of assets underlying
the SILIC Contracts to the Sentry Account. In addition, the Section 6(c) Applicants request that the Commission issue
an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction by Sentry of mortality and
expense risk charges from Sentry Account as provided for by the SILIC Contracts previously supported by the Sentry
Account pursuant to the Proposed Transaction. Applicants and the Section 6(c) Applicants, as appropriate, submit
that, for all of the reasons stated above, granting the relief requested herein is appropriate in the public interest,
and consistent with the policy and purposes of the 1940 Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Effects of Changes in Aircraft Flight Patterns Over the State
of New Jersey



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Issuance of A Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) For Public Review and Comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA has decided to prepare a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) on the effects of changes
in aircraft flight patterns over the State of New Jersey caused by implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan (EECP).
As a result of the analysis phase of the comment period associated with the DEIS, new information was developed by the
FAA. Additionally, new information was received from the public during the comment period. Since this information
is pertinent to the decision process leading to issuance of a final EIS (FEIS), the public should have an opportunity
to examine the new material and comment on it prior to completion of the FEIS.


The supplemental DEIS (SDEIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Copies
have been mailed to individuals that participated in the EIS process as well as to libraries in select locations throughout
New Jersey.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of key portions of the SDEIS and major areas of concern identified by the public. It is not
intended to duplicate or cover every aspect of the SDEIS. Substantive comments submitted to the FAA should address
the SDEIS, not this summary.


I. Summary of Key Portions of the SDEIS


A. Alternatives and Mitigation Under Consideration


The following alternatives were evaluated and are being considered by the FAA:
(1) Alternative A. Maintain the current (as defined in 1991) EECP structure. (Proposed action and no action)
(2) Alternative B. Return to 1986 air traffic routes and procedures using 1991 traffic. (Rollback)
(3) Alternative C2. Route Newark south flow departure traffic from over Raritan Bay to over the ocean (at night only)
via a specific path defined by the Solberg and Colts Neck navigational aids. (Nighttime only oceanic/military routing)
Alternative D3. Spread aircraft departing Newark runways 22L and 22R to three different headings. (Spreading of
fanning)
These alternatives are described in detail in Chapter 3 of the SDEIS. Two mitigation measures were evaluated and are
also being considered:
(1) Routing some westbound departures from Newark to a new departure gate in the vicinity of the Solberg navigational
aid.
(2) Moving LaGuardia arrival traffic further south from its current routing.
These mitigation measures are described in detail in Chapter 6 of the SDEIS. These measures, if selected by the decision-maker
for implementation, would reduce noise by Day-Night Level (DNL) 5 dB or greater for approximately 18,500 residents
of the Scotch Plains and Fanwood areas of Union County, New Jersey. These were two of the areas that experienced some
of the greatest increases in noise as a result of implementation of the EECP.


B. Environmental Consequences


None of the alternatives would cause significant noise, air quality or water quality impacts. (The one exception
identified in the area of noise results from the assumptions used in reconstructing and modeling the return to 1986
routes and procedures.) Noise analysis indicates that 1.45 million individuals would be impacted by noise increases
of DNL 5 dB or greater if the FAA returned to use of 1986 routes and procedures, while approximately 45,000 individuals
would experience noise benefits of DNL 5 dB or greater. Fanning and nighttime use of ocean routing would have marginal
noise benefits. In response to the volume of comments concerning noise impacts in particular communities, Appendix
F of the SDEIS provides the increases in noise level predicted for each census block in New Jersey.


C. Public Participation


In preparing the SDEIS the FAA has carefully summarized and addressed the comments received on the DEIS and made revisions
to the text as appropriate. There have been extensive opportunities for public participation since the DEIS was made
available on November 12, 1992. In January, 1993, the FAA held public hearings in New Jersey to obtain comments on the
DEIS. In addition, two public meetings were held in Staten Island, New York to address the DEIS and the New York Metropolitan
Area Aircraft Noise Mitigation Review, a study mandated by Congress, which specifically addressed noise issues
in the New York metropolitan area, including parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, separate from the EIS action. The
comment period on the DEIS extended from November 12, 1992 to November 23, 1993. This 369 day comment period was well
in excess on NEPA requirements.


II. Areas of Controversy


In addition to noise, air, and water quality impacts, the major areas of controversy concerning this EIS were alternate
use of ocean routing, effects or aircraft noise on property values, and the scope of the EIS.


A. Ocean Routing


Many commenters believed the alternative of using ocean routes 24 hours a day should be studied in detail as a reasonable
alternative. Several different proposals were considered in the DEIS, but eliminated due to concerns about operational
feasibility and potential environmental impacts. In June 1993, the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research
(NJCER), on behalf of the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise, submitted a proposal to route all Newark Airport
departures south, down the Arthur Kill and over Raritan Bay to the ocean. This study was analyzed operationally and
modeled to determine its noise impacts within the scope of this EIS.
Operational examination indicates this proposal would cause about 5 points of conflicting traffic within New Jersey,
require tunneling of traffic from Newark under traffic from other airports, and cause substantial delays at Newark.
Noise analysis indicates this proposal would have net benefits of DNL 5 dB or greater for approximately 228,000 New
Jersey residents (690,000 residents would benefit while 462,000 residents would experience increased noise of
DNL 5 dB or greater). In addition there appear to be potentially significant adverse noise impacts in areas south of
Newark that would be overflown by aircraft at altitudes below 3,000 above ground level (AGL) feet as well as in New York
and Connecticut. Additional environmental review would be required to examine these impacts, which are beyond the
scope of this EIS. This proposal is described in detail in Chapter 1 of the SDEIS.


B. Effect of Noise on Property Values


Another area of concern was the effect of noise increases on real property values. There is insufficient scientific
data to support a reasonable conclusion about whether the noise levels associated with implementation of the EECP
have, or its alternatives would have, depressed property values in New Jersey. The economic studies of the effects
of airport noise on house values to date, which have found a slight devaluation, have involved properties in or near
urban areas surrounding major airports at noise exposure levels exceeding those in this EIS. This is discussed in
detail in Section 5.2.1 of the SDEIS.


C. Scope of the EIS


Another controversial issue was the scope of the EIS. The legal and policy reasons supporting the decision to limit
the scope of the EIS to New Jersey and to air traffic changes above 3,000 AGL feet are fully explained in Chapter 2 of the
SDEIS and Appendix A. Briefly, the FAA adhered strictly to the congressional mandate to study New Jersey because of
the complexity of an expanded study, the difficulty of identifying objective criteria for excluding portions of
the other 18 States and the District of Columbia that were also potentially affected by the EECP, and the time constraints
on the EIS process. The EIS examines changes above 3,000 AGL feet because that was the scope of the EECP. To assure compliance
with NEPA, no alternative will be selected for implementation until all applicable environmental review requirements
have been satisfied.

Ford Motor Company; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance



Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, Michigan has determined that some of its windows fail to comply with the labeling
requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and
has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford has also applied
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on
the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.

This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgement concerning the merits of the application.

Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z-26.1-1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with
a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.''

Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent
for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab vehicles. These windows were labeled ``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.''
Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows have been used in vehicle production or provided
to aftermarket distributors for service replacement.

For supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:




[Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only
as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and S3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications
in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure
a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility
of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows
fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the
incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended
by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.

The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors
do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined
by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket
servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of Ford, described
above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C., 20590. It is requested but not required that
six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.

<DOCTITLE>General Motors Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>



General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with
49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and has filed an
appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' GM has also applied to be exempted
from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that
the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.

This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgment concerning the merits of the application.

Paragraph S4.6(b) of FMVSS No. 209 states that a seat belt assembly shall be labeled with the following statement:




This seat belt assembly is for use only in [insert specific seating position(s), e.g., `front right'] in [insert specific
vehicles make(s) and model(s)].




GM produced two different populations of vehicles which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard.
The first population of vehicles, 68,405 1994 model year Chevrolet and GMC G-vans, were built with left-side seat
belt assemblies that were labeled as right-side assemblies.

The second population of vehicles, 31,978 1992-94 model year Chevrolet and GMC K20753 extended cap pickups,
were built with front outboard seat belt assemblies with the appropriate model designation omitted. The model designation
is K20753.

GM supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following.




For both these issues, the GM part numbers and manufacturer's model numbers correctly identify the affected seat
belt assemblies. In addition, the service parts manuals correctly specify the proper part numbers if replacement
parts were needed. In the case of the G-van seat belt assemblies, it is not possible to install the left front seat belt
assembly at the right front position. For the K 20753 model, the issue is the omission of an appropriate model. Usage
of the seat belt assembly in any of the models identified on the label is appropriate, as would be usage in the K 20753.

It is GM's understanding that the purposed of the subject requirement was to provide the person 

replacing

 a seat belt assembly in a vehicle with appropriate seat position and vehicle model information. However, original
equipment seat belt assemblies have already been installed in the appropriate models and positions at the assembly
plant. The Agency stated in a recent rulemaking proposal (Docket 74-14; Notice 81, dated May 10, 1993), ``* * *
that seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment in new motor vehicles need not be required to be labeled
with position model information. This information is only useful if the assembly is removed with the intention of
using the assembly as a replacement in another vehicle. NHTSA does not believe this is a common practice.'' GM agrees
and believes that the removal of original equipment seat belt assemblies for the purpose of replacement installation
in another vehicle is rare. The Agency finalized that rulemaking action on April 15, 1994, eliminating the required
label verbiage on seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment by vehicle manufacturers.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of GM, described above.
Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicate below be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the

though it lacks a DOT certification marking, and that all other lights are DOT certified.

Standard No. 111 Rearview Mirrors: inscriptions of the required warning statement on the convex surface of the passenger
side rearview mirror.

Standard No. 114 Theft Protection: installation of a warning buzzer in the steering lock electrical circuit.

Standard No. 115 Vehicle Identification Number: installation of a VIN plate that can be read from outside the left
windshield pillar.

Standard No. 118 Power-Operated Window Systems: rewiring of the power window system so that the window transport
is inoperative when the front doors are open.

Standard No. 120 Tire Selection and Rims for Vehicles Other Than Passenger Cars: installation of a tire information
placard. The petitioner asserts that even though the tire rims lack a DOT certification marking, they comply with
the standard, based on their manufacturer's certification that they comply with the German TUV regulations, as well
as their certification by the British Standards Association and the Rim Association of Australia.

Standard No. 206 Door Locks and Door Retention Components: installation of interior locking buttons on all door locks
and modification of rear door locks to disable latch release controls when locking mechanism is engaged.

Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection: installation of a complying driver's side air bag and a seat belt warning
buzzer. The petitioner asserts that the vehicle conforms to the standard's injury criteria at the front passenger
position based on a test report from the vehicle's manufacturer.

Standard No. 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages: insertion of instructions on the installation and use of child restraints
in the owner's manual for the vehicle. The petitioner asserts that the vehicle is certified as complying with a European
standard that contains more severe force application requirements than those of this standard.

Standard No. 212 Windshield Retention: application of cement to the windshield's edges.

The petitioner provided test data indicating that the vehicle satisfied the frontal barrier requirements of Standard
No. 301 Fuel System Integrity. The petitioner also supplied data on a rear barrier crash at 31 mph with crash forces
approximating those required by the standard. The data revealed that fuel leaked from the vent during the rollover
that was conducted as part of this test. The petitioner installed a rollover valve in the fuel tank line to resolve that
problem. The petitioner also stated that the vehicle should comply with the lateral impact test at the lower speed
of 20 mph due to the reinforcing structure surrounding the fuel tank and the placement of the fuel lines inside the main
frame of the vehicle.

Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will
be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible,
comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action will be published in the Federal

SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1989 Audi 100 that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under 49 U.S.C.  30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C.  30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register 

of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register.

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer 90-006) has petitioned NHTSA to
decide whether 1989 Audi 100 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which
J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Audi 100 that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in,
the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100 to its U.S. certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.

J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100,
as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.
certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Audi 100 is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence. * * *,
