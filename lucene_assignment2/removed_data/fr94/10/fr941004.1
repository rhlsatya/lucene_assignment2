NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 








Fracture Toughness Requirements for 
Light Water Reactor Pressure Vessels 



<AGENCY>

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>

ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its 
regulations for light-water-cooled nuclear power plants to clarify several 
items related to the fracture toughness requirements for reactor pressure 
vessels (RPV). The proposed amendments would clarify the pressurized thermal 
shock (PTS) requirements, make changes to the Fracture Toughness Requirements 
and the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program Requirements, and provide 
new requirements for thermal annealing of a reactor pressure vessel. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Maintaining the structural integrity of the reactor pressure vessel 
(RPV) of light-water-cooled reactors is a critical concern related to the safe 
operation of nuclear power plants. To assure the structural integrity of 
RPVs, NRC regulations and regulatory guides have been developed to provide 
analysis and measurement methods and procedures to assure that each RPV has 
adequate safety margins for continued operation. Structural integrity of a 
reactor pressure vessel is generally assured through a fracture mechanics 
evaluation, including measurement or estimation of the fracture toughness of 
the materials which compose the RPV. However, the fracture toughness of the 
RPV materials varies with time. As the plant operates, neutrons escaping from 
the reactor core impact the vessel beltline materials (e.g. the materials that 
surround the reactor core), causing embrittlement of those materials. The 
NRC's regulations and regulatory guides related to RPV integrity provide the 
criteria and methods needed to estimate the extent of the embrittlement, to 
evaluate the consequences of the embrittlement in terms of the structural 
integrity of the RPV, and to provide methods to mitigate the deleterious 
effects of the embrittlement. 
The NRC has several regulations and regulatory guides that establish 
criteria and procedures for assuring the structural integrity of RPVs. With 
the addition of a proposed rule on thermal annealing and several draft 
regulatory guides, the existing and proposed regulatory documents contribute 
to a comprehensive set of regulations and regulatory guidance pertaining to 
RPV integrity, including: 



1. The fracture toughness criteria that each RPV must satisfy (10 CFR 
50.60, 10 CFR 50.61, and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G). 
2. Irradiation embrittlement surveillance requirements (10 CFR Part 
50, Appendix H). 
3. Guidance for estimating the fracture toughness of the RPV 
(Regulatory Guide 1.99 and a draft regulatory guide on dosimetry). 
4. Guidance for cases in which the RPV is estimated to exceed 
specified screening criteria (Regulatory Guide 1.154 and a draft 
regulatory guide on evaluating RPVs with Charpy upper-shelf energy 
less than 50 ft-lb). 
5. Requirements and guidance for using thermal annealing of the RPV 
as a method for mitigating the effects of neutron irradiation 
(proposed 10 CFR 50.66 and a draft regulatory guide). 



This notice proposes changes to the following requirements: 



a. The Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) rule (10 CFR 50.61). 
b. Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50, ``Fracture Toughness Requirements.'' 
c. Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50, ``Reactor Vessel Material Surveil- 
lance Program Requirements.'' 



This notice also proposes a thermal annealing requirement, 10 CFR 50.66. 
In addition to the proposed amendments addressed in this document, the 
NRC will publish for public comment a draft regulatory guide on thermal 
annealing, DG-1027 (the availability of this draft regulatory guide for will be announced in the 

Federal Register

 at a later date 
comment.) 
Two related draft regulatory guides have been published for public 
comment (58 FR 51392; October 1, 1993). These draft regulatory guides are: 



1. A draft regulatory guide that addresses evaluation of RPVs with Charpy 
upper-shelf energy levels less than 50 ft-lb (DG-1023). 
2. A draft regulatory guide on dosimetry (DG-1025). 



Other regulatory guides pertaining to RPV integrity, Regulatory Guides 
1.99 and 1.154, are under evaluation. Revisions to these guides, if any, will 
be addressed in the future. 
Other regulatory issues related to reactor pressure vessel integrity, 
such as low temperature over-pressure protection system setpoints, are being 
addressed as part of a broader scope evaluation of the pressure vessel 
regulations and are not part of this proposed amendment.

Reasons for the Proposed Changes 


The needs for these proposed amendments to the fracture toughness 
regulations have been identified from three sources: 



1. The 1989 Nuclear Utility Backfitting and Reform Group (NUBARG) 
appeal concerning use of nuclear heat to warm the RPV for system 
leakage and hydrostatic pressure tests; 
2. The 1990 review of the RPV integrity of the Yankee Nuclear Power 
Station; and 
3. A comprehensive review of the regulations by NRC staff, resulting 
in the identification of the need for clarifications, corrections, 
and improved guidance in certain areas. 



The recognition in 1986 by NRC staff that certain boiling water reactor 
(BWR) units were using nuclear heat to warm the system prior to performing 
leakage and pressure tests led to an NRC staff initiative to amend Appendix G 
to 10 CFR Part 50. During the NRC staff review to determine if this use of 
nuclear heating was permissible under either the ASME Code or the NRC 
regulations, the Nuclear Utility Backfitting and Reform Group (NUBARG) filed a 
backfitting claim, and later an appeal of the determination that a backfit was 
not involved. Stemming from this claim and appeal process, the Committee to 
Review Generic Requirements recommended to the Executive Director for 
Operations that the affected portions of Appendix G be revised to clearly 
indicate that all required leakage and pressure tests of the reactor pressure 
vessel must be performed when the core is not critical. 
In 1990, the NRC began a review of the integrity of the Yankee Nuclear 
Power Station (YNPS) RPV. That review, along with stated plans by the 
licensee to consider thermal annealing of the RPV, highlighted the need for 
the NRC to amend its regulations and guidance pertaining to RPV integrity. 
The NRC staff proposed a plan to revise and clarify the pertinent regulations 
in SECY-91-333 (October 22, 1991) and SECY-92-283 (August 14, 1992), including 
schedules and general descriptions of the changes contemplated. The proposed 
changes included clarifications and corrections planned prior to the YNPS 
review. However, the YNPS review identified the need to clarify the 
requirements in Sections IV and V of Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50, and the 
need to provide more complete requirements and guidance for thermal annealing. 
The PTS rule, 10 CFR 50.61, was amended on May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22300) to 
make the method for evaluating irradiation embrittlement consistent with the 
recommended procedures of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, ``Radiation 
Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials.'' Subsequent inquiries to the 
Commission concerning the appropriate margin terms and use of surveillance 
data indicated that the PTS rule required clarification. A recent review of 
the rule by NRC staff concluded that the PTS rule should also be modified to 
bring the procedures for evaluating RTPTS into complete agreement with the 
recommended procedures in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. 


Overview of the Proposed Changes 


PTS Rule (10 CFR 50.61) 


The pressurized thermal shock rule, 10 CFR 50.61, was initially 
published in final form on July 23, 1985 (50 FR 29937) and amended on May 15, 
1991 (56 FR 22300). This rule provides a screening criterion for irradiation 
embrittlement of RPV beltline materials, above which the plant cannot continue 
to be operated without justification. Historically, a value of reference 
temperature has been determined for each vessel beltline material for 
comparison to the PTS screening criteria. These values of reference 
temperature are termed RT

PTS

 values. However, the method for evaluating RT

PTS

 values has not been consistent with the embrittlement estimates used for other 
purposes, such as pressure-temperature limit calculations. The May 15, 1991, 
amendment was a step towards unifying the embrittlement estimate methodology. 
The amendment included the procedures given in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 
2, for the evaluation of irradiation embrittlement of the RPV beltline 
materials. The 1991 amendment left two differences between the rule and 
Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. These two differences are: 
1. Values of unirradiated RT

NDT

 are specified for general classes of 
material in the PTS rule, while greater flexibility in determining 
unirradiated values is permitted in Regulatory Guide 1.99, 
Revision 2; and 
2. The margin terms used in the PTS rule are based on assumptions which 
are not consistent with the method used in Regulatory Guide 1.99, 
Revision 2 for calculating the margin term. 
This proposed amendment is intended to make the evaluation of RT

PTS

 
consistent with the recommended methods of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, 
which are used to evaluate RT

NDT

. In this case, the RT

PTS

 value for each 
vessel beltline material is simply the RT

NDT

 value estimated for the projected 
end of license fluence. 
This proposed amendment to the PTS rule would make three changes: 
1. The Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, method for determining RT

NDT

, 
of which RT

PTS

 is a unique value determined for the end of license 
fluence, would be incorporated in total, including treatment of the 
unirradiated RT

NDT

 value, the margin term, and the explicit 
definition of ``credible'' surveillance data. 
2. The section would be restructured to improve clarity, with the 
requirements section giving only the requirements for the RT

PTS

 
value. The method for calculating RT

PTS

 would be moved to a new 
paragraph of the rule.

<TEXT>
 

3. Thermal annealing would be introduced as a method for mitigating the effects of neutron irradiation, thereby reducing
RT

PTS

. 

Additionally, it should be noted that evaluations of current surveillance data have indicated that the standard
deviation of the differences between predicted and measured shifts in RT

NDT

, termed the residual, are higher than the margin values used in the PTS rule and in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision
2, particularly for plate materials. However, the mean embrittlement estimation equations in the rule and in Regulatory
Guide 1.99, Revision 2, overestimate the actual surveillance data by less than 10
 F on average. The NRC staff considered amending the PTS rule to incorporate the revised margin terms and the overestimation
bias, but decided against such an amendment due to the small number of plants that would be affected by such a change,
and a related NRC research program that addresses the overall issue of irradiation embrittlement correlations.
The number of plants which would have their RT

PTS

 values change ``significantly'' by such a change to the margin terms is not large; the impact of the revised margin
terms on those plants is being addressed through other regulatory mechanisms. The effect of the revised margin on
pressure-temperature limits is being handled in a similar manner. 

As noted, this proposed amendment to 10 CFR 50.61 introduces thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel beltline
as a method for mitigating the effects of neutron irradiation and reducing RT

PTS

 to levels below the screening criteria. As specified in  50.61(b)(7) of this proposed rule, the use of thermal
annealing would be subject to the requirements of the proposed new section on thermal annealing (10 CFR 50.66). 



Thermal Annealing Rule (10 CFR 50.66) 



The proposed thermal annealing rule, 10 CFR 50.66, would provide a consistent set of requirements for the use of thermal
annealing to mitigate the effects of neutron irradiation. The proposed rule would replace the requirements for annealing
in the current Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50 with the proposed consistent set of requirements in this proposed rule. Also,
the PTS rule would be amended to add a new paragraph (b)(7) which would reference the proposed thermal annealing rule
as a method for mitigating the effects of neutron irradiation, thereby reducing RT

PTS

. Therefore, the intent of the thermal annealing rule, and related changes in 10 CFR 50.61 and Appendix G of 10 CFR Part
50, is to provide requirements for use of thermal annealing to mitigate the deleterious effects of neutron irradiation
on reactor vessel material properties. 

Consistent with guidance in Section V.D of the current Appendix G, the proposed thermal annealing rule would specify
that thermal annealing would be subject to the approval of the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR).
Section 50.66(a) of the proposed thermal annealing rule would require submittal of an application containing three
sections: a thermal annealing operating plan, a requalification inspection and test program, and a fracture toughness
recovery and reembrittlement rate assurance program. This application would be required to be submitted at least
three years before the proposed date of the annealing operation. This three-year period is specified only to provide
NRC staff with sufficient time to review the thermal annealing application. The licensee may initiate the thermal
annealing program as soon as NRC approval is given, even if this approval is given before three years from the date of
the application. 

The thermal annealing operating plan also must include an evaluation of the effects of temperature, and of mechanical
and thermal stresses on the reactor and associated equipment to demonstrate that the operability of the reactor will
not be detrimentally affected. The temperatures and times used in this analysis define the proposed annealing conditions.
If these conditions are exceeded during the vessel annealing, then the evaluation would no longer be valid, and the
acceptability of the actual vessel annealing would have to be demonstrated. 

Upon completion of the thermal annealing and before subsequent operation of the plant, the licensee would be required
to certify that the thermal annealing was performed in accordance with the approved application, that the approved
criteria were satisfied, and that the proposed annealing conditions were not exceeded. However, in the event that
the licensee cannot make this certification, a justification for subsequent operation would have to be submitted
for approval by the Director, NRR. However, this provision does not relieve the licensee from obtaining 10 CFR 50.12
exemptions from any other requirements of this part that cannot be satisfied. 

Two items of particular importance to the overall annealing are the recovery of fracture toughness and the rate of
reembrittlement of the RPV beltline materials. This proposed rule provides three alternative methods for determining
these values, ranging from assessments using plant-specific materials to an assessment using a generic computation.


Two methods for evaluating annealing recovery are experimental methods to determine plant-specific annealing
recovery, and the third method is a generic computational method. The first method would be required for those plants
with ``credible'' surveillance programs and where surveillance specimens are available. The second method would
be an optional method, in which the licensee may remove material from the beltline of the RPV to evaluate annealing
recovery. This method should provide the most accurate evaluation of annealing recovery. Presumably, it would be
selected for those plants without credible surveillance programs or when surveillance specimens are not available.
However, for this method to be acceptable, the vessel must be sufficiently thick so that the stress limits in Section
III of the ASME Code can be satisfied, considering the effects of fatigue and corrosion. 

The third method would use generic computational methods, for which appropriate justification would be required.


Paragraph (d) of  50.66 describes the experimental methods and the computational method for estimating recovery
of RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy of the beltline materials. The experimental methods for estimating recovery of RT

NDT

 and the Charpy upper-shelf energy utilize either surveillance program specimens or material removed from the vessel
beltline. The experimental methods provide a plant-specific estimate of recovery, rather than the generic value
evaluated from the computational method. It is the intent of this proposed rule to require that surveillance specimens
from ``credible'' surveillance programs must be used to develop plant-specific recovery data, if such specimens
are available. It is not the intent of this rule to require the removal of material from the RPV beltline to permit plant-specific
evaluation of recovery.

As described previously, the computational method would require appropriate justification. 

Reembrittlement trends are estimated, and monitored by continued surveillance in accordance with Appendix H of
10 CFR Part 50. 

Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) provides that the reembrittlement rate must be monitored using a surveillance program which
conforms to Appendix H of this part. Some older plants conform to Appendix H by applying issues of ASTM Standard E 185
that do not require the use of the vessel ``limiting materials'' in the surveillance program. Within this context,
the term ``limiting materials'' refers to the materials predicted to have the highest RT

NDT

 or the lowest Charpy upper shelf energy during the operational lifetime of the plant. It is the intent of this rule that,
as required by later issues of ASTM Standard E 185, the vessel ``limiting materials'' should be used to monitor reembrittlement
if the materials are available. 



Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50 



Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50 specifies fracture toughness requirements for ferritic materials of pressure-retaining
components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary of light-water-cooled nuclear power reactors. These requirements
provide adequate margins of safety during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational
occurrences and system hydrostatic tests. The proposed amendments to Appendix G are principally of a clarifying
or a restructuring nature. These amendments include: 

1. Sections IV and V of Appendix G which would be combined and rewritten to clarify the Charpy upper-shelf energy requirements,
and the pressure-temperature and minimum permissible temperature requirements. 

2. An explicit statement that would be added to Section IV requiring that pressure and leak tests of the reactor pressure
vessel required by Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler & Pressure Vessel (B&PV)
Code (ASME Code) must be completed before the core is critical. 

3. The proposed thermal annealing rule, 10 CFR 50.66, that would be referenced in lieu of the details on thermal annealing
previously given in Section V.D. 

4. The reference to the ASME Code that would be changed from Appendix G of Section III to Appendix G of Section XI of the
ASME Code. 

5. The ``design to permit annealing'' requirement (Section IV.B), which would be deleted. 

The restructuring of Sections IV and V is intended to promote clarity of the requirements in these sections. The procedures
required for cases in which the Charpy upper-shelf energy of a RPV beltline material falls below 50 ft-lb also would
be clarified by consolidating the requirements previously addressed in parts of Sections IV and V. 

The provisions in Section V.C concerning requirements for ``volumetric inspection'' and ``additional evidence
of fracture toughness'' would be removed. The volumetric examination requirement would be removed because it was
unnecessary, given the inspection and performance demonstration programs currently required under 10 CFR 50.55a.
The ``additional evidence of fracture toughness'' requirement in Section V.C.2 would be incorporated in the ``equivalent
margins'' analysis in Section IV.A.1, as a provisional method for developing fracture toughness data needed for
that analysis. At the present time there is an adequate generic fracture toughness data base available to perform
these analyses, with appropriate bounding considerations. The modification would permit a licensee to develop
plant-specific data. Generally, plant-specific data would result in a reduction in the margin applied to the fracture
toughness data, to reflect the reduction in uncertainties due to the availability of plant-specific data. However,
this must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 

The pressure-temperature and minimum permissible temperature requirements in Section IV would be restructured,
with the principal feature being the addition of a table which summarizes the pressure-temperature limit requirements
and minimum temperature requirements as a function of the plant operating condition, the vessel pressure, whether
fuel is in the vessel, and whether the core is critical. In addition, Section IV would be reworded to clarify the minimum
permissible temperature requirement by indicating the criteria for use in determining the location in the component
or material which must satisfy the minimum temperature requirement. This minimum temperature is defined in Section
IV as the metal temperature of the controlling material in the region which has the least favorable combination of
stress and temperature for the appropriate plant condition. 

The requirement that all pressure and leak tests of the RPV required by Section XI of the ASME Code must be completed
before the core is critical is intended to prohibit the use of nuclear heat, i.e., core criticality, before the completion
of these tests. The use of nuclear heat before the completion of such tests is considered unsafe for several reasons,
including the hindrance of finding leaks with the vessel at such a high temperature and the potential for exacerbating
the consequences of a vessel rupture (in the extremely unlikely event that it should occur) by having the core critical.
The explicit prohibition of nuclear heat in these cases was recommended to the Executive Director for Operations
by the Committee to Review Generic Requirements in a memorandum dated June 7, 1990. 

The requirements on thermal annealing contained in the current Appendix G (Section V.D) would be replaced by a reference
to the proposed Thermal Annealing rule, 10 CFR 50.66. 

Changing the reference to Appendix G of the ASME Code from Section III to Section XI means that the requirements for
operating plants will no longer come from the construction code (Section III of the ASME Code) but instead will come
from Section XI, the in-service inspection code. Appendix G to Section XI and Appendix G to Section III are identical,
so this amendment would not result in a change in technical requirements. 


Section IV.B of Appendix G requires that: 

``Reactor vessels for which the predicted value of upper-shelf energy at end of life is below 50 ft-lb or for which the
predicted value of adjusted reference temperature at end of life exceeds 200 
 F (93 
 C) must be designed to permit a thermal annealing treatment * * *'' 

This proposed rule would delete that requirement. This deletion conforms with Commission direction from 1985 and
public comments to delete this section. An additional consideration to delete this requirement is that there should
be no requirement to ensure the feasibility of a (future) voluntary activity.

During the Commission review of the revision of Appendix G published 
final on May 27, 1983 (48 FR 24009), the requirement to ``design to permit 
annealing'' was criticized because licensee response to the requirement was 
perfunctory and staff review of the responses was cursory, as detailed in 
SECY-83-254 (June 27, 1983). Further, there were no criteria to assess 
whether a design would permit annealing. An additional problem cited with the 
requirement was that it was misinterpreted to mean that plant operation with 
an RT

NDT

 greater than 200
 F or a Charpy upper-shelf energy below 50 ft-lb was 
unsafe. The Commission indicated that it would seek public comments on the 
proposed deletion of the requirement, and this was done concurrently with the 
publication of the proposed PTS rule on February 4, 1984 (49 FR 4498). All 
sixteen of the commenters on this item recommended deletion of the paragraph, 
although eight of them urged that the deletion should not in any way imply 
that annealing is no longer an option to increase safety margins. In the 
notice of final rulemaking for the PTS rule published on July 23, 1985 
(50 FR 29944), the ``Supplementary Information'' noted that the Commission 
planned a separate rulemaking action to delete Section IV.B. That planned 
deletion was delayed so that it could be combined with other amendments to 
Appendix G. 


Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50 


Changes in the fracture toughness properties of the RPV beltline 
materials due to irradiation embrittlement are monitored using a surveillance 
program, as required in Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50, ``Reactor Vessel Material 
Surveillance Program Requirements''. Appendix H references American Society 
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard E 185 (``Standard Practice for 
Conducting Surveillance Tests for Light-Water Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor 
Vessels'') for many of the detailed requirements of surveillance programs, and 
permits the use of integrated surveillance programs, wherein surveillance 
program capsules for one reactor are irradiated in another reactor. This 
proposed amendment would make the following changes: 



1. End the provision for ``reducing the amount of testing'' for 
integrated surveillance programs, 
2. Restructure the section on requirements for integrated 
surveillance programs (Section II.C), and 
3. Clarify the version of ASTM Standard E 185 that applies to the 
surveillance program. 



Integrated surveillance programs are permitted under Section II.C of 
Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50. One provision of this section is that ``the 
amount of testing may be reduced if the initial results agree with 
predictions.'' It is proposed to discontinue this provision as of the 
effective date of the Appendix, although previous authorizations granted by 
the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, would continue in effect. 
A second proposed change to Appendix H restructures Section II.C to 
clarify the requirements for integrated surveillance programs. 
The other principal change to Appendix H clarifies the version of ASTM 
Standard E 185 that applies to the various portions of the surveillance 
programs. Appendix H recognizes the need to separate surveillance programs 
into two essential parts, specifically the design of the program, and 
subsequent testing and reporting of results from the surveillance capsules. 
Since the design of the surveillance program cannot be changed once the 
program is in place, the requirements for design of the surveillance program 
are static for each plant. However, the testing and reporting requirements 
are updated along with technical improvements made to ASTM standard E 185. 
The clarification proposed in this revision indicates that the design of the 
program and the withdrawal schedule must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185-73, or the edition of ASTM E 185 that
is current on the issue date of the ASME 
Code to which the reactor vessel was purchased, whichever is latest. 
Licensees could choose to comply with later editions of ASTM E 185, up through 
the 1982 edition. Further, specimen test procedures and reporting 
requirements must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185-82 ``to the extent 
practicable for the configuration of the specimens in the capsule.'' 
The NRC staff intended that this proposed amendment to Appendix H would 
incorporate by reference a version of ASTM standard E 185 updated from the 
currently available 1982 version. However, that standardization process has 
not been completed, and it was decided to proceed with this proposed 
amendment. A subsequent amendment to Appendix H will be considered after the 
NRC staff has reviewed the updated ASTM standard. 


Request for Public Comments 


On June 13, 1994 (SECY-94-163) the staff requested Commission approval 
to publish for public comment these proposed revisions and provided a 
discussion of options for public participation related to thermal annealing. 
The Commission approved issuance of the proposed revisions but directed that 
the staff to (1) include with the proposed rule package a discussion of 
options the staff has considered for structuring of the regulatory process for 
the proposed thermal annealing rule (10 CFR 50.66), which is included in the 
following section, and (2) request comments on the following issues related to 
the proposed regulation on thermal annealing: 



1. The technical adequacy of the staff's guidance; 
2. The sufficiency of the guidance and criteria to support a 
certification that if satisfied, a plant with an annealed vessel 
can safely resume operation; 
3. Whether health and safety concerns are best served by approval of 
the thermal annealing plan or of readiness for restart; 
4. The preferred regulatory process (including opportunities for 
public participation) and the commenter's basis for recommending a 
particular process; and 
5. Whether there are health and safety issues concerning thermal 
annealing that cannot be addressed generically and would warrant 
plant-specific consideration. 



Options the Staff Has Considered for Structuring of the Regulatory Process 
Related to Public Participation in Thermal Annealing 


A significant issue with respect to thermal annealing, identified in 
SECY-92-283 (August 14, 1992), is the nature and timing of public 
participation related to the NRC's review and approval of a licensee's 
proposal for thermal annealing. The proposed rule does not address public 
participation per se, but instead provides the performance requirements that a 
licensee would have to meet to gain NRC approval of a thermal annealing 
application and to permit subsequent operation. Under the proposed rule, 
there are three circumstances that arguably require an opportunity for hearing 
pursuant to Section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) in connection 
with NRC review and approval of thermal annealing. First, a licensee seeking 
to anneal its reactor vessel must obtain NRC approval of the content of the 
thermal annealing plan prior to implementing the plan (see  50.66(a) of 
the proposed rule). Second, and apart from the NRC approval required under 
 50.66(a), the thermal annealing process as described in the licensee's 
plan may necessitate license amendments (including technical specification 
changes). License amendments may be required if the licensee's final safety 
analysis report (FSAR) needs to be revised to reflect the thermal annealing 
process, and the licensee is unable to conclude that such FSAR changes do not 
constitute ``unreviewed safety questions'' under 10 CFR 50.59. Implementation 
of the thermal annealing plan may also violate existing technical 
specifications, necessitating requests for changes to technical 
specifications. Any license amendment and technical specification change must 
be approved by the NRC before the licensee may implement the thermal annealing 
plan. Finally, after the licensee implements the annealing plan, if he 
determines that he cannot meet the criteria specified in  50.66(c)(1) 
of the proposed rule, then NRC approval is needed in order for the licensee to 
resume operation (see  50.66(c)(2) of the proposed rule).

It is clear that any license amendments and technical specification 
changes necessitated by the thermal annealing plan would require an 
opportunity for hearing, in accordance with Section 189 of the AEA. However, 
the scope of such a hearing would normally be limited to consideration of 
whether the proposed license amendment and technical specification changes are 
in accordance with the Commission's rules, and therefore provide reasonable 
assurance of adequate protection to the public health and safety. Issues 
related to the more general matter of the acceptability of the thermal 
annealing plan proposed by the licensee would not fall within the scope of any 
hearing for license amendment or technical specification change, except as 
they fall directly in the scope of the requested amendment or technical 
specification change. 
However, there is some question whether the AEA requires an opportunity 
for hearing in connection with the NRC approval of the thermal annealing plan 
or the NRC decision approving resumption of operation under the proposed rule. 
There are four primary alternatives with respect to providing an opportunity 
for hearing in connection with thermal annealing. These alternatives are 
discussed in greater detail below: 


Alternative 1. No Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed 


Under this alternative, the contention is that Section 189 of the AEA 
does not afford an interested member of the public a right to request a 
hearing in connection with NRC approvals of thermal annealing plans and 
resumption of operation under  50.66(c)(2). This alternative is 
consistent with other provisions in 10 CFR Part 50 where approval by the 
Director of NRR is required and hearings are not routinely offered. 
Notwithstanding the lack of a requirement for a public hearing, the 
staff anticipates that, with respect to the initial or the first several 
applications for thermal annealing, several informal hearings or public 
meetings would be held by the staff to permit discussion of both the thermal 
annealing plan proposed by the licensee and the technical issues related to 
annealing. These hearings or meetings would ensure that all of the pertinent 
technical issues have been addressed by the licensee in its thermal annealing 
plan and by the staff in its review of the plan. These hearings or meetings 
would be noticed in the 

Federal Register

. 


Alternative 2. Discretionary Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed 


Under this alternative, the contention is that Section 189 of the AEA 
does not afford an interested member of the public a right to request a 
hearing. However, as a matter of discretion, the Commission would determine 
on a case-by-case basis whether an opportunity for hearing will be provided in 
connection with the Director of NRR's determination on a thermal annealing 
application under  50.66(b) of the proposed rule. In the hearing, the 
Commission would consider issues related to the adequacy of the thermal 
annealing plan, as well as the vessel's ability to perform its safety function 
after being annealed. 
A case-by-case determination would also be made by the NRC with respect 
to providing an opportunity for hearing on the Director of NRR's determination 
on the licensee's justification for subsequent operation under the proposed 
 50.66(c)(2). 
In both cases, the Commission would publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the NRC's approval of the licensee's thermal annealing 
plan or approval of resumed operation under  50.66(c)(2). Neither 
implementation of the thermal annealing plan nor resumption of operation, once 
approved by the NRC, would be contingent upon completion of any hearing; i.e., 
the Commission does not believe that it is required to make a Section 189 ``no 
significant hazards determination'' (``Sholly finding'') when it provides a 
discretionary hearing. 


Alternative 3. Required Opportunity for Hearing Under Rule as Proposed 


Under this alternative, the contention is that a hearing is required by 
Section 189 of the AEA for both NRC's approval of the thermal annealing plan 
and any NRC approval of resumed operation following annealing. The adequacy 
of the thermal annealing plan, as well as the vessel's ability to perform its 
safety function after being annealed, could be raised in the hearing 
associated with approval of the thermal annealing plan. Licensee 
implementation of the thermal annealing plan could not commence until any 
hearing is concluded unless the NRC makes a ``no significant hazards 
determination'' with respect to the thermal annealing. 


Alternative 4. Modify Proposed Rule to Require Suspension of License Prior 
to Thermal Annealing 


Under this alternative, the proposed rule's regulatory approach for 
thermal annealing would be modified to include a suspension of the operating 
license during thermal annealing. The suspension would be automatic under the 
rule, without the need for a suspension order, although a letter confirming 
the licensee's status under the annealing rule would be prepared. The rule 
itself, as is currently drafted, would specify the conditions for lifting of 
the suspension (Section 50.66(b)). The licensee would anneal its reactor 
vessel without prior NRC approval of its program for conducting the annealing. 
Upon completion, the suspension would be lifted only if the licensee 
demonstrated that the thermal annealing has addressed the reactor 
enbrittlement such that it is acceptable to operate the plant. There would be 
no opportunity for hearing associated with the lifting of the suspension, and 
since there would be no prior NRC approval of the annealing program, a hearing 
opportunity under Section 189 would not be implicated by any such approval. 


Submission of Comments in Electronic Format 


Commenters are encouraged to submit, in addition to the original paper 
copy, a copy of the letter in electronic format on a DOS-formatted (IBM 
compatible) 5.25 or 3.5 inch computer diskette. Text files should be provided 
in WordPerfect format or unformatted ASCII code. The format and version 
should be identified on the diskette's external label. 


Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact


The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 
CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of human environment and, therefore, an 
environmental impact statement is not required. 
As discussed below, the individual actions covered in this proposed 
rulemaking would either serve to enhance safety of the reactor pressure 
vessel, thereby decreasing the environmental impact of plant operation, or 
have no impact on the environment. Therefore, in all cases these individual 
actions will not have an adverse impact on the environment. 


PTS Rule (10 CFR 50.61) 


The inclusion of thermal annealing as an option for mitigating the 
effects of neutron irradiation would serve to decrease the environmental 
impact of plant operation by enhancing the safety of the reactor pressure 
vessel.

The incorporation of the Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, method for 
determining RT

NDT 

into the PTS rule would have no impact on the environment 
because this change will result in values of RT

PTS

 which are consistent with 
those currently used in plant operation. 

The restructuring of the PTS rule is the type of action described in 
categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, an environmental 
assessment is not necessary for this change. 



Thermal Annealing Rule (10 CFR 50.66) 



The proposed thermal annealing rule (10 CFR 50.66) would permit and 
provide requirements for the thermal annealing of a reactor vessel to restore 
fracture properties of the reactor vessel material which have been degraded by 
neutron irradiation. This rule does not affect all plants but provides an 
alternative for assuring compliance with the requirements in 10 CFR 50.61 and 
Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50, and would only apply when a licensee elects to 
use it. 

The application of thermal annealing to a reactor vessel would improve 
the condition of the reactor vessel material. In addition, this rule would 
establish requirements to avoid damaging the reactor system and to protect 
against accidents during the annealing operation, with attendant environmental 
consequences. 

This rule is one of several regulatory requirements that will function 
to ensure reactor vessel integrity. In that sense, this rule would have a 
positive impact on the environment by reducing the potential for vessel 
failure. For these reasons, the Commission has determined that there would be 
no significant impact and, therefore, an environmental statement is not 
required. 



Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50 



Concerning the amendments proposed to Appendix G of 10 CFR Part 50, the 
prohibition of core criticality before completion of the required pressure and 
leak tests will serve to reduce the potential for vessel failure, and thereby 
decrease the environmental impact of plant operation. 

The restructuring of Sections IV and V of Appendix G is clarifying or 
corrective in nature, and hence is the type of action described in categorical 
exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, an environmental assessment is not 
necessary for this change. 

The changing of the reference from Appendix G of Section III of the ASME 
Code to Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code has no impact on the 
environment since the requirements in the Appendices are identical. 
Therefore, there is no adverse impact on the environment from this change. 

The referencing of the thermal annealing rule results in no adverse 
impact on the environment since Appendix G currently permits the use of 
thermal annealing to reduce fracture toughness loss of the RPV materials due 
to irradiation embrittlement. 

The deletion of the ``design to permit annealing'' requirement has no 
adverse impact on the environment. This assessment is based on the fact that 
annealing is a voluntary activity. 



Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50 



Concerning the amendments proposed to Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50, the 
requirement that all irradiation surveillance tests be made (i.e., no 
reduction in testing is permitted) would have a positive impact on the 
environment in helping to assure the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel. 

The restructuring of Section II.C is the type of action described in 
categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, an environmental 
assessment is not necessary for this change. 

The clarification of the applicable version of ASTM Standard E 185 will 
result in no adverse impact to the environment since there will be no change 
to current surveillance programs. Changes to future surveillance programs 
will make the programs more effective in assessing irradiation embrittlement 
effects to the RPV materials, thereby helping to assure the integrity of the 
reactor pressure vessel. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are 
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This 
rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and 
approval of the paperwork requirements. 

The public reporting burden for this collection of information is 
estimated to average 6,000 hours per respondent, including the time for 
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and 
maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect 
of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden to the Information and Records Management Branch (T-6 F33), U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555; and to the Desk 
Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-3019, (3150-0011), 
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503. 



Regulatory Analysis 



The NRC staff has prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed 
amendments to 10 CFR 50.61, 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G and 10 CFR Part 50 
Appendix H, which describes the factors and alternatives considered by the 
Commission in deciding to propose these amendments. A copy of the regulatory 
analysis is available for inspection and copying for a fee at the NRC Public 
Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555. Single 
copies of the analysis may be obtained from Alfred Taboada, Office of Nuclear 
Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, 
telephone, (301) 415-6014. 

Single copies of the regulatory analysis prepared for 10 CFR 50.66 may 
be obtained from Alfred Taboada, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone, 
(301) 415-6014. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the 
Commission certifies that, if adopted, the proposed amendments would not have 
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The 
rules which would be affected by the proposed amendments: (1) Preclude 
brittle fracture of embrittled vessels during PTS events, (2) provide the 
general fracture toughness requirements for RPVs, including ductile fracture 
toughness requirements and pressure-temperature limits, (3) provide the 
requirements for surveillance programs to monitor irradiation embrittlement of 
RPV beltline materials, and (4) provide for a method for restoring the 
fracture toughness of RPV beltline materials used in nuclear facilities 
licensed under the provision of 10 CFR 50.21(b) and 10 CFR 50.22. The 
companies that own these facilities do not fall within the scope of the 
definition of ``small entities'' as set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards
in regulations issued by the Small 
Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121. 



Backfit Analysis 



PTS Rule (10 CFR 50.61) 



The proposed revision to Section 50.61 would require licensees to 
calculate RT

PTS

 using the same methodology specified in Regulatory Guide 1.99, 
Revision 2 for determining RT

NDT

. This proposal is logically a requisite part 
of the 1991 revisions to  50.61, which addressed a unified method for 
calculating radiation enbrittlement of the reactor beltline materials. 
However, the Commission inadvertently failed to make the conforming change to 
 50.61. Therefore, the Commission believes that the backfit statement for the 
1991 amendments, which determined that the backfits were necessary to ensure 
that the facility provides adequate protection to the public health and 
safety, are applicable to this conforming change to  50.61. 

The restructuring of the PTS rule does not impose any backfits as 
defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), since there is no change in requirements due 
to this restructuring. 

The inclusion of thermal annealing does not impose any backfits as 
defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), for the reasons set forth below in ``Thermal 
Annealing Rule (10 CFR 50.66).''

Thermal Annealing Rule (10 CFR 50.66) 



The proposed thermal annealing rule would establish new requirements 
with respect to applications for thermal annealing. However, the Commission 
has determined that the proposed rule would not impose a ``backfit'' as defined 
in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). The proposed thermal annealing rule would not require 
any licensee to perform thermal annealing. Under existing requirements, all 
licensees are required to evaluate whether they exceed the PTS screening 
limits in 10 CFR 50.61 and the Charpy upper shelf screening limits in 10 CFR 
Part 50, Appendix G. However, these rules provide an alternative means to 
meet these screening limits, 

viz.

, performing thermal annealing. No licensee currently has pending before the NRC an application for thermal annealing,
nor has any current licensee been granted permission to conduct thermal annealing. In addition, the proposed rule
does not reflect any new or different Staff position which conflicts with a prior Staff position or Commission rule.
Thus, the proposed rule would have a purely prospective effect on future applications for thermal annealing. The
Commission has stated in other rulemakings establishing prospective requirements, 

e.g.

, 10 CFR Part 52 and the License Renewal Rule, 10 CFR Part 54, that the Backfit Rule was not intended to protect the future
applicant from current changes in Commission requirements when there are no prior NRC positions upon which the ``substantial
increase in overall protection'' can be measured. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the proposed rule
does not impose backfits and a backfit analysis need not be prepared for the proposed thermal annealing rule. 



10 CFR Part 50 Appendix G 



The restructuring of Sections IV and V of this appendix, referencing of 
the thermal annealing rule, changing the reference from Appendix G of 
Section III of the ASME Code to Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code, and 
deleting the ``design to permit annealing'' requirement do not impose any 
backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), because they are either 
prospective in nature or of a clarifying nature. 

The explicit prohibition on core criticality before the completion of 
pressure and leak tests can be construed as a backfit, although NRC staff 
intent was never to permit such a procedure (letter from J. M. Taylor, NRC, to 
N. S. Reynolds and D. F. Stenger, NUBARG, dated February 2, 1990). The 
Commission has concluded that any backfit requirements in this amendment are 
necessary to bring the facilities into compliance with licenses, or the rules 
and orders of the Commission, or into conformance with written commitments by 
the licensees. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not required pursuant to 
10 CFR 50.109(a)(4)(i). This amendment underscores the prior intent of the 
Commission to prohibit the use of nuclear heat before the completion of leak 
and pressure tests that is implicit in 10 CFR 50.55a and Section XI of the 
ASME Code. The Commission's intent in this regard is demonstrated by the fact 
that only a very small minority of licensees actually used nuclear heat to 
conduct pressure and leak tests required by the ASME Code. 



10 CFR Part 50 Appendix H 



The amendments to Appendix H of 10 CFR Part 50 are either prospective in 
nature or of a clarifying nature, and hence do not involve any provisions 
which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). 



Criminal Penalties 



For purposes of Section 223 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), the 
Commission proposes to issue the proposed rule under one or more of Sections 
161b, 161i or 161o of the AEA. Willful violations of the rule would be 
subject to criminal enforcement. 



List of Subjects

Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear power plants 
and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements.

2. Section 50.61 is revised to read as follows: 



 50.61 

Fracture toughness requirements for protection against pressurized thermal shock events. 



(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 

(1) 

ASME Code 

means the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Division I, ``Rules for the Construction 
of Nuclear Power Plant Components,'' edition and addenda and any limitations 
and modifications thereof as specified in  50.55a of this part. 

(2) 

Pressurized Thermal Shock Event 

means an event or transient in 
pressurized water reactors (PWRs) causing severe overcooling (thermal shock) 
concurrent with or followed by significant pressure in the reactor vessel. 

(3) 

Reactor Vessel Beltline 

means the region of the reactor vessel 
(shell material including welds, heat affected zones and plates or forgings) 
that directly surrounds the effective height of the active core and adjacent 
regions of the reactor vessel that are predicted to experience sufficient 
neutron radiation damage to be considered in the selection of the most 
limiting material with regard to radiation damage. 

(4) 

RT

NDT

 means the reference temperature for a reactor vessel material, 
under any conditions. For the reactor vessel beltline materials, RT

NDT

 must 
account for the effects of neutron radiation. 

(5) 

RT

NDT(U)

 means the reference temperature for a reactor vessel 
material in the pre-service or unirradiated condition, evaluated according to 
the procedures in the ASME Code, Paragraph NB-2331. 

(6) 

EOL Fluence 

means the best-estimate neutron fluence projected for a 
specific vessel beltline material at the clad-base-metal interface on the 
inside surface of the vessel at the location where the material receives the 
highest fluence on the expiration date of the operating license, the proposed 
expiration date if a change in the term of the operating license has been 
requested, or the end of a renewal term if an application for a renewed 
license under 10 CFR Part 54 has been submitted. 

(7) 

RT

PTS 

means the reference temperature, RT

NDT

, evaluated for the 
EOL Fluence for each of the vessel beltline materials, using the procedures of 
paragraph (c) of this section. 

(8) 

PTS Screening Criterion 

means the value of RT

PTS

 for the vessel 
beltline material above which the plant cannot continue to operate without 
justification. 

(b) Requirements. 

(1) For each pressurized water nuclear power reactor for which an 
operating license has been issued, the licensee shall have projected values of 
RT

PTS

, accepted by the NRC, for each reactor vessel beltline material for the 
EOL fluence of the material. The assessment of RT

PTS

 must use the calculative 
procedures given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section. The assessment must specify the 
bases for the projected value of RT

PTS

 for each vessel beltline material, 
including the assumptions regarding core loading patterns, and must specify 
the copper and nickel contents and the fluence value used in the calculation 
for each beltline material. This assessment must be updated whenever there is 
a significant
 change in projected values of RT

PTS

, or upon a request for a 
change in the expiration date for operation of the facility. 





(2) The pressurized thermal shock (PTS) screening criterion is 270
 F for 
plates, forgings, and axial weld materials, and 300
 F for circumferential weld 
materials. For the purpose of comparison with this criterion, the value of 
RT

PTS

 for the reactor vessel must be evaluated according to the procedures of 
paragraph (c) of this section, for each weld and plate, or forging, in the 
reactor vessel beltline. RT

PTS

 must be determined for each vessel beltline 
material using the EOL fluence for that material. 

(3) For each pressurized water nuclear power reactor for which the value 
of RT

PTS

 for any material in the beltline is projected to exceed the PTS 
screening criterion using the EOL fluence, the licensee shall implement those 
flux reduction programs that are reasonably practicable to avoid exceeding the 
PTS screening criterion set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The 
schedule for implementation of flux reduction measures may take into account 
the schedule for submittal and anticipated approval by the Director, Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, of detailed plant-specific analyses, submitted to 
demonstrate acceptable risk with RT

PTS

 above the screening limit due to plant 
modifications, new information or new analysis techniques. 

(4) For each pressurized water nuclear power reactor for which the 
analysis required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section indicates that no 
reasonably practicable flux reduction program will prevent RT

PTS

 from 
exceeding the PTS screening criterion using the EOL fluence, the licensee 
shall submit a safety analysis to determine what, if any, modifications to 
equipment, systems, and operation are necessary to prevent potential failure 
of the reactor vessel as a result of postulated PTS events if continued 
operation beyond the screening criterion is allowed. In the analysis, the 
licensee may determine the properties of the reactor vessel materials based on 
available information, research results, and plant surveillance data, and may 
use probabilistic fracture mechanics techniques. This analysis must be 
submitted at least three years before RT

PTS

 is projected to exceed the PTS 
screening criterion. 

(5) After consideration of the licensee's analyses, including effects of 
proposed corrective actions, if any, submitted in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation, may, on a case-by-case basis, approve operation of the facility 
with RT

PTS

 in excess of the PTS screening criterion. The Director, Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, will consider factors significantly affecting the 
potential for failure of the reactor vessel in reaching a decision. 

(6) If the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, concludes, 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, that operation of the facility 
with RT

PTS

 in excess of the PTS screening criterion cannot be approved on the 
basis of the licensee's analyses submitted in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, the licensee shall request and receive 
approval by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, prior to any 
operation beyond the criterion. The request must be based upon modifications 
to equipment, systems, and operation of the facility in addition to those 
previously proposed in the submitted analyses that would reduce the potential 
for failure of the reactor vessel due to PTS events, or upon further analyses 
based upon new information or improved methodology. 

(7) If the limiting RT

PTS

 value of the plant is projected to exceed the 
screening criteria in paragraph (b)(2), or the criteria in paragraphs (b)(3) 
through (b)(6) of this section cannot be satisfied, the reactor vessel 
beltline may be given a thermal annealing treatment to recover the fracture 
toughness of the material, subject to the requirements of  50.66. The 
reactor vessel may continue to be operated only for that service period within 
which the predicted fracture toughness of the vessel beltline materials 
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section, 
with RT

PTS

 accounting for the effects of annealing and subsequent irradiation.

(c) Calculation of RT

PTS

. RT

PTS

 must be evaluated using the same 
procedures used to calculate RT

NDT

, as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, and as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3). RT

PTS

 must be 
calculated for each vessel beltline material using a fluence value, f, which 
is the EOL fluence for the material. 

(1) Equation 1 must be used to calculate values of RT

NDT

 for each weld 
and plate, or forging, in the reactor vessel beltline. 








(i) 

RT

NDT(U)

 is the reference temperature, RT

NDT

, of the material in the 
pre-service or unirradiated condition, evaluated according to the procedures 
in the ASME Code, Paragraph NB-2331. 

(A) If a measured value of RT

NDT(U)

 is not available, a generic mean 
value for the class
 of material may be used if there are sufficient test 
results to establish a mean and a standard deviation for the class. 





(B) For weld metals, the following generic mean values must be used, 
unless justification for different values is provided: 0
 F for welds made with 
Linde 80 flux, and ^56
 F for welds made with Linde 0091, 1092 and 124 and 
ARCOS B-5 weld fluxes. 

(ii) 

M

 means the margin to be added to account for uncertainties in the 
values of RT

NDT(U)

, copper and nickel contents, fluence and the calculational 
procedures. M is evaluated from Equation 2. 








(A) In Equation 2, 

s

U

 is the standard deviation for RT

NDT(U)

. If a 
measured value of RT

NDT(U)

 is used, then 

s

U

 is determined from the precision 
of the test method. If a measured value of RT

NDT(U)

 is not available and a 
generic mean value for that class of materials is used, then 

s

U

 is the 
standard deviation obtained from the set of data used to establish the mean. 
If a generic mean value given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) for welds is used, 
then 

s

U

 is 17
 F. 

(B) In Equation 2, 

s

*

 is the standard deviation for 

*

RT

NDT

. The value 
of 

s

*

 to be used is 28
 F for welds and 17
 F for base metal; the value of 

s

*

 
shall not exceed one-half of 

*

RT

NDT

. 

(iii) 

*

RT

NDT

 is the mean value of the transition temperature shift, or 
change in RT

NDT

, due to irradiation, and must be calculated using Equation 3. 








(A) 

CF

 (
 F) is the chemistry factor, which is a function of copper and 
nickel content. CF is given in Table 1 for welds and in Table 2 for base 
metal (plates and forgings). Linear interpolation is permitted. In Tables 1 
and 2, ``Wt-% copper'' and ``Wt-% nickel'' are the best-estimate values for the 
material, which will normally be the mean of the measured values for a plate 
or forging. For a weld, the best estimate values will normally be the mean of 
the measured values for a weld deposit made using the same weld wire heat 
number as the critical vessel weld. If these values are not available, the 
upper limiting values given in the material specifications to which the vessel 
material was fabricated may be used. If not available, conservative estimates (mean plus one standard deviation)
based on generic data
 may be used if 
justification is provided. If none of these alternatives are available, 0.35% 
copper and 1.0% nickel must be assumed. 





(B) 

f

 is the best estimate neutron fluence, in units of 1019 n/cm2 
(E greater than 1 MeV), at the clad-base-metal interface on the inside surface 
of the vessel at the location where the material in question receives the 
highest fluence for the period of service in question. As specified in 
paragraph (c), the EOL fluence for the vessel beltline material is used in 
calculating RT

PTS

. 

(2) To verify that RT

NDT

 for each vessel beltline material is a bounding 
value for the specific reactor vessel, licensees shall consider plant-specific 
information that could affect the level of embrittlement. This information 
includes but is not limited to the reactor vessel operating temperature and 
surveillance program results. 

(i) Results from the plant-specific surveillance program must be 
integrated into the RT

NDT

 estimate if the plant-specific surveillance data has 
been deemed credible as judged by the following criteria: 

(A) The materials in the surveillance capsules must be those which are 
the controlling materials with regard to radiation embrittlement. 

(B) Scatter in the plots of Charpy energy versus temperature for the 
irradiated and unirradiated conditions must be small enough to permit the 
determination of the 30-foot-pound temperature unambiguously. 

(C) Where there are two or more sets of surveillance data from one 
reactor, the scatter of 

*

RT

NDT

 values must be less than 28
 F for welds and 
17
 F for base metal. Even if the range in the capsule fluences is large (two 
or more orders of magnitude), the scatter may not exceed twice those values. 

(D) The irradiation temperature of the Charpy specimens in the capsule 
must equal the vessel wall temperature at the cladding/base metal interface 
within 

#

25
 F. 

(E) The surveillance data for the correlation monitor material in the 
capsule must fall within the scatter band of the data base for the material. 

(ii) Surveillance data deemed credible according to the criteria of 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) must be used to determine a material-specific value of CF 
for use in Equation 3. A material-specific value of CF is determined from 
Equation 4. 








In Equation 4, ``n'' is the number of surveillance data points, ``A

i

'' is the 
measured value of 

*

RT

NDT

 and ``f

i

'' is the fluence for each surveillance data 
point. 



(iii) For cases in which the results from a credible plant-specific 
surveillance program are used, the value of 

s

*

 to be used is 14
 F for welds 
and 8.5
 F for base metal; the value of 

s

*

 may not exceed one-half of 

*

RT

NDT

. 

(iv) The use of results from the plant-specific surveillance program may 
result in an RT

NDT

 that is higher or lower than those determined in paragraph 
(c)(1). 

(3) Any information that is believed to improve the accuracy of the 
RT

PTS

 value significantly must be reported to the Director, Office of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation. Any value of RT

PTS

 that has been modified using the 
procedures of paragraph (c)(2) is subject to the approval of the Director, 
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation when used as provided in this section.

 50.66 

Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure vessel. 



(a) For those light water nuclear power reactors where neutron radiation has reduced the fracture toughness of the
reactor vessel materials, a thermal annealing treatment may be applied to the reactor vessel to restore the fracture
toughness to acceptable levels. The use of a thermal annealing treatment is subject to the approval of the Director,
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, and to the requirements in this section. The application for the Director's
approval must be submitted in accordance with  50.4, and at least three years prior to the proposed date of the
annealing operation.

 (b) Thermal Annealing Application. The content of the application for approval by the Director, Office of Nuclear
Reactor Regulation, for thermal annealing of the reactor vessel must include: a thermal annealing operating plan
that includes an evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses and temperatures, an inspection and
test program to requalify the annealed reactor vessel, and a program for demonstrating that the recovery of fracture
toughness and the re-embrittlement rate are adequate to permit subsequent safe operation of the reactor vessel for
the period specified in the application. 

(1) Thermal Annealing Operating Plan. 

(i) The thermal annealing operating plan must include: 

(A) A detailed description of the pressure vessel and all structures and components that will be affected by the thermal
annealing operation; 

(B) The methods, instrumentation and procedures proposed for performing 
the thermal annealing; 

(C) A description of the heat source to be used; and 

(D) The proposed thermal annealing operating parameters, including temperatures, times, and heatup and cooldown
schedules. 

(ii) The annealing time and temperature parameters selected must be based on projecting sufficient recovery of fracture
toughness, using the procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, to satisfy the requirements of  50.60 and
 50.61 for the proposed period of operation addressed in the application. In addition, the operating plan must
describe any special precautions necessary to minimize occupational exposure, in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably
Achievable (ALARA) principle and the provisions of  20.1206. 

(iii) An evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses and temperatures on the vessel, attached piping
and appurtenances, and adjacent equipment and components must demonstrate that operability of the reactor will
not be detrimentally affected. A detailed thermal and structural analysis must be performed to establish the time
and temperature profile of the annealing operation. These analyses must include heatup and cooldown rates, and must
demonstrate that localized temperatures, thermal stress gradients, and subsequent residual stresses will not
result in unacceptable dimensional changes or distortions in the vessel, attached piping and appurtenances, and
that the thermal annealing cycle will not result in unacceptable degradation of the fatigue life of these components.
The effects of localized high temperatures must be evaluated for degradation of the concrete adjacent to the vessel
and changes in thermal and mechanical properties of the reactor vessel insulation. If the design temperature limitations
for the adjacent concrete structure are to be exceeded during the annealing operation, an acceptable maximum temperature
for the concrete must be established for the annealing operation using appropriate test data. 

(iv) The time and temperature profile evaluated as part of the annealing operating plan, and supported by the evaluation
results of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, represents the proposed annealing conditions that may not be exceeded
during the annealing operation. If these conditions are exceeded, then the licensee cannot certify that the annealing
operation was performed in accordance with the approved application, as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
and must comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 

(v) The projected percent recovery of both RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined by the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, using
the proposed annealing time and temperature described in the operating plan. The projected post-anneal RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined from the projected percent recovery. 

(vi) The projected rate of reembrittlement of RT

NDT

 must be calculated using the procedures in  50.61(c), or must be the same rate as that used for the pre-anneal
operating period. The projected rate of reembrittlement for Charpy upper-shelf energy must be the same rate as that
used for the pre-anneal operating period. 

(2) Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The inspection and test program to requalify the annealed reactor
vessel must include the detailed monitoring, inspections, and tests proposed to demonstrate that the limitations
on temperatures, times and temperature profiles, and stresses evaluated for the proposed annealing conditions
of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section have not been exceeded, and to determine the annealing time and temperature
to be used in quantifying the fracture toughness recovery. In addition, the program must demonstrate that the annealing
operation has not degraded the reactor vessel, attached piping or appurtenances, or the adjacent concrete structures
to a degree that could affect the safe operation of the reactor. 

(3) Fracture Toughness Recovery and Reembrittlement Rate Assurance 
Program. The percent recovery of RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy obtained by the thermal annealing treatment must be determined from the time and temperature
of the actual vessel annealing. The recovery of RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy provide the basis for establishing the post-anneal RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy for each vessel material. Changes in the RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy with subsequent plant operation must be determined using the post-anneal values of
these parameters in conjunction with the projected reembrittlement rate determined in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3)(ii) of this section. 

(i) The recovery of RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be established using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, using the
time and temperature of the actual vessel annealing. 

(A) If the percent recovery is determined from testing surveillance specimens or from testing materials removed
from the reactor vessel, then it shall be demonstrated that the proposed annealing parameters used in the test program
are equal to or bounded by those used in the vessel annealing operation. 
(B) If generic computational methods are used, appropriate justification must be submitted as a part of the application.

(ii) The reembrittlement rate of both RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be estimated, and must be monitored using a surveillance program which conforms
to Appendix H of this part, ``Reactor Vessel Material Surveil- lance Program Requirements.'' 

(c) Certification of the Annealing Effectiveness. 

(1) Upon completion of the anneal and prior to re-start of the nuclear power plant, the licensee shall certify to the
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, that the thermal annealing was performed in accordance with the
approved application required by paragraph (a) of this section, and meets the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
section. In this certification, the licensee shall establish the period for which the reactor vessel will satisfy
the requirements of  50.60 and  50.61, and shall provide: 

(i) The post-anneal RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy values of the reactor vessel materials for use in subsequent reactor operation; 

(ii) The projected reembrittlement trends for both RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy; and 

(iii) The projected values of RT

PTS

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy at the end of the proposed period of operation addressed in the application. 

(2) If the licensee cannot certify that the thermal annealing was performed in accordance with the approved application
and the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee shall submit a justification for subsequent operation
for approval by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 

(d) Procedures for Determining the Recovery of Fracture Toughness. The procedures of this paragraph must be used
to determine the percent recovery of 

DRT

NDT

, R

t

, and percent recovery of Charpy upper-shelf energy, R

u

. In all cases, R

t

 and R

u

 may not exceed 100. 

(1) For those reactors with surveillance programs which have developed credible surveillance data as defined in
 50.61, percent recovery due to annealing (R

t

 and R

u

) must be evaluated by testing surveillance specimens that have been withdrawn from the surveillance program and
that have been annealed under the same time and temperature conditions as those given the beltline material. 

(2) Alternatively, the percent recovery due to annealing (R

t

 and R

u

) may be determined from the results of a verification test program employing materials removed from the beltline
region of the reactor vessel
 and that have been annealed under the same time and temperature conditions as those given the beltline material. 





(3) Generic computational methods may be used to determine recovery if 
adequate justification is provided. 

4. In 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G is revised to read as follows: 



Appendix G to Part 50_Fracture Toughness Requirements 



Table of Contents 



I. Introduction and Scope 

II. Definitions 

III. Fracture Toughness Tests 

IV. Fracture Toughness Requirements 



I. Introduction and Scope 



This appendix specifies fracture toughness requirements for ferritic materials of pressure-retaining components
of the reactor coolant pressure boundary of light water nuclear power reactors to provide adequate margins of safety
during any condition of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic
tests, to which the pressure boundary may be subjected over its service lifetime. 

The ASME Code forms the basis for the requirements of this appendix. ``ASME Code'' means the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. If no section is specified, the reference is to Section III, Division 1,
``Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power Plant Components.'' ``Section XI'' means Section XI, Division 1, ``Rules
for Inservice Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components.'' If no edition or addenda are specified, the ASME Code
edition and addenda and any limitations and modifications thereof, which are specified in  50.55a, are applicable.


The sections, editions and addenda of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code specified in  50.55a have been
approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the 

Federal Register

. A notice of any changes made to the material incorporated by reference will be published in the 

Federal Register

. Copies of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code may be purchased from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
United Engineering Center, 345 East 47th St., New York, NY 10017 and are available for inspection at the NRC Library,
11545 Rockville Pike, Two White Flint North, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738. 

The requirements of this appendix apply to the following materials: 

A. Carbon and low-alloy ferritic steel plate, forgings, castings, and pipe with specified minimum yield strengths
not over 50,000 psi (345 MPa), and to those with specified minimum yield strengths greater than 50,000 psi (345 MPa)
but not over 90,000 psi (621 MPa) if qualified by using methods equivalent to those described in paragraph G-2110
of Appendix G of Section XI of the latest edition and addenda of the ASME Code incorporated by reference into  50.55a(b)(2).


B. Welds and weld heat-affected zones in the materials specified in paragraph I.A. of this appendix. 

C. Materials for bolting and other types of fasteners with specified minimum yield strengths not over 130,000 psi

 The adequacy of the fracture toughness of other ferritic materials not covered in this section must be demonstrated
to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, on an individual case basis.

III. Fracture Toughness Tests 



A. To demonstrate compliance with the fracture toughness requirements of Section IV of this appendix, ferritic materials
must be tested in accordance with the ASME Code and, for the beltline materials, the test requirements of Appendix
H of this part. For a reactor vessel that was constructed to an ASME Code earlier than the Summer 1972 Addenda of the 1971
Edition (under  50.55a), the fracture toughness data and data analyses must be supplemented in a manner approved
by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, to demonstrate equivalence with the fracture toughness requirements
of this appendix. 

Test methods for supplemental fracture toughness tests described in 
paragraph IV.A.1.b of this appendix must be submitted to and approved by the 
Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, prior to testing. 

C. All fracture toughness test programs conducted in accordance with 
paragraphs III.A and III.B must comply with ASME Code requirements for 
calibration of test equipment, qualification of test personnel, and retention 
of records of these functions and of the test data. 



IV. Fracture Toughness Requirements 



The pressure-retaining components of the reactor coolant pressure 
boundary that are made of ferritic materials must meet the requirements of the 
ASME Code, supplemented by the additional requirements set forth below, for 
fracture toughness during system hydrostatic tests and any condition of normal 
operation, including anticipated operational occurrences. Reactor vessels may 
continue to be operated only for that service period within which the 
requirements of this section are satisfied. For the reactor vessel beltline 
materials, including welds, plates and forgings, the values of RT

NDT

 and Charpy upper-shelf energy must account for the effects of neutron radiation, including the results of the surveillance
program of Appendix H of this part. The effects of neutron radiation must consider the radiation conditions (i.e.,
the fluence) at the deepest point on the crack front of the flaw assumed in the analysis. 



1. Reactor Vessel Charpy Upper-Shelf Energy Requirements 



a. Reactor vessel beltline materials must have Charpy upper-shelf 
energy,
 in the transverse direction for base material and along the weld for 
weld material according to the ASME Code, of no less than 75 ft-lb (102 J) 
initially and must maintain Charpy upper-shelf energy throughout the life of 
the vessel of no less than 50 ft-lb (68 J), unless it is demonstrated in a 
manner approved by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, that 
lower values of Charpy upper-shelf energy will provide margins of safety 
against fracture equivalent to those required by Appendix G of Section XI of 
the ASME Code. This analysis must use the latest edition and addenda of the 
ASME Code incorporated by reference into  50.55a(b)(2) at the time the 
analysis is submitted. 





b. Additional evidence of the fracture toughness of the beltline 
materials after exposure to neutron irradiation may be obtained from results 
of supplemental fracture toughness tests, for use in the analysis specified in 
section IV.A.1.a. 

c. The analysis for satisfying the requirements of section IV.A.1 of 
this appendix must be submitted, as specified in  50.4, for review and 
approval on an individual case basis at least three years prior to the date 
when the predicted Charpy upper-shelf energy will no longer satisfy the 
requirements of section IV.A.1 of this appendix, or on a schedule approved by 
the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 



2. Pressure-Temperature Limits and Minimum Temperature Requirements 



a. Pressure-temperature limits and minimum temperature requirements for 
the reactor vessel are given in Table 1, and are defined by the operating 
condition (i.e., hydrostatic pressure and leak tests, or normal operation 
including anticipated operational occurrences), the vessel pressure, whether 
or not fuel is in the vessel, and whether or not the core is critical. In 
Table 1, the vessel pressure is defined as a percentage of the preservice 
system hydrostatic test pressure. The appropriate requirements on both the 
pressure-temperature limits and the minimum permissible temperature must be 
met for all conditions. 

b. The pressure-temperature limits identified as ``ASME Appendix G 
limits'' in Table 1 require that the limits must be at least as conservative as limits obtained by following the methods
of analysis and the margins of safety of Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code. 

c. The minimum temperature requirements given in Table 1 pertain to the 
controlling material, which is either the material in the closure flange or 
the material in the beltline region with the highest reference temperature. 
As specified in Table 1, the minimum temperature requirements and the 
controlling material depend on the operating condition (i.e., hydrostatic 
pressure and leak tests, or normal operation including anticipated operational 
occurrences), the vessel pressure, whether fuel is in the vessel, and whether 
the core is critical. The metal temperature of the controlling material, in 
the region of the controlling material which has the least favorable 
combination of stress and temperature, must exceed the appropriate minimum 
temperature requirement for the condition and pressure of the vessel specified 
in Table 1. 

d. Pressure tests and leak tests of the reactor vessel that are 
required by Section XI of the ASME Code must be completed before the core is 
critical. 

B. If the procedures of Section IV.A. of this appendix do not indicate 
the existence of an equivalent safety margin, the reactor vessel beltline may 
be given a thermal annealing treatment to recover the fracture toughness of 
the material, subject to the requirements of  50.66. The reactor vessel may 
continue to be operated only for that service period within which the 
predicted fracture toughness of the beltline region materials satisfies the 
requirements of Section IV.A. of this appendix using the values of RTNDT and 
Charpy upper-shelf energy that include the effects of annealing and subsequent 
irradiation.

Appendix H to Part 50_Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program Requirements 



Table of Contents 



I. Introduction 

II. Definitions 

III. Surveillance Program Criteria 

IV. Report of Test Results 



I. Introduction 



The purpose of the material surveillance program required by this appendix is to monitor changes in the fracture toughness
properties of ferritic materials in the reactor vessel beltline region of light water nuclear power reactors which
result from exposure of these materials to neutron irradiation and the thermal environment. Under the program, fracture
toughness test data are obtained from material specimens exposed in surveillance capsules, which are withdrawn
periodically from the reactor vessel. These data will be used as described in Section IV of Appendix G to this part.


ASTM E 185-73, -79, and -82, ``Standard Practice for Conducting Surveillance Tests for Light-Water
Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor Vessels,'' which are referenced in the following paragraphs, have been approved for
incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register. Copies of ASTM E 185-73, -79, and -82,
may be purchased from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103 and are
available for inspection at the NRC Library, 11545 Rockville Pike, Two White Flint North, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738.




II. Definitions 



All terms used in this Appendix have the same meaning as in Appendix G. 



III. Surveillance Program Criteria 



A. No material surveillance program is required for reactor vessels for which it can be conservatively demonstrated
by analytical methods applied to experimental data and tests performed on comparable vessels, making appropriate
allowances for all uncertainties in the measurements, that the peak neutron fluence at the end of the design life of
the vessel will not exceed 1017 n/cm2 (E 

>

1 MeV). 

B. Reactor vessels that do not meet the conditions of paragraph II.A of this appendix must have their beltline materials
monitored by a surveillance program complying with ASTM E 185, as modified by this appendix. 

1. The design of the surveillance program and the withdrawal schedule must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185-73
or the edition of ASTM E 185 that is current on the issue date of the ASME Code to which the reactor vessel was purchased,
whichever is later. Later editions of ASTM E 185 may be used, but including only those editions through 1982. For each
capsule withdrawal, the test procedures and reporting requirements must meet the requirements of ASTM E 185-82
to the extent practicable for the configuration of the specimens in the capsule. 

2. Surveillance specimen capsules must be located near the inside vessel wall in the beltline region so that the specimen
irradiation history duplicates, to the extent practicable within the physical constraints of the system, the neutron
spectrum, temperature history, and maximum neutron fluence experienced by the reactor vessel inner surface. If
the capsule holders are attached to the vessel wall or to the vessel cladding, construction and inservice inspection
of the attachments and attachment welds must be done according to the requirements for permanent structural attachments
to reactor vessels given in Sections III and XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure
Vessel Code (ASME Code). The design and location of the capsule holders must permit insertion of replacement capsules.
Accelerated irradiation capsules may be used in addition to the required number of surveillance capsules. 

3. A proposed withdrawal schedule must be submitted with a technical justification as specified in  50.4. The
proposed schedule must be approved prior to implementation. 

C. Requirements for an Integrated Surveillance Program 

1. In an integrated surveillance program, the representative materials chosen for surveillance for a reactor are
irradiated in one or more other reactors that have similar design and operating features. Integrated surveillance
programs must be approved by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, on a case-by-case basis. Criteria
for approval include the following: 

a. The reactor in which the materials will be irradiated and the reactor for which the materials are being irradiated
must have sufficiently similar design and operating features to permit accurate comparisons of the predicted amount
of radiation damage. 

b. Each reactor must have an adequate dosimetry program. 

c. There must be adequate arrangement for data sharing between plants. 

d. There must be a contingency plan to assure that the surveillance program for each reactor will not be jeopardized
by operation at reduced power level or by an extended outage of another reactor from which data are expected. 

e. There must be substantial advantages to be gained, such as reduced power outages or reduced personnel exposure
to radiation, as a direct result of not requiring surveillance capsules in all reactors in the set. 

2. No reduction in the requirements for number of materials to be irradiated, specimen types, or number of specimens
per reactor is permitted. 

3. After (the effective date of this section), no reduction in the amount of testing is permitted unless previously
authorized by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. 



IV. Report of Test Results 



A. Each capsule withdrawal and the test results must be the subject of a summary technical report to be submitted, as
specified in  50.4, within one year of the date of capsule withdrawal, unless an extension is granted by the Director,
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering
a change to the regulation governing the operation of the State Route 27 swing span drawbridge across Kelso Bayou,
mile 0.7 at Hackberry, Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that from about May 25 (the
beginning of the shrimping season as set by the state yearly), until October 31, the bridge open on signal from 7 a.m.
to 7 p.m. and open on 4-hours notice from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Then from November 1, through December 22, the draw would open
on signal from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 7 a.m. open on 4-hours notice. From December 22, until about May 25, the
draw would open on 24-hours notice. Presently, the bridge opens on signal from about May 25, until December 22. From
December 22, until about May 25 the draw opens on 4-hours notice. Alternate routes are available.


This action would provide relief to the bridge owner and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Request for Comments


Interested parties are invited to participate in the proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge and give
reasons for concurrence with or any recommended change in this proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgment that their
comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Eighth Coast Guard District
at the address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

The Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of
final action on this proposal. The proposed regulation may be changed in the light of comments received. 



Drafting Information 



The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney. 



Background and Purpose 



LDOTD has requested the new proposed regulation because of a decline in vessel traffic that passes the Kelso Bayou
bridge at Hackberry, during certain times of the year. The new proposed regulation would allow the bridge owner relief
from having a person available at the bridge site during the periods that vessel traffic is less frequent. This proposed
new regulation would create a savings to the taxpayer while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interest.




Discussion of Proposed Rules 



The Kelso Bayou bridge is a 406 foot structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge are 9.1 feet vertical
above mean high water in the closed position and unlimited in the open position. Horizontal clearance is 50.0 feet.
Navigation on the waterway consists of mainly small and large fishing boats, with occasional small oil field work
boats. Data provided by LDOTD show that from January 1, through December 31, the number of vessels that passed the bridge
totaled 740 for the year. This breaks down to about 61.6 vessels per month or 2.0 vessels per 24-hour period. Alternate
routes are available. They are the Calcasieu Ship Channel, the Intracoastal Canal and the salt ditch. 



Regulatory Evaluation 



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). 

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 



Small Entities 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small business and not-for-profit organizations that
are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with
populations of less than 50,000. 

Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels; the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney.


Background and Purpose


LDOTD has requested the 4-hour difference in the time the bridgeowner is required to have an attendant on duty, because
of a decline in vessel traffic that passes the Mermentau River bridge at Grand Chenier. The four-hour difference would
allow the bridge owner relief from having a person available at the bridge site, thereby, creating a savings to the
taxpayer while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interest.


Discussion of Proposed Rules


The Mermentau River bridge is a 1049 foot structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge are 16-feet vertical
above mean high water in the closed position and unlimited in the open position. Horizontal clearance is 69.5 feet.
The depth of the waterway at the bridge site is approximately 20 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of mainly
small and large fishing boats, tugs with tows and work boats. Data provided by LDOTD show that from January 1, through
December 31, 1993, the number of vessels that passed the bridge totaled 2929 for the year. This breaks down to about
240 vessels per month or 8.0 vessels per 24-hour period. Alternate routes are available. They are the Calcasieu Ship
Channel and the Intracoastal Canal.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Columbia River, OR and WA 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is proposing an amendment to the drawbridge regulations governing the operation of the twin Interstate
5 drawbridges across the Columbia River, mile 106.5, between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. The original
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed an extension of the morning and afternoon time periods when the draw need not
open for the passage of vessels without regard to vessel type or river flow condition. This supplemental notice of
proposed rulemaking proposes an amendment which would provide for relatively uninterrupted vehicular flow during
peak traffic times while being less restrictive to commercial navigation during periods of high river flow conditions.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments 



Interested persons are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments,
data, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge,
and give reasons for concurrence with, or any recommended changes in, the proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgment
that their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. 

The Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course
of final action on this proposal. The proposed regulations may be changed in light of comments received. 



Drafting Information 



The principle persons involved in drafting this notice are John E. Mikesell, project manager, and Lieutenant Laticia
J. Argenti, project attorney. 



Background and Purpose 



The twin Interstate 5 vertical lift bridges across the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver are required
to open on signal, except that from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday except Federal holidays
the draws need not open. These closed periods are necessary to accommodate peak morning and afternoon vehicular commute
traffic across the bridges. Both bridges also provide alternate mid-level fixed spans which provide greater vertical
clearance than do the drawspans in the closed position. The alternate fixed spans are routinely used by tug and barge
traffic except at higher water surface elevations. Because the number of vehicles crossing the interstate bridges
has increased dramatically, particularly during commute times, any opening in close proximity, before or after,
results in unacceptable vehicular traffic delays. Therefore, Oregon State Department of Transportation (ORDOT)
has requested an extension of the weekday closed periods. On November 26, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice
of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 62302). In addition, the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District also published the proposal in a Public
Notice dated December 14, 1993. Both notices advised the public that the Coast Guard was considering a proposal to
extend the morning and afternoon time periods during which the draw need not open for the passage of vessels. The morning
period would be changed to 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and the afternoon period would be changed to 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. The Coast
Guard received five comments in response to its public notice and no comments to its Federal Register notice. One commenter,
a federal resource agency which routinely responds to our public notices did not take a position in favor or against
the proposed amendment. Two commenters representing land transportation interests favored the proposal. Two commenters
representing commercial navigation interests stated opposition to the proposal unless it was modified to provide
the following: (1) When the vertical clearance under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is less
than 52 feet (river gauge 6.0 feet or more), the closed periods remain as existing. (2) When the vertical clearance
under the green center of channel lights of the wide fixed span is greater than 52 feet (river gauge 5.9 feet or less),
the proposed closed periods would be in effect. 

 




Note:

 The referenced wide fixed span is the span between the vertical lift span and the designated alternate channel fixed
span. Following further investigation by the Coast Guard it was determined that because vertical clearances of less
than 52 feet under the center of the wide fixed span occur only during spring run off or other infrequent flood conditions,
the requested change was reasonable for commercial navigation. We have incorporated it in this supplemental notice
of proposed rulemaking. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held.

Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. it has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this action to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and
procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Because most waterway traffic can be accommodated by the alternate fixed span channel
and the rule would revert to its previous less restrictive form when the vertical clearance under the alternate fixed
span was less than 52 feet, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this propsal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory
Evaluation is innecessary. 


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et al.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). Because the impacts of this proposal are expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under section
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this proposal will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Collection of Information


This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.).


Federalism


This proposal has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


Environment


This proposal has been reviewed by the Coast Guard and has been determined to be categorically excluded from further
environmental documentation under the authority of 40 CFR Section 1507.3 and in accordance with paragraph 2.B.2.g.(5)
of the NEPA Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B. A copy of the Categorical Exclusion Certification is

 Notice of termination. 

 

 

 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This rulemaking project was initiated to modify existing traffic separation schemes (TSSs) and establish a shipping
safety fairway (SSF) off the coast of California to preserve a right of way for navigation through areas which were
expected to be sites of offshore oil and gas development. The proposal was based on port access route studies conducted
in the early 1980's. Congress later placed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off California, and in September, 1992,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dedicated the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary
(MBNMS). The MBNMS encompasses the area where the Coast Guard had proposed the SSF to prohibit structures. The SSF
is no longer needed because oil and gas drilling are prohibited in the Sanctuary. Additionally, the data that supported
the proposed changes is now outdated. Therefore, the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket
number 83-032.

 

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The 1978 amendments to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), required the Coast Guard to undertake
a port access route study to determine the need for traffic separation schemes or shipping safety fairways to increase
vessel traffic safety in offshore areas subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. The Coast Guard initiated this study
by publishing a Notice of Proposed Study on April 16, 1979 (44 FR 22543). 

 

For the purposes of the port access route study, the U.S. coastline was divided into 32 geographically defined areas.
Study area 22 included the coast of southern California and study areas 23 to 25 included the central and northern California
coast. Through public participation and government agency consultation, the studies evaluated potential traffic
density patterns, waterways use of conflicts, and the need for safe access routes in offshore areas. 

 The Study Results for the coast of southern California (area 22) were published on June 24, 1982 (47 FR 27430). An additional
study of the Port Access Routes, Northern Approach to Santa Barbara Channel, was announced on July 26, 1984 (49 FR 30078),
and results published on December 5, 1985 (50 FR 49861). 

 The Study Results for the central and northern coast of California (areas 23-25) were published on October 14,
1982 (47 FR 46043). An additional study on Port Access Routes, Entrance to San Francisco Bay was announced on December
17, 1984 (49 FR 48946), and the study results were published on May 8, 1986 (51 FR 17071). 

 The port access route studies recommended amendments to the TSSs off the coast of California and the designation of
new SSFs to establish a comprehensive safe routing system for vessels proceeding to, from, or between the ports of
San Francisco and Los Angeles-Long Beach. The Coast Guard published a proposed rule on April 27, 1989 (54 FR 18258)
to implement the study recommendations. However, after considering information from public hearings, extensive
written comments opposing the proposal, the Congressional moratorium on oil and gas drilling, and the effect of the
MBNMS, the Coast Guard has determined that the proposed SSF is not needed. Therefore, this rulemaking is no longer
necessary, and the Coast Guard is terminating further rulemaking under docket number 83-032. On August 24,
1993 (58 FR 44634), the Coast Guard announced a new study of the area to evaluate the need for routing measures in the
approaches to California ports and the need for measures to regulate vessel traffic in the offshore California national
marine sanctuaries to protect sanctuary resources.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Arizona State Implementation Plan Revision, Maricopa County
Division of Air Pollution Control



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP) which control emissions from
solvent degreasing operations, petroleum solvent dry cleaning, gasoline transfer, and the use of roadway asphalt.
The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in accordance
with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. 



EPA proposed conditional approval of earlier submittals of several of these rules in the 

Federal Register

 on September 29, 1992 based on the Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control's (the Division's) commitment
to fix the rule deficiencies. The Division has fulfilled its commitment to fix the rules, and has submitted the revised
rules being acted upon in this document. EPA has evaluated each of the rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions
of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards,
and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Applicability 



The rules being proposed for approval into the Arizona SIP include: Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control
(the Division) Rules 331, Solvent Cleaning; 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning; 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt;
and 353, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks. These rules were submitted to EPA by the Arizona Department
of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) on August 10 (Rules 331 and 333), November 13 (Rule 340), and June 29 (Rule 353), 1992.




Background 



On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included Maricopa County. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.303. On March 19, 1979, EPA
changed the name and modified the geographic boundaries of the ozone nonattainment area of Maricopa County to the
Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) Urban Planning Area. 44 FR 16391, 40 CFR 81.303. On February 24, 1984, EPA
notified the Governor of Arizona, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the Division's portion
of the Arizona SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the
existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call, 49 FR 18827, May 3, 1984). On May 26, 1988, EPA again notified the Governor
of Arizona that the Division's portion of the Arizona SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies relating to VOC controls and the application of reasonably available control technology
(RACT) in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's second SIP-Call, 53 FR 34500, September 7, 1988). On November 15, 1990,
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.
In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient RACT rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections
of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of
the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct
RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amended guidance.
 EPA's SIP-Calls used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The
MAG Urban Planning Area is classified as moderate
; therefore, this area is subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

On June 22, 1991, EPA notified the State of Arizona that EPA had not received by the May 15, 1991 deadline all required
VOC rule corrections under section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. The finding letter identified that the Division had failed
to submit required rule corrections. The official finding notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554). The Division's Rule 353 was listed in that finding notice. As a result, the Division
had 18 months to submit those rules to EPA before a sanction would be imposed. 

On September 29, 1992, in 57 FR 44718, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed conditional
approval of the following Division rules into the Arizona SIP: Dry Cleaning, and (3) Rule 340, Cutback and Emulsified
Asphalt.
 The conditional approval proposed for the rules was based on the State's commitment to correct deficiencies identified
in the rules by EPA. The corrected rules were submitted before EPA finalized the conditional approval and were submitted
to fulfill the State's commitment to correct the deficiencies. 





The State of Arizona submitted several revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on June 29, August 10, and
November 13, 1992 including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action
for the Division's Rule 331, Solvent Cleaning; Rule 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning (both adopted by the Division
on June 22, 1992); Rule 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt (adopted September 21, 1992); and Rule 353, Transfer of
Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks (adopted April 6, 1992). These submitted rules were found to be complete
on September 3, 1992 (Rule 353), September 16, 1992, (Rule 340), and December 2, 1992 (Rules 331 and 333) pursuant to
EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V
 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. The finding of completeness stopped the sanctions clock that had
been started for Rule 353 on October 22, 1991. 





Rules 331, 333, 340, and 353 are rules that control VOC emissions from the cleaning (degreasing) of parts, from dry
cleaning operations using petroleum solvents, from asphalt used for roadways, and from the filling of tanks with
gasoline. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The original rules which were the subject
of the proposed conditional approval were submitted in response to EPA's SIP-Calls and the CAA requirement that nonattainment
areas to fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA
guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. The current rules were submitted in fulfillment
of the Division's commitment to fix remaining deficiencies identified in EPA's proposed conditional approval or
in response the EPA's finding of nonsubmittal. The rules were adopted as part of the Division's efforts to achieve
the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. 



EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 



In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.

For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTGs that apply to the four RACT rules follow: 








Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance
documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. 

The Division's submitted rules include the following significant changes from the current SIP: 


Rule 331, Solvent Cleaning 


1. The cooling capacity of freeboard chillers has been specified. 
2. A provision for a vapor level control safety switch on vapor degreasers has been added. 
3. Regulations for small conveyorized degreasers have been added. 
4. Provisions for Control Officer approval of alternate control devices have been deleted. 
5. Test methods for determining compliance and recordkeeping provisions have been added. 
6. Exemption of wipe cleaners and a proposed schedule for compliance have been deleted. 
7. A definition of ``low volatility solvent'' and standards applying to low and high volatility solvents have been
added. 
8. In response to EPA's comments during the rule revision period, (1) the term ``leaks'' has been defined, (2) a provision
for covers for remote reservoir cleaners has been added, and (3) daily recordkeeping (except for wipe cleaning) has
been added. 


Rule 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning 


1. Operating requirements for dryers, filters and recovery units have been added. 
2. A solvent use cutoff has been deleted.

3. Test methods and recordkeeping provisions used for determining compliance have been added. 
4. A provision for the immediate placement of filtration material in sealed containers has been added. 


Rule 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt 


1. A provision for a seasonal exemption has been deleted. 
2. A provision allowing the Control Officer discretion for test methods has been deleted and the test methods provision
clarified. 
3. More stringent provisions for VOC content of asphalt have been added. 
4. A number of exemptions have been deleted. 
5. Recordkeeping provisions have been added. 


Rule 353, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks 


1. A definitions section has been added. 
2. The standards section has been expanded to include use of approved Stage I vapor recovery equipment and leak-free
equipment. 
3. The maintenance section has been expanded to include owner responsibility to use equipment correctly, and to require
owners to refuse offloading by delivery trucks not bearing a pressure test certification decal. 
4. The exemption of non-resale operations is limited by a lower throughput cutoff of 120,000 gallons annually. The
exemption for tanks serviced by exempt delivery vessels is now limited by a throughput cutoff of 120,000 gallons annually.
Lastly, the exemption of certain storage tanks from the rule by the Control Officer has been deleted. 
5. A compliance schedule requiring compliance within one year of the date of rule adoption has been added. 
6. The monitoring and records section has been expanded to include throughput recordkeeping and test methods to use
to determine compliance. 

EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, the Division's Rule 331, Solvent Cleaning; Rule 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning; Rule
340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt; and Rule 353, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks, are being
proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D.



Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 


Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a 
regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action.
The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing to approve a revision to Texas' SIP for ozone. This action is based upon a revision request which
was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended November 15, 1990, and the Photochemical
Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) regulations. The PAMS regulation requires the State to provide for the establishment
and maintenance of an enhanced ambient air quality monitoring network in the form of PAMS by November 12, 1993. 

In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will
be withdrawn, and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this
action should do so at this time.

Alternate Inspection Compliance Programs for the U.S. Maritime Industry



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of meeting; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As part of its Maritime Regulatory Reform Initiative, the U.S. Coast Guard is developing programs to provide alternatives
by which the U.S. maritime industry can demonstrate compliance with applicable vessel design, construction, equipment
and operational requirements. A number of concepts are under consideration, including a program to accept tests
and examinations performed by vessel owners or operators who employ a rigorous system of safety management. The Coast
Guard desires input from the maritime industry on the safety management systems now in use and their value in assuring
vessel safety. The Coast Guard will conduct a public meeting to obtain information from members of the regulated community
and the general public on this issue.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard has been actively engaged in maritime policy reforms designed to enhance the competitiveness of the
U.S. maritime industry. One aspect of maritime policy reform is to provide efficient and cost effective alternatives
by which owners and operators of inspected vessels can demonstrate compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
One concept under consideration is to credit tests and examinations of a vessel's systems, components or equipment
performed by the vessel's owners, operators or authorized third parties as satisfying Coast Guard inspection requirements.
This concept can provide vessel owners and operators with greater flexibility in complying with Coast Guard inspection
requirements and may significantly reduce the time necessary to complete, or may eliminate, certain periodic Coast
Guard inspections.



Under such a program, vessel owners, operators or authorized third parties would conduct periodic tests and examinations
in accordance with written procedures acceptable to the Coast Guard. These procedures would indicate the purpose
and methodology of the test, as well as the qualifications of the personnel who perform and validate the test. They
would also indicate how the test is to be documented. Periodic Coast Guard inspections would involve verifying the
company's inspection records for the vessel and assessing the crew's ability to respond to likely shipboard emergencies.

This concept is predicated on the vessel owner or operator employing a rigorous system of safety management. The Coast
Guard is seeking to establish the characteristics for a safety management system which should be recognized under
this program. There are many ways to support the quality of safety management systems, such as the ISO 9000 series,
the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (International Safety
Management [ISM] Code), the International Ship Managers Association Code of Ship Management Standards, or company
specific in-house safety management systems, all of which if properly implemented and maintained, may provide a
basis for Coast Guard acceptance of owner, operator or third party testing.


To aid the Coast Guard's efforts to establish the criteria for a recognized safety management system, and establish
guidelines for alternative compliance inspection programs, views are solicited on the following questions:

1. What are the essential elements of a shipboard safety management system?

Cable Television Service; List of Major Television Markets



<AGENCY>

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission, through this action, invites comments on its proposal to amend its rules regarding the listing of
major television markets, to change the designation of the Fresno-Visalia-Hanford-Clovis, California television
market to include the community of Sanger, California. This action is taken at the request of Sanger Telecasters,
Inc., licensee of television station KMSG-TV, channel 59, Sanger, California and it is taken to test the proposal
for market hyphenation through the record established based on comments filed by interested parties.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,

 CS Docket 94-99, adopted September 2, 1994 and released September 19, 1994. The full text of this decision is
available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street,
NW, Washington, D.C. 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, (202) 857-3800, 1919 M Street, NW, Washington D.C. 20554.





Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. The Commission, in response to a Petition for Rule Making filed by the petitioner, proposed to amend Section 76.51
of the Rules to add the community of Sanger to the Fresno-Visalia-Hanford-Clovis, California television market.

2. In evaluating past requests for hyphenation of a market, the Commission has considered the following factors as
relevant to its examination: (1) The distance between the existing designated communities and the community proposed
to be added to the designation; (2) whether cable carriage, if afforded to the subject station, would extend to areas
beyond its Grade B signal coverage area; (3) the presence of a clear showing of a particularized need by the station
requesting the change of market designation; and (4) an indication of benefit to the public from the proposed change.
Each of these factors helps the Commission to evaluate individual market conditions consistent ``with the underlying
competitive purpose of the market hyphenation rule to delineate areas where stations can and do, both actually and
logically, compete.''

3. Based on the facts presented, the Commission believes that a sufficient case for redesignation of the subject market
has been set forth so that this proposal should be tested through the rule making process, including the comments of
interested parties. It appears from the information before the Commission that the television stations licensed
to Fresno, Visalia, Hanford, Clovis, and Sanger, California do compete throughout much of the proposed combined
market area, and that sufficient evidence has been presented tending to demonstrate commonality between the proposed
communities to be added to the market designation and the market as a whole that ``hyphenation'' of the market should
be proposed. Moreover, the petitioners' proposal appears to be consistent with the Commission's policies regarding
redesignation of a hyphenated television market. Accordingly, comment is requested on the proposed addition of
Sanger to the Fresno-Visalia-Hanford-Clovis, California television market.

4. The Commission certifies that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rulemaking proceeding
because if the proposed rule amendment is promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A few cable television
system operators will be affected by the proposed rule amendment. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of
Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Production Surveillance 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with request for public comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council is proposing changes to the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) to revise
the criteria for determining when to perform on-site technical production surveillance.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


The proposed rule revised DFARS 242.1104 by replacing the current system of determining the type of production surveillance
to be performed. Under current procedures, contracts are placed into categories 1, 2, and 3 which determine the level
of surveillance the contract will receive. The proposed revisions would simplify the method of determining when
the contract would receive pre-delivery telephone surveillance or pre-delivery on-site production surveillance.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

., because the frequency of on-site surveillance is not expected to change. The proposed rule merely simplifies the
method used by the Government to determine when on-site surveillance will be performed. An initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IRFA) has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested
parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS Subparts will be considered in accordance with
Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite DAR Case 93-D003 in all correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because the proposed rule imposes no reporting and
recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Therefore it is proposed that 48 CFR Part 242 be amended as follows:
1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Part 242 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR Part 1. 


PART 242_CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION


2. Section 242.1104 is revised to read as follows: 


 242.1104 

Surveillance requirements.


(a)(i) As a minimum, contracts will receive pre-delivery telephonic, surveillance.
(ii) Contracts in the following categories will receive pre-delivery on-site production surveillance. 
(A) Contracts assigned criticality designator A (see FAR 42.1105).
(B) Contracts specifically identified for special surveillance by the contracting officer. 
(C) Any contract where telephonic surveillance reveals actual or anticipated delinquency unless the contract administration
office, in coordination with the contracting officer, decides that on-site surveillance is not warranted.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered or 
Threatened Status for 10 Plants From the Foothills of the Sierra 
Nevada Mountains in California 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes 
endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (Act) for four plants: 

Brodiaea pallida

 (Chinese Camp 
brodiaea), 

Calyptridium pulchellum

 (Mariposa pussypaws), 

Lupinus 
citrinus

 var. 

deflexus

 (Mariposa lupine), and 

Mimulus shevockii

 
(Kelso Creek monkeyflower). The Service also proposes threatened 
status for six plants: 

Allium tuolumnense

 (Rawhide Hill onion), 


Clarkia springvillensis

 (Springville clarkia), 

Carpenteria 
californica

 (carpenteria), 

Fritillaria striata

 (Greenhorn adobe 
lily), 

Navarretia setiloba

 (Piute Mountains navarretia), and 

Verbena 
californica

 (Red Hills vervain). These plants are known from the 
annual grassland, chaparral, Joshua tree, pinyon-juniper, blue oak, 
and digger pine woodland communities in the foothills of the Sierra 
Nevada Mountains in central California. The 10 plants are threatened 
by one or more of the following: agricultural land conversion, 
urbanization, logging, highway construction and road maintenance 
activities, overgrazing, off-highway vehicle use, mining, insect 
predation, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, stochastic extinction 
from random natural events, and incompatible fire management 
techniques. This proposal, if made final, would implement the 
Federal protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act for 
these plants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 




Allium tuolumnense

 (Rawhide Hill onion), 

Brodiaea pallida

 
(Chinese Camp brodiaea), 

Calyptridium pulchellum

 (Mariposa 
pussypaws), 

Carpenteria californica

 (Mariposa lupine), 


Mimulus shevockii

 (Kelso Creek monkeyflower), 

Navarretia setiloba

 
(Piute Mountains navarretia), and 

Verbena californica

 (Red Hills 
vervain) are located in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada 
Mountains in California, from Jamestown in Tuolumne County, to 
Bodfish in Kern County, to near Grapevine in the foothills of the 
Tehachapi Mountains in Kern County. The Sierra Nevada Mountains are 
California's largest mountain range, extending from the Mojave Desert 
in the south to the Modoc Plateau in the north. The Sierra Nevada 
Mountains are 645 kilometers (km) (400 miles) long, 95 to 130 km (60 
to 80 miles) wide, and north-south oriented on the east side of 
California. Structurally, this mountain range is a westerly tilted 
Cenozoic fault block consisting of granitic and metamorphic rocks. 
These mountains have an elevational range of 1,000 to 4,000 meters 
(m) (3,000 to 12,000 feet (ft)) and a precipitation range of 750 to 
2,030 millimeters (mm) (30 to 80 inches (in)). These mountains are a 
region of winter snow and some summer thunderstorms. Montane and 
subalpine coniferous forests dominate the area with minor components 
of deciduous forests. Lakes, swamps, rock outcrops, talus slopes, 
meadows, and montane chaparral occupy more than half of the ground 
surface.

Each of these 10 plant species exhibits strong substrate preferences. 

Allium tuolumnense, Brodiaea pallida, 

and 

Verbena californica 

are associated with serpentine soils in an elevational range from 260 to 600 m (850 to 2,000 ft) in the Red Hills and near
Rawhide Hill in Tuolumne County. Serpentine soils are derived from ultramafic rocks such as serpentinite, dunite,
and peridotite, which are found in discontinuous outcrops in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and in the Coast Ranges
from Santa Barbara County to British Columbia, Canada. Although the ultramafic rocks may be of igneous origin (peridotite,
dunite, or harzburgite) or metamorphics (serpentine), the major constituent of the parent rock is some variant of
iron-magnesium silicate. Serpentine and other ultramafics weather into shallow, rocky, and highly erodible soils.
Typically, these soils are rich in magnesium, iron, chromium, nickel, and silicates and are deficient in nitrogen,
calcium, phosphorus, and molybdenum (Kruckeberg 1984). The unique mineral nutrition and cation status of serpentine
soils are inhospitable for the growth of most plants. Nevertheless, serpentine soils support a diversity of plants,
some of which are restricted entirely to these soils. 

Allium tuolumnense 

is associated with sunny, rocky, often south-facing slopes. 

Brodiaea pallida 

and 

Verbena californica 

are often found in the blue oak (

Quercus douglasii

) or digger pine (

Pinus sabiniana

) woodland communities. 




Calyptridium pulchellum, Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus, 

and 

Mimulus shevockii 

are associated with sandy, decomposed granitic soils in foothill woodlands. 

Fritillaria striata 

and 

Navarretia setiloba 

are found in heavy clay soils in the openings of blue oak woodland. 

Clarkia springvillensis 

most often is found on roadbanks and openings in blue oak woodlands. 


Marion Ownbey first recognized 

Allium sanbornii 

var. 

tuolumnense

 in ``A California Flora'' (Munz 1959). The first validly published description of the plant was Hamilton P. Traub's
1972 treatment. Stella Denison and Dale McNeal (1989) revised the 

A. sanbornii 

complex and elevated the variety to a species based upon the position of stamens and styles and the length and shape
of perianth (sepals and petals) segments.

Allium tuolumnense 

is an erect, herbaceous perennial of the lily family (Liliaceae) that grows from underground bulbs. This species
has fleshy, green entire leaves that reach a height of 25 to 50 centimeters (cm) (10 to 20 in), and has a loose, 20 to 60
flowered, white- or pink-flushed inflorescence appearing in late March to early May. 

Allium tuolumnense 

differs from 

A. sanbornii 

and 

A. jepsonii 

in its entire, spreading perianth segments, fringed ovarian bumps (processes), and early blooming period that does
not overlap with any other 

Allium 

species. Although this plant can reproduce from seed, 

A. tuolumnense 

tends to reproduce asexually from its underground bulb, forming small colonies of usually fewer than 100 plants per
colony (BioSystems Analysis 1984). 

A. tuolumnense 

is a highly restricted endemic that only grows on serpentine soils in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in southwestern
Tuolumne County from 400 to 600 m (1,310 to 1,970 ft) in elevation. 

A. tuolumnense

 is known from two localities: Table Mountain and the Red Hills. The entire range of the species includes a 342 square
kilometer (sq km) (132 square mile (sq mi)) area. Approximately 25 percent of 

A. tuolumnense 

is found on private lands and 75 percent on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). 

A. tuolumnense 

is threatened by placer mining, urbanization, and potentially by overgrazing. 

Robert Hoover (1938) first described 

Brodiaea pallida 

from specimens collected near Chinese Camp in Tuolumne County. 

B. pallida 

is an erect, herbaceous perennial in the lily family (Liliaceae). The plant grows from an underground bulb and has
long, narrow, thick, succulent leaves that reach a height of 1 to 3 decimeters (dm) (4 to 12 in). Several to many rose-pink
flowers appear in an umbrella-like cluster at the top of a leafless stem in late May to early June. 

B. pallida 

grows in association with two sympatric congeners and can hybridize with one of them (Keator 1993). Despite these
incidences of hybridization, the species is considered stable (Blaine Rogers, Columbia Coll., pers. comm., 1993).


B. pallida 

can be separated from its congeners and hybrids by flower color and the length, width, shape, and position of nonpollen
bearing stamens. 



Brodiaea pallida 

grows in seeps and springs in serpentine and volcanic soils within a stream channel on private land in the Red Hills,
Tuolumne County. This species is restricted to a 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) wide and 0.8 km (0.5 mi) long stretch of private land
in an old, intermittent stream channel at an elevation of 385 m (1,260 ft). The species has always had an extremely limited
distribution; searches of potential habitat in other areas have failed to locate any additional plants. The single
population is threatened by urbanization, inadequate State regulatory mechanisms, and stochastic events. Several
of the parcels of privately-owned land where the plant is located are for sale. Although The Nature Conservancy (TNC)
has secured a 1-year lease on one of the parcels, permanent protection for this plant is lacking. 

Joseph Congdon collected the type specimen of 

Calyptridium pulchellum 

on ``Pea Ridge'' in Mariposa County in 1901. Alice Eastwood (1902) first described this plant as 

Spraguea pulchella. 

Robert Hoover (1940) revised the genera 

Spraguea 

and 

Calyptridium 

and renamed this plant 

Calyptridium pulchellum 

based on the combination of flower and vegetative characteristics and habitat. 

C. pulchellum 

is a small, compact, rosette-forming, annual herb in the purslane family (Portulacaceae). The smooth, slender,
prostrate stems are 1 to 2 dm (4 to 8 in) long, with smooth, spatula-shaped leaves. Rose-colored, four-petaled flowers
appear in loose panicles between May and August.

The fibrous-rooted plant grows on decomposed granitic sands 
between elevations of 460 to 1,090 m (1,500 to 3,600 ft) in foothill 
woodlands and converted chaparral grasslands in the Sierra Nevada 
foothills. No other species of 

Calyptridium 

co-occurs with 

C. 
pulchellum.

 The seven populations of 

C

. 

pulchellum 

are found in 
Fresno, Madera, and Mariposa Counties over a range of 1,940 sq km 
(750 sq mi). Six populations of 

C

. 

pulchellum 

occur on private land 
and one population occurs on Forest Service land (Sierra National 
Forest). 

C

. 

pulchellum 

is threatened by urbanization and potentially 
by overgrazing. 

John C. Fremont collected 

Carpenteria californica 

from an area 
in the Kings River watershed on his third expedition to California in 
1846. John Torrey (1852) first described 

C

. 

californica 

from 
specimens sent to him by John Fremont. The monotypic genus 


Carpenteria 

is one of California's many endemic genera that are 
relicts without any close relatives; this genus probably had a wider 
range earlier in Tertiary time (Barbour and Major 1988). 



Carpenteria californica 

is an erect to spreading evergreen 
shrub in the mock orange family (Philadelphaceae) that grows to a 
height of 1 to 6.5 m (3 to 13 ft). The plant has glossy green, 
opposite leaves and pale bark that peels in large sheets in the fall. 
Terminal, white, showy flowers appear in May or June and last through 
July at the upper elevational limits. 

C

. 

californica 

is found in 
drainages and mesic areas on mostly granitic soils from 460 to 1,220 
m (1,500 to 4,000 ft) in elevation within the chaparral and 
cismontane woodland communities of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada 
in eastern Fresno County. 

C

. 

californica 

is known from six 
populations distributed over a 583 sq km (225 sq mi) area. One 
population of 

C

. 

californica 

is on private lands, four are on lands 
administered by the U.S. Forest Service (Sierra National Forest), and 
one is on both private and Forest Service lands. Collectively, 
approximately 30 percent of 

C. californica 

 individuals occur on 
private lands. A portion of one population of 

C. californica

 is 
protected on a preserve owned by TNC. 

C

. 

californica 

is threatened 
by urbanization, fire management practices, overgrazing and trampling 
by cattle, and inadequate State regulatory mechanisms. Logging, 
illegal dumping, highway construction, maintenance of roads and 
rights-of-way activities, and competition from native brush species 
have the potential to adversely impact this species. 

Frank Vasek (1964) first collected and described 

Clarkia 
springvillensis 

from its type locality along Balch Park Road near 
Springville, Tulare County. 

C

. 

springvillensis 

is an erect annual 
herb in the evening-primrose family (Onagraceae). The 1 m (3 ft) 
tall plant has simple or usually branched stems. The bright green 
leaves are 2 to 9 cm (0.8 to 3.5 in) long and 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 
in) wide. The lavender-pink flowers appear in May to July and 
usually have a dark purplish basal spot. 

C

. 

springvillensis 

can be 
separated from the sympatric congener 

C

. 

unguiculata 

by the absence 
of long hairs on the calyx and ovary, the purple sepals, and the dark 
purplish spot at the base of the petals. 



Clarkia springvillensis 

is found on granitic soils in open 
sunny sites in blue oak woodlands and on roadbanks from 360 to 910 m 
(1,220 to 3,000 ft) in elevation. Nine of the 10 historically 
reported populations of 

C. springvillensis 

are extant, all in Tulare 
County. Eight of the nine populations are found within a 111 sq km 
(43 sq mi) area in eastern Tulare County, with the remaining 
population occurring 26 km (16 mi) to the northwest. One population 
of 

C

. 

springvillensis 

is partially protected where it occurs on 
California Department of Fish and Game land, one population is on 
lands owned by Tulare County, three are on privately owned land, and 
four populations are on lands administered by the Forest Service 
(Sequoia National Forest). Urbanization, overgrazing, timber 
operations, inadequate State regulatory mechanisms, sphinx moth 
predation, and roadway maintenance activities threaten this plant. 

Alice Eastwood (1931) described 

Fritillaria striata 

from 
specimens collected by Roy Weston on the Rattlesnake Grade in the 
Greenhorn Mountains of Kern County. 

F

. 

striata 

is a slender, 
herbaceous perennial in the lily family (Liliaceae). An unbranched 
stem grows 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) above the surface of the ground 
from an underground bulb. The predominantly basal, alternate to 
opposite leaves are oblong to lance-shaped, 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) 
wide and 6 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long. The upper leaves are narrower 
and undulate. The one to four fragrant, bell-shaped flowers appear 
from February through April. 

F

. 

striata 

differs from the related 

F

. 


pluriflora 

(adobe lily), which occurs in the northern Sacramento 
Valley foothills, in the shape, size, and coloring of the flowers, 
the conspicuous nectaries, and the connivent (converging) stigmas 
(Stebbins 1989, Eastwood 1931). 



Fritillaria striata 

is found on heavy, usually red clay soils 
on the grasslands and in the blue oak woodlands of the southeastern 
San Joaquin Valley and southern Sierra Nevada foothills. Fourteen 
populations of 

F

. 

striata 

occur in Kern County and three populations 
are found in Tulare County (California Natural Diversity Data Base 
(CNDDB) 1993) discontinuously scattered over a 7,250 sq km (2,800 sq 
mi) area. The 17 populations range in elevation from 300 to 1,430 m 
(1,000 to 4,800 ft). All populations occur on private lands. 

F

. 


striata 

is threatened by urbanization, livestock use, competition 
from nonnative grasses, agriculture land conversion, road widening, 
emergency road maintenance, inadequate State regulatory mechanisms, 
and off-highway vehicle use.

deflexus. Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus 

is an erect, diffusely-
branched annual herb belonging to the pea family (Fabaceae). The 3 
to 5 dm (12 to 20 in) high plants are short-hairy to hairless and 
have palmately compound leaves that are 15 to 25 mm (.5 to 1.0 in) 
long. The six to nine leaflets are about one-third as wide as they 
are long and are linear or spatulate in shape with rounded or obtuse 
tips. The white with pink or lavender tipped flowers appear in April 
through May. 



Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus 

grows on decomposed granitic 
sands on ridgetops and hillsides in openings in foothill woodlands 
from 475 to 580 m (1,400 to 1,900 ft) in elevation. The four 
populations of this plant occur on private lands in Mariposa County 
over a 40 sq km (15 sq mi) area. Two of the four populations co-
occur with 

Calyptridium pulchellum. Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus 


is threatened by urbanization, inadequate State regulatory 
mechanisms, and potentially by overgrazing. 

Lawrence Heckard and Rimo Bacigalupi (1986) first described 


Mimulus shevockii 

from specimen first collected by James Shevock 
around the Kelso Creek area near the east base of the Piute Mountains 
in Kern County. 

M. shevockii 

is an erect, desert annual in the 
snapdragon family (Scrophulariaceae). This plant grows to 1 dm (4 
in) in height and has opposite, sessile, somewhat fleshy leaves along 
reddish stems. Asymmetric flowers appear from late March to May. 
The corolla is two-lipped. The upper flower lip has two short, 
entire, lateral maroon-purple lobes. The lower flower lip is similar 
but larger in size and has an additional large, partially divided 
yellow lobe with red mottling. 

Mimulus androsaceus 

and 

M

. 

fremontii 


grow with 

M

. 

shevockii 

and have some similar vegetative features but 
differ in flower color. 

Mimulus androsaceus 

has a red-purple flower 
and 

M

. 

fremontii 

has a rose-purple flower. 



Mimulus shevockii 

occurs predominately in loamy, coarse sands 
on alluvial fans and deposits of granitic origin within the Joshua 
tree (

Yucca brevifolia

) or California juniper (

Juniperus californica

) 
xeric woodlands in Kern County. 

M

. 

shevockii 

is found within an 
elevational range of 975 to 1,250 m (3,200 to 4,100 ft). Six of the 
seven populations of 

M

. 

shevockii 

are within a 31 sq km (12 sq mi) 
area, with the remaining population 14 km (9 mi) to the northwest. 
Two populations are found on private lands and five populations occur 
partially on BLM land and partially on private land. 

M

. 

shevockii 

is 
threatened by urbanization, off-highway vehicle use, and agricultural 
land conversion. 

Frederick Coville (1893) first described 

Navarretia setiloba 


from plants he collected from a ridge between Kernville and Havilah 
in Kern County. 

Navarretia setiloba 

is an erect annual herb in the 
phlox family (Polemoniaceae), and grows to a height of 8 to 20 cm (3 
to 8 in). The linear, pinnately-lobed leaves have rigid, spinose 
lobes. The terminal lobe is broadly lanceolate and often purplish. 
The 20 to 30 purple-flowered inflorescence appears from April through 
June and is about 10 mm (0.4 in) long. The flowers are subtended by 
spiny bracts that are constricted in the middle. 

Navarretia setiloba 


is distinguished from sympatric cogeners by the broad terminal lobe 
on each leaf, and by its purple flowers. 

The plant grows on heavy, often red-colored clay soils within 
blue oak, digger pine, or juniper woodlands between 300 to 960 m 
(1,000 to 3,200 ft) in elevation. Six populations of 

Navarretia 
setiloba 

are known from northern Kern County over a 4,000 sq km 
(1,560 sq mi) area. One population occurs on land administered by 
the BLM and five populations are found on private lands. 

Navarretia 
setiloba 

is threatened by urbanization and off-highway vehicle use. 
Harold A. Moldenke (1942) first described 

Verbena californica 


from specimen collected by Robert Hoover from an area north of 
Keystone in Tuolumne County. 

Verbena californica 

is an erect 
perennial herb in the vervain family (Verbenaceae), and grows to 60 
cm (23 in) in height with opposite, bright green, sessile leaves. 
White-blue to purple blossoms appear from May through September. No 
closely related species co-occur with 

Verbena californica

. 

The nine historic and current populations of 

Verbena 
californica 

grow along intermittent and perennial streams underlain 
by serpentine rocks in the Red Hills of Tuolumne County. The 
populations have an elevational range from 260 to 335 m (850 to 1,150 
ft) and are distributed over a 62 sq km (24 sq mi) area. Fifteen 
percent of the 

V

. 

californica 

plants occur on lands administered by 
the BLM, and 85 percent of the plants occur on privately owned lands 
(CDFG 1993). 

Verbena californica 

is threatened by urbanization, 
recreational placer gold mining, and potentially by overgrazing.

Federal government actions on these 10 plants began as a result 
of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 
U.S.C. 1533), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be 
endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This 
report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to 
Congress on January 9, 1975, and included 

Brodiaea pallida

 and 


Navarretia setiloba

 as endangered and 

Fritillaria striata

 and 

Lupinus 
citrinus

 var. 

deflexus

 as threatened. The Service published a notice 
in the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance 
of the report of the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the 
context of section 4(c)(2) (petition provisions are now found in 
section 4(b)(3) of the Act) and its intention thereby to review the 
status of the plant taxa named therein. The above four taxa were 
included in the July 1, 1975, notice. On June 16, 1976, the Service 
published a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to 
determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species to be endangered 
species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 plant 
taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the 
Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document 
No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 


Brodiaea pallida, Calyptridium pulchellum,

 and 

Navarretia setiloba

 
were included as endangered in the June 16, 1976, 

Federal Register

 
document. 

General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were 
summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 
17909). The Endangered Species Act amendments of 1978 required that 
all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period 
was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the 
December 10, 1979, 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796), the Service 
published a notice of withdrawal of the June 16, 1976, proposal, 
along with four other proposals that had expired. 

The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on 
December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). The notice included 

Allium 
tuolumnense

 (as 

Allium sanbornii

 var. 

tuolumnense

), 

Brodiaea pallida, 
Calyptridium pulchellum, Clarkia springvillensis, Fritillaria 
striata, Lupinus citrinus

 var. 

deflexus

 (as 

Lupinus deflexus

), 


Navarretia setiloba,

 and 

Verbena californica

 as category 1 candidates 
and 

Carpenteria californica

 as a category 2 candidate for Federal 
listing. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on 
file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats 
to support preparation of listing proposals. Category 2 species are 
those for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is 
possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biological 
vulnerability and threats are not currently known or on file to 
support rules. On November 28, 1983, the Service published in the 


Federal Register

 a supplement to the notice of review (48 FR 53640). 
This supplement contained 

Allium sanbornii

 var. 

tuolumnense, Brodiaea 
pallida,

 and 

Verbena californica

 as category 1 candidates for Federal 
listing. This supplement also elevated 

Carpenteria californica

 to a 
category 1 candidate and reclassified 

Clarkia springvillensis, 
Calyptridium pulchellum, Fritillaria striata, Lupinus citrinus

 var. 


deflexus,

 and 

Navarretia setiloba

 to category 2. This supplement 
also added 

Mimulus

 sp./sp. nov. ined. (Kern County) and 

Mimulus

 
sp./sp. nov. ined. (Tulare County) as a category 2 species. This 
species is now known as 

Mimulus shevockii.

 

The plant notice was revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 
39526). The status of these 10 plants remained unchanged from the 
1983 supplement. In the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice, 


Clarkia springvillensis, Navarretia setiloba,

 and 

Mimulus shevockii

 
were elevated to category 1 status. The status of the other seven 
taxa remained unchanged. In the September 30, 1993, plant notice of 
review (58 FR 51144), 

Calyptridium pulchellum

 was included as a 
category 2 species and the remaining nine taxa were included as 
category 1 species. Since publication of the 1990 notice and based 
on additional information received from botanists knowledgeable about 
the status of 

Calyptridium pulchellum, Fritillaria striata, and 
Lupinus citrinus

 var. 

deflexus,

 these species were placed in category 
1 by the Director's approval. 

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make 
certain findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their 
receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires 
that all petitions pending on October 13, 1983, be treated as having 
been newly submitted on that date. This was the case for 

Brodiaea 
pallida, Fritillaria striata, Lupinus citrinus

 var. 

deflexus,

 and 


Navarretia setiloba

 because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been 
accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that 
the petitioned listing of these species was warranted but was 
precluded by other pending listing actions in accordance with section 
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was 
published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires 
the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the 
Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1983 through 1993. 
Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding for the 
petitioned action.

Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and 
regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing 
provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to 
the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be endangered or 
threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in 
section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to

 Heckard and Bacigalupi (Kelso Creek

Navarretia setiloba

 Covelle (Piute Mountains

Verbena californica

 Moldenke (Red Hills vervain) are 
as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of their habitat or range. Brodiaea pallida, 
Calyptridium pulchellum, Clarkia springvillensis, Lupinus citrinus

 
var. 

deflexus, Mimulus shevockii, Allium tuolumnense, Carpenteria 
californica, Fritillaria striata, Navarretia setiloba,

 and 

Verbena 
californica

 are restricted to grassland and woodland communities in 
the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi Mountains in 
California. The primary threat facing these 10 plants is the ongoing 
and threatened destruction and adverse modification of their 
habitats. The habitats of these 10 plants are being threatened by 
one or more of the following: urbanization, agricultural land 
conversion, off-highway vehicle use, mining, road and rights-of-way 
maintenance associated with hydroelectric operations, logging, 
illegal dumping, incompatible fire management techniques, and highway 
construction and maintenance projects. 

The human populations in the counties where these species of 
plants occur are projected to grow significantly over the next 
decade. For example, Tuolumne County is projected to increase 46 
percent between 1992 and 2005, Fresno County is predicted to grow 53 
percent by 2005, and Tulare and Kern Counties are expected to 
increase 40 percent and 44 percent, respectively, by the year 2005 
(California Department of Finance 1991, 1992). The increase in 
housing construction that will likely accompany this population 
growth threatens the populations of the 10 plants that occur on 
privately owned land. 



Brodiaea pallida

 is only known from one population of 1,600 
plants in the Red Hills. A portion of the population was destroyed 
prior to 1982 (CNDDB 1993). A subdivision has been proposed for the 
area containing the remainder of the population. Although the 
project has apparently been revised to exclude most of the 

B. pallida

 
population from the area proposed for housing, the project is still 
expected to adversely affect the plant through its plan to encourage 
recreational activities in the area containing 

B. pallida.

 The 
project would also adversely affect this species because it would 
negatively impact the hydrological conditions necessary for growth 
and reproduction (Blaine Rogers, San Joaquin Delta College, 

in. 
litt.

, 1985). 

Six of the seven populations of 

Calyptridium pulchellum

 
contain fewer than 300 plants (CNDDB 1993). The seventh population 
of 

C. pulchellum

 contains approximately 800 plants. Residential 
development threatens four populations of 

C. pulchellum.

 Two 
populations of 

C. pulchellum

 occur on 1-acre lots that are for sale 
in the midst of an existing subdivision (CNDDB 1993). A third 
population of 

C. pulchellum

 occurs on a ranch that is for sale; the 
potential exists for the ranch to be subdivided after it is sold 
(CNDDB 1993). A fourth population of 

C. pulchellum

 occurs on a 
vacant lot adjacent to and downslope from a developed lot. Run-off 
from landscape maintenance of the developed lot threatens this 
population (CNDDB 1993). This fourth population has not been seen 
since 1983 and may be extirpated (CNDDB 1993). 

Disturbance associated with suburban foothill development 
destroyed part of one population of 

Lupinus citrinus

 var. 

deflexus

 in 
the early 1980s (CDFG 1989a). Since then, this population appears to 
be recovering (CDFG 1989a). The rapidly accelerating development of 
the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is a serious potential threat 
to all four populations of this species (CDFG 1989a). Presently, a 
home occupies each of the population sites south of the town of 
Mariposa in Mariposa County (California Native Plant Society (CNPS) 
1990). The construction of these homes destroyed some of the plants. 

The Joshua tree and pinyon-juniper woodland communities where 


Mimulus shevockii

 occurs are desirable for development because of 
their scenic viewsheds. Current mobile home development projects and 
associated road construction is adversely affecting 

M. shevockii

 at 
six sites; development projects planned for the future will also 
adversely affect this species (CNDDB 1993). Five of the populations 
of 

M. shevockii

 occur on a mixture of BLM and private lands and two 
populations occur on private lands. Parts of two populations have 
been destroyed by construction of a gravel road and an off-highway 
vehicle road (CNDDB 1993). Agricultural land conversion and mobile 
home lot development already have destroyed part of one of these 
populations and the remaining portion of this population is 
threatened with additional agricultural land conversion (CNDDB 1993).

Urbanization has destroyed one population of 

Allium 
tuolumnense.

 The type locality of 

A. tuolumnense

 once covered 
several hundred acres but has now been reduced to a total of 14 
hectares (35 acres) as a result of land clearing for housing 
construction (CNDDB 1993). Urbanization continues to threaten this 
population; the 17 hectare (40 acre) Heavenly Hills subdivision is 
proposed for this site (CNDDB 1993). The 220 hectare (540 acre) 
Gardella subdivision southwest of Jamestown has been recently 
proposed, and would adversely affect an additional population of 

A. 
tuolumnense

 (Robin Wood, Tuolumne County Planning Department, 

in 
litt.,

 1993, Skenfield 1992; Steve Stocking, San Joaquin Delta 
College, 

in. litt.,

 1993). A 760 hectare (1,890 acre) proposed 
subdivision called Shotgun Creek Estates would adversely affect 
another population northwest of Jamestown (CNDDB 1993). The above 
three proposed subdivisions could directly affect 

A. tuolumnense

 
through destruction of plants and habitat, or could indirectly affect 
the populations by altering the site hydrology through increased 
urban run-off of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, or by 
lowering the water table. 

As mentioned above, Fresno County is predicted to grow 53 
percent by the year 2005 (California Department of Finance 1991, 
1992). The development and construction of proposed subdivisions in 
Fresno County foothills will adversely affect the two populations of 


Carpenteria californica

 that occur on private land. These 
populations are already under threat from development projects (CNDDB 
1993). The expansion of a portion of State Highway 168 from a two-
lane to four-lane freeway partially destroyed and fragmented the 
largest population of 

C. californica

 (Joanna Clines, Sierra National 
Forest, pers. comm., 1993). The proposed realignment and expansion 
to four lanes of an additional section of the same highway 
potentially threatens portions of two populations of this plant 
(CNDDB 1993). 

The University of California proposes to establish a new campus 
at one of three sites in the San Joaquin Valley (University of 
California 1993), including a site in Fresno County at the base of 
the foothills where 

Carpenteria californica

 occurs. The proposed new 
campus at the Fresno location and the attendant growth-inducing 
effects of 40,000 to 50,000 people are a potential threat to 

C. 
californica

 (Howard Latimer, California State University, Fresno, 
pers. comm., 1993). 

The type locality of 

Clarkia springvillensis

 was destroyed by 
mobile home development in 1983 (CNPS 1988). Historically, road 
widening and cattle grazing have seriously reduced populations of 

C. 
springvillensis

 at six sites (CNPS 1988). Ongoing residential 
development, road maintenance activities, and timbering operations 
threaten three populations of 

C. springvillensis

 on private lands 
(CNDDB 1993). Prior to acquisition by CDFG, a preserve containing 
the largest population of 

C. springvillensis

 had an access road cut 
into the area, a well drilled, and a knoll levelled as a pad for home 
construction. These activities reduced and fragmented the population 
of 

C. springvillensis

 at that site. No restoration has occurred. 
One population of 

Navarretia setiloba

 occurs in a mobile home park 
(CNDDB 1993). Urbanization threatens two populations of 

N. setiloba

 
near Lake Isabella and one population on Grapevine Peak in Kern 
County (Diane Mitchell, botanist, pers. comm., 1992). The Andrews 
Creek population of 

Verbena californica,

 containing 25 percent of all 
the plants, is threatened with a proposed subdivision (CNDDB 1993, 
CDFG 1993; Robin Wood, 

in. litt.,

 1993). The Big Creek population of 
this plant, containing 40 percent of the population, is potentially 
threatened by residential development (Pat Stone, CNPS, pers comm., 
1992). 

Road maintenance activities adversely affect populations of 
several of the 10 plants included in this rule. Firebreak 
construction and road maintenance have destroyed part of one 
population of 

Allium tuolumnense

 (CNDDB 1993). The grading of access 
roads along hydroelectrical powerlines and the clearing of vegetation 
from powerlines and towers as part of hydroelectric operations of an 
electrical municipality potentially threaten one population of 


Carpenteria californica

 (CNDDB 1993). Historically, road widening 
and cattle grazing have seriously reduced populations of 

C. 
springvillensis

 at six sites (CNPS 1988). Two populations of 

C. 
springvillensis

 are currently threatened by road and fire break 
maintenance activities such as mowing and spraying (CNDDB 1993). 
Three of the four populations of 

C. springvillensis

 in the Sequoia 
National Forest occur along a road right-of-way for an electric 
municipality and are fenced and signed for protection but emergency 
maintenance activities, including vegetation removal, of the power 
towers and powerlines remains a threat (CNDDB 1993). A firebreak 
bisects one population of 

Fritillaria striata

 in Kern County and a 
powerline access road near Kern River State Park continues to 
adversely affect another population (CNDDB 1993). Vehicles driven 
along these access roads destroy the plants that grow in the roadway. 
Two populations of 

F. striata

 along Rancheria Road in Kern County 
face threats from a proposed road widening project (Stebbins 1989). 
Because of this species' affinity for clay soils that are unstable 
during wet months, emergency slope stabilization activities, such as 
road widening, could negatively affect two populations of 

F. striata

 
along Rancheria Road in Kern County (Stebbins 1989).

Small scale logging on the privately-owned lands within the 
boundary of the Sierra National Forest has destroyed some plants and 
continues to threaten some populations of 

Carpenteria californica

 (J. 
Clines, pers. comm., 1993). Heavy equipment is driven across the 
plant populations to access the logging sites, and some plants are 
destroyed. 

Proposed placer gold mining for a mining operation on private 
land threatens several populations of 

Allium tuolumnense

 (Robin Wood, 


in. litt.,

 1993; Pat Stone, 

in. litt.,

 1993). The proposed project 
is currently on hold. If planning were to resume, the resulting 
operation would adversely affect this plant through the placement of 
overburden on the plants occurring at these sites. Recreational gold 
mining and trampling associated with that activity adversely affects 
the four populations of 

Verbena californica

 at Six Bit Gulch, which 
contain 15 percent of the total individuals of the species (B. 
Rogers, pers. comm., 1992; CDFG 1993). 

Conversion of land to agricultural uses threatens three of the 
subject species. 

Fritillaria striata

 was once known from the Frazier 
Valley, Porterville, Lindsay, and Strathmore. Agricultural land 
conversion has extirpated four populations of 

F. striata

 from those 
areas (Stebbins 1989). Most of the existing known populations of 

F. 
striata

 are threatened by agricultural land conversion, overgrazing, 
competition from nonnative grasses, and urbanization (Stebbins 1989). 
The spread of citrus orchards threatens three populations of 

F. 
striata

 at the lower elevations on the slopes of Lewis Hill near 
Frazier Valley (Stebbins 1989, 1991). One population of 

Mimulus 
shevockii

 is threatened with agricultural land conversion (CNDDB 
1993). The type locality of 

Navarretia setiloba

 was extirpated by 
agricultural land conversion. 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, 
or educational purposes.

 Overutilization is not currently known to 
be a factor for these 10 plants but unrestricted collecting for 
scientific or horticultural purposes or excessive visits by 
individuals interested in seeing rare plants could result from 
increased publicity following publication of this proposal. 


Carpenteria californica

 is well established in the cultivation and 
horticultural trade both in California and England. The plant is 
propagated by cuttings and is not threatened by collecting in the 
wild. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 One population of 

Calyptridium 
pulchellum

 is potentially threatened by grazing (CNDDB 1993). Two 
populations of 

Verbena californica

 and eight populations of 

Allium 
tuolumnense

 that occur on lands managed by BLM in the Red Hills are 
grazed by cattle. Observations in Andrews Creek in the Red Hills 
indicate that 

Verbena californica

 is able to withstand only light 
grazing before it disappears (Rogers 1983). Plants of 

V. californica

 
were heavily cropped and noticeably smaller than in ungrazed sites 
(BioSystems Analysis 1984). Although current grazing levels do not 
appear to be adversely affecting these species, changes in timing or 
an increase in the number of animals grazing in the area is a 
potential threat to these populations. Moderate to heavy grazing 
adversely affects 

Clarkia springvillensis

 and 

Lupinus citrinus

 var. 


deflexus

 at five sites (CDFG 1987, CNPS 1990). The largest 
population of 

C. springvillensis,

 containing more plants than the 
other six populations combined, is protected in a 1.8 hectare (4.5 
acre) ecological preserve owned by the California Department of Fish 
and Game (CNDDB 1993). The preserve boundary was not surveyed. The 
original fence was placed some distance off the boundary line and 
included some adjacent land. This error has protected a substantial 
portion of the currently extant population of 

C. springvillensis

 from 
the heavy grazing that occurs outside the fenced exclosure. If, in 
the future, the fence is placed on the actual boundary, livestock 
grazing could adversely impact approximately half the remaining 

C. 
springvillensis

 on this site (CDFG 1989). Another population of 

C. 
springvillensis

 on the Sequoia National Forest is potentially 
threatened by overgrazing (CNDDB 1993). 

Heavy grazing by domestic livestock and rodents adversely 
affects three of four populations of 

Fritillaria striata

 in Kern 
County and a fourth population in Tulare County (Stebbins 1989, CNDDB 
1993). In addition to grazing, trampling of individual plants by 
livestock in populations in Kern County also negatively affects this 
species (Stebbins 1989, CNDDB 1993). Overgrazing currently adversely 
affects portions of two populations of 

Carpenteria californica

 in 
Fresno County (CNDDB 1993). 



Clarkia springvillensis

 is susceptible to predation by the 
larvae of sphinx moths (Sphingidae). Larvae of this moth were 
observed feeding on the plant at one site (CDFG 1987). Sphinx moth 
predation may occur at other sites as well. However, the extent to 
which this factor threatens the plant is not known. 

High numbers of California ground squirrels (

Spermophilus 
beecheyi

) frequently are associated with heavily grazed areas in the 
southern San Joaquin Valley and adjacent foothills. Ground squirrels 
likely feed on the subject plant species in addition to cattle in 
heavily grazed areas.

Deer were observed to have eaten most of the mature 
inflorescences of 

Fritillaria striata 

at the Tejoh Hills population 
(about 5,000 plants) during 1 week in 1987 (D. Taylor, pers. comm., 
1988 in Stebbins 1989). 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 

The 
California Fish and Game Commission has listed 

Brodiaea pallida 

and 


Clarkia springvillensis

 as endangered species under the California 
Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5  2050 

et seq.

 of the California 
Fish and Game Code and Title 14 California Code of Regulations 
670.2). The Commission also has listed 

Carpenteria californica, 
Fritillaria striata,

 and 

Lupinus deflexus

 (now known as 

Lupinus 
citrinus

 var. 

deflexus

) as threatened species. Listing by the State 
requires individuals to obtain a memorandum of understanding with the 
California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) to possess or ``take'' a 
listed species. Although both the California Native Plant Protection 
Act and the California Endangered Species Act prohibit the ``take'' of 
State-listed plants, State law exempts the taking of such plants via 
habitat modification or land use changes by the owner. After CDFG 
notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her 
property, State law only requires that the land owner notify the 
agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow 
salvage of such a plant'' (Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10  
1913). 

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a full 
disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed 
projects. The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction 
over the project is designated as the lead agency, and is responsible 
for conducting a review of the project and consulting with the other 
agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. 
Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of 
significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or 
restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Species 
that are eligible for listing as rare, threatened, or endangered but 
are not so listed are given the same protection as those species that 
are officially listed with the State or Federal governments. Once 
significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option to 
require mitigation for effects through changes in the project or to 
decide that overriding considerations make mitigation infeasible. In 
the latter case, projects may be approved even though they may cause 
significant environmental damage, such as destruction of an 
endangered species. Protection of listed species through CEQA is, 
therefore, dependent upon the discretion of the agency involved. 



Verbena californica

 and 

Brodiaea pallida

 grow in mesic areas 
along defined stream channels that are generally small and may be 
treated as isolated wetlands or waters of the United States for 
regulatory purposes by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 
404 of the Clean Water Act. Nationwide Permit No. 26 (33 CFR part 
330.5 (a)(26)) was established by the Corps to facilitate issuance of 
permits for discharge of fill into wetlands up to 4 hectares (10 
acres). For project proposals falling under Nationwide Permit 26, 
the Corps has been reluctant to withhold authorization unless a 
federally proposed or listed threatened or endangered species is 
known to be present, regardless of the significance of other wetland 
resources. The 404 regulations require an applicant to obtain an 
individual permit to fill isolated wetlands or waters greater than 4 
hectares (10 acres). In either case, candidate species receive no 
special consideration. Additionally and equally important, the 
upland watersheds (mesic pools and seeps next to streams) are not 
provided any protection. Disturbance to or loss of pool hydrology 
has damaged populations and habitat of these two plants as discussed 
previously in Factor A. Reductions in water volume and inundation 
adversely affect these plants. Thus, as a consequence of the small 
scale of these stream channels and lack of protection of associated 
uplands, this regulatory mechanism is inadequate to protect these two 
species. 

Of the 10 plants included in this proposed rule, only 

Clarkia 
springvillensis, Calyptridium pulchellum,

 and 

Carpenteria californica

 
receive any kind of formal protection. 

The largest population of 

Clarkia springvillensis

 occurs on a 
1.8 hectare (4.5 acre) preserve owned by the California Department of 
Fish and Game (CDFG). A draft interim management plan was developed 
in 1989, but has not been finalized in part due to a lack of funding. 
No on-the-ground management of this population has occurred. The 
Sequoia National Forest developed a management plan in 1987 for the 
populations of 

C. springvillensis

 that occur on Forest Service land. 
Although three of the four populations are now fenced, no active 
management of the populations is occurring to protect and promote the 
recovery of the species. 

One portion of a population of 

Carpenteria californica

 is 
protected at the Black Mountain Preserve, owned by The Nature 
Conservancy. Some recovery activities such as prescribed burns are 
not being conducted because of a lack of funding and concerns that 
prescribed burns would result in a wildfire (J. Clines, pers. comm., 
1993). The Sierra National Forest has designated and fenced a 
botanical area for the preservation of one portion of a population of 


C. californica,

 but no active management is taking place to enhance 
and promote the recovery of the species.

One small population of 

Calyptridium pulchellum

 occurs on lands 
administered by the Sierra National Forest and is fenced to protect 
it from livestock trampling and grazing (J. Clines, pers. comm., 
1993). However, the remaining populations are not protected. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued 
existence. 

Low seedling establishment, trampling, competition from 
native brush, off-road vehicle (ORV) activity, potential realignment 
of a preserve boundary fence, fire suppression, illegal dumping, and 
stochastic extinction variously affect some populations of 

Brodiaea 
pallida, Clarkia springvillensis, Fritillaria striata,

 and 


Carpenteria californica.



ORV use has destroyed some plants in the past at one population 
of 

Lupinus citrinus

 var. 

deflexus,

 however, recent damage is not 
evident (CDFG 1989a). An ORV road bisects one population of 

Mimulus 
shevockii

 and a gravel road bisects another population (CNDDB 1993). 
Ongoing ORV activity threatens this plant. Two populations of 

Allium 
tuolumnense

 were partially destroyed by ORV use in the Red Hills (The 
Nature Conservancy 1987), which is currently closed to ORVs. ORV use 
threatens four populations of 

Carpenteria californica

 (CNDDB 1993). 
One population of 

Navarretia setiloba

 in Kern County has received 
some disturbance from ORV use (CNDDB 1993), and another population is 
bisected by an ORV road (CNDDB 1993). 

The single, small population of 

Brodiaea pallida

 is restricted 
to an intermittent drainage that is fed by some small springs. Any 
disruption to the hydrology of the springs or the upslope watershed 
would threaten this population of 

B. pallida.

 Local catastrophic 
events such as floods, disease outbreak, extended drought, 
landslides, or a combination of several such events could destroy a 
part or all of the population of 

B. pallida.

 Any local catastrophe 
could significantly decrease this population to so few individuals 
that the risk of extirpation due to genetic problems associated with 
small populations would increase. 

Plants at one population of 

Fritillaria striata

 in Kern County 
have been trampled by cattle, and an additional population is 
potentially threatened by trampling (CNDDB 1993). 

Because no seedlings of 

Fritillaria striata

 have been observed 
in nature, it is unknown to what degree this species is reproducing 
sexually (Stebbins 1989). The distribution of 

F. striata

 may be 
limited partially by its apparent reliance on vegetative reproduction 
(Stebbins 1989). The populations of this plant are discontinuously 
distributed throughout its range, making sexual reproduction 
difficult. By relying solely on vegetative reproduction, the genetic 
diversity of the species can be reduced, weakening the long-term 
viability of the species. 

Fritillaria striata

 also faces threats 
from nonnative grasses such as 

Avena

 and 

Bromus

 that compete with the subject plant for space, light, and nutrients (Stebbins 1989). 

Fire suppression on private lands is a threat to the long-term 
survival of 

Carpenteria californica

 (J. Clines, pers. comm., 1993). 


Carpenteria californica

 exhibits low seedling establishment (CDFG 
1991). The germination and seedling establishment of 

C. californica

 
in nature was not observed or documented prior to 1989. However, a 
1989 wildfire in Fresno County stimulated vigorous regrowth of the 
plant and the first recorded seedling establishment (J. Clines, 

in. 
litt

., 1993). Overgrazing and trampling by cattle directly after a 
wildfire, when seedlings are vulnerable, adversely affects the plant. 


Carpenteria californica

 requires more frequent fire than that is 
currently being experienced for successful sexual reproduction to 
occur (J. Clines, 

in. litt

., 1993). Fire is also important for 
maintaining the vigor of established individual shrubs of 

C. 
californica

, by preventing associated species such as 

Quercus 
wislizenii, Arctostaphylos mariposa

, and 

Ceanothus leucodermis

 from 
outcompeting 

C. californica

 for light, space, and nutrients (J. 
Clines, 

in. litt

., 1993). 

Because the private lands containing the populations of 


Carpenteria californica

 consist of many small ranchettes and multiple 
landowners, it is unlikely that a controlled burn over an area large 
enough to effectively promote necessary sexual reproduction of 

C. 
californica

 could be successfully organized and carried out. 
Continued fire suppression and the inability to conduct needed 
controlled burns on private lands threaten all populations of 

C. 
californica

 that occur on private lands. The necessity of fire for 
sexual reproduction and for the long-term survival of this plant is 
understood by the Sierra National Forest. The policy of continued 
fire suppression to protect upslope timber stands is a threat to 
populations of 

C. californica

 on public lands. 

Illegal dumping has been reported at two populations of 


Carpenteria californica

 (Stebbins 1988). Trash dumping destroys 
individual plants and degrades the habitat by introducing a wide 
variety of pollutants that inhibit seed germination and plant growth.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to propose this rule. Endangered or threatened
status is proposed for these species because large-scale human population increases and attendant urban growth
and changes in agricultural land uses have destroyed significant quantities of foothill habitats and continue to
eliminate plant populations. These plants and their habitats face current and future threats from urbanization,
agricultural land conversion, highway construction, overgrazing, maintenance of roads and rights-of-way activities,
mining, logging, off-highway vehicle use, stochastic extinction from random natural events, inadequate regulatory
mechanisms, and insect predation.

Because the majority of threats facing four of these species are imminent, 

Brodiaea pallida, Calyptridium pulchellum, Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus, 

and 

Mimulus shevockii 

are in immediate danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their respective ranges and, thus,
fit the definition of an endangered species as defined in the Act. The only population of 

Brodiaea pallida 

is threatened by urbanization, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and stochastic extinction. Four of the seven
populations of 

Calyptridium pulchellum 

are imminently threatened by urbanization; one of those four sites is threatened potentially by overgrazing and
an additional population threatened by grazing. Although TNC has voluntary verbal protection agreements with current
landowners of one of the populations, no permanent preservation is assured at any of the populations sites. All four
populations of 

Lupinus citrinus 

var. 

deflexus 

are threatened by urbanization and one population is potentially threatened by overgrazing. Although landowners
of three of the four populations have registered each site with TNC for voluntary protection, no long-term protection
is assured for any of the four known populations. Six of the seven known populations of 

Mimulus shevockii 

are threatened variously by mobile home development, agricultural land conversion, and off-highway vehicle use.
None of the populations have any protection.

The plants proposed for listing as threatened are restricted to habitats somewhat less vulnerable to development
and are faced with less imminent threats. However, these species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable
future unless current trends of urban development, agricultural land conversion, highway construction, road maintenance
activities, improper fire management, off-highway vehicle use, and overgrazing are reversed. 

Allium tuolumnense 

is threatened by urbanization, overgrazing, mining, and off-highway vehicle use on 25 percent of its range on private
lands. The remaining 75 percent of the population occurs on public lands and is potentially threatened by grazing
on public lands. 

Carpenteria californica 

is imminently threatened by urbanization, highway construction, maintenance of roads and rights-of-way in connection
with hydroelectrical operations, competition from native brush species, logging, illegal dumping, incompatible
fire management activities, overgrazing, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and off-highway vehicle use over
the one-third of its range on private lands. 

Carpenteria californica 

is potentially threatened by alteration of natural fire cycles, off-highway vehicle use, and maintenance of roads
and rights-of-way on the remaining two-thirds of its range on public lands. Four of the seven populations of 

Clarkia springvillensis 

are threatened by urbanization, road maintenance activities, insect predation, overgrazing, inadequate regulatory
mechanisms, and timber operations. The largest population is protected partially by a fenced preserve owned by the
California Department of Fish and Game. A possible fence realignment potentially threatens a significant portion
of this population. Although three of the four populations of 

C. springvillensis 

occurring on the Sequoia National Forest are fenced and signed for protection, those populations may be threatened
by future emergency powerline maintenance. Of the 17 populations of 

Fritillaria striata, 

9 populations are threatened variously by agricultural land conversion, urbanization, off-highway vehicle use,
road widening, emergency road maintenance activities, overgrazing, and trampling. Additionally, all populations
of 

F. striata 

are potentially threatened by inadequate State regulatory mechanisms and competition from nonnative grasses.
Three of the six populations of 

Navarretia setiloba 

are threatened by urbanization and off-highway vehicle use. Seven of the nine populations of 

Verbena californica, 

containing 65 percent of the plants, are threatened by urbanization over a relatively small part of its range on private
lands. Recreational placer gold mining threatens this plant and overgrazing potentially threatens this plant on
its remaining range on public lands. These six plants are not yet in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant
portion of their ranges, but appear likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. As a result,
the preferred action is to list 

Allium tuolumnense, Carpenteria californica, Clarkia springvillensis, Fritillaria striata, Navarretia setiloba,


and 

Verbena californica 

as threatened species.

Critical Habitat



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate
critical habitat at the time the taxa is listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent
for these species at this time. Because the 10 plants face numerous anthropogenic threats (see Factors A and E in ``Summary
of Factors Affecting the Species'') and the 10 plants occur predominantly on private land, the publication of precise
maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

 would make these plants more vulnerable to incidents of vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to the decline
of these species and increase enforcement problems. The listing of these species under the Act publicizes the rarity
of these plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers or collectors of rare plants.

Protection of the habitat of these species will be addressed through the section 7 consultation and section 4 recovery
processes. The Service believes that Federal involvement in the areas where these plants occur can be identified
without the designation of critical habitat. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat
for these plants is not prudent at this time, because such designation would likely increase the degree of threat from
vandalism, collecting, or other human activities.



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of
the Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

Federal activities potentially affecting 1 or more of the 10 plants include mining, grazing authorizations, and
issuance of special use permits and rights-of-ways. Populations of 7 of the 10 plants occur on Federal lands. Approximately
70 percent of the 

Carpenteria californica, 

half the populations of 

Clarkia springvillensis, 

and one population of 

Calyptridium pulchellum 

occur on lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Approximately one-third of the populations of Allium tuolumnense,
one-seventh the populations of 

Verbena californica, 

one-half the populations of 

Mimulus shevockii, 

and one population of 

Navarretia setiloba 

occur on lands managed by the BLM. These agencies would be required to confer with the Service if any activities authorized,
funded, or carried out by these two agencies would likely jeopardize the continued existence of these species.

Other Federal agencies that may become involved as a result of this proposed rule include the Veterans Administration
through their Federal mortgage programs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (Federal Home Administration
loans), and the Federal Highways Administration through the construction of roads and highways. Since at least three
of these plants exist in or near stream beds, perennial streams or drainages, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may become
involved through jurisdiction of section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Listing these 10 plants would provide for the development of recovery plans. Such plans would bring together both
State and Federal efforts for conservation of the plants. The plans would establish a framework for agencies to coordinate
activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plans would set recovery priorities and estimate
costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It also would describe site-specific management actions necessary
to achieve conservation and survival of these 10 plants. Additionally, pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Service
would be able to grant funds to affected States for management actions promoting the protection and recovery of these
species.

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plants and 17.71 and
17.72 for threatened plants not covered by a special rule, set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that apply
to listed plant species. With respect to the four plants proposed to be listed as endangered, the prohibitions of section
9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect
to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export; transport
in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale these species in interstate
or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession these species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously
damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy
any such endangered plant species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course
of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.

The six plants proposed to be listed as threatened would be subject to similar prohibitions (16 U.S.C. 1538(a)(2)(E);
50 CFR 17.61, 17.71). Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions
provided that a statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 also provide for
the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species
under certain circumstances. The Service anticipates that trade permits may be sought or issued for at least 1 of these
10 plant species because 

Carpenteria californica 

is common in cultivation in England and California. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries
regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,
911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063; FAX 503/231-6243).



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning:
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to these taxa;

(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of these species; and

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on these species.

Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received
by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal.

The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received
within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the
Field Supervisor of the Sacramento Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES 

section).



National Environmental Policy Act



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant

From California

ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of
1973, as amended (Act) for 

Lessingia germanorum

 (San Francisco lessingia), and threatened status for 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 (San Bruno Mountain manzanita), two plants from the San Francisco peninsula of California. 

Lessingia germanorum

 occurs in central dune scrub, and is known from five sites on the Presidio in San Francisco County, and one site on San
Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County, California. This taxon has been affected by and is endangered by competition with
invasive alien vegetation, residential and commercial development, sand quarrying, increased pedestrian traffic
and recreational activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, bulldozing, shading by native and non-native
vegetation, incidental use of fertilizers, and other anthropogenic activities. 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 occurs in coastal scrub habitat, and is only known from five small populations on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County;
this plant has been affected by and is vulnerable to changes in fire frequency. This taxon is also threatened by collection,
as it is used horticulturally as an ornamental plant. Because of the limited number of extant individuals of 

A. imbricata

 and 

L. germanorum

 and their severely restricted distribution, they also are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction from
stochastic events. This proposal, if made final, would implement the Federal protection and recovery provisions
afforded by the Act for these plants.

Background





Lessingia germanorum

 (San Francisco lessingia) and 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 (San Bruno Mountain manzanita) are endemic to the northern San Francisco peninsula in California. 

Lessingia germanorum

 is found within the central dune scrub community. 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 is a component of the coastal scrub community.

The natural communities of the northern San Francisco peninsula have undergone a number of changes as a result of human-caused
activities. The northern part of the San Francisco peninsula is highly urbanized. By 1984, over 90 percent of the northern
peninsula's natural habitat had been disturbed or eliminated (Orsak and Schooley 1984). Urbanization has eliminated


Lessingia germanorum

 from part of its range, and intensive commercial and residential development are ongoing. San Bruno Mountain was
the last large parcel of open space in the northern San Francisco peninsula, and pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of
the Act, was the site of the United States' first habitat conservation plan after a decade-long land use battle (Bean


et al.

 1991). Urban development also has fragmented the remaining habitats for these plants. Habitat fragmentation increases
the risks of extinction due to chance events such as pest or disease outbreaks, reproductive failure (which is possibly
devastating to annual plants), or other natural or human-caused disasters. Other anthropogenic activities such
as sand quarrying, increased pedestrian traffic and recreational activities, change in fire frequency, bulldozing,
or the incidental use of fertilizers, also variously threaten the remaining occurrences of these plants.



Discussion of the Two Species Proposed for Listing



Adelbert von Chamisso first collected 

Lessingia germanorum

 in 1816 on the sand hills of San Francisco, California (Howell 1929). Chamisso described 

L. germanorum

 in 1829 and named it in honor of the Lessings, a German family of scientists and authors. John Thomas Howell (1929) recognized
11 varieties of 

L. germanorum.

 According to the rules for botanical nomenclature, when a new subspecies is described in a species not previously
divided into infraspecific taxa, an autonym (an automatically created name) is created (i.e. 

Lessingia germanorum

 var. 

germanorum

). Howell distinguished 

L. germanorum

 var. 

germanorum

 from the other varieties by the presence of few glands and by the absence of either odorous or bitter glandular secretions.
Other treatments (Ferris 1959, Munz and Keck 1968) also recognized varieties of 

L. germanorum.

 Currently 

L. germanorum

 is recognized as a distinct species (Lane 1993).



Lessingia germanorum

 is a slender annual of the aster family (Asteraceae) with diffusely branched stems 10 to 30 centimeters (cm) (4 to 12
inches (in)) high. The herbage and stems are glandless and covered with grayish, loosely interwoven hairs. Tubular
lemon yellow disc flowers with a brownish or purplish band are clustered into heads that are solitary at the end of branchlets.
The seeds, which are attached to a crown of hairlike bristles, are light and easily carried by the wind. 

Lessingia germanorum

 typically flowers between August and November.

Historically, 

Lessingia germanorum

 occurred within the coastal dune scrub community throughout the San Francisco peninsula. Currently 

L. germanorum

 is restricted to the Presidio area of the San Francisco peninsula, and one occurrence near the base of San Bruno Mountain.


L. germanorum

 grows on remnant sand dunes and sand terraces in open areas with blowing sand (Susan Smith, Yerba Buena Chapter, California
Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1992), at an elevational range between 24 to 91 meters (m) (80 to 300 feet (ft)).
It is associated with 

Chorizanthe cuspidata, Lotus scoparius,

 and 

Lupinus arboreous

 (or 

Lupinus chamissonis

). Five small populations, four natural and one introduced, occur within the Presidio in San Francisco County. One
of the populations on the Presidio was established after approximately 10 cubic yards of sand was removed from the
site of another population for use on the base golf course. In 1989, an additional population was discovered on San
Bruno Mountain in northern San Mateo County. Collectively, the populations inhabit less than 0.8 hectares (2 acres)
(Terri Thomas, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, pers. comm., 1993; Paul Reeberg, National Park Service, pers.
comm., 1993). Population numbers for 

L. germanorum

 vary from year to year, but from 1980 to 1989 the total on the Presidio was less than 1,500 individuals per year (California
Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) 1989). The population on San Bruno Mountain is estimated to have 1,600 to 1,800 individuals
(Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993). The five small populations within the Presidio have been managed by the Department
of Defense but will be transferred to the National Park Service effective October 1, 1994. The population on San Bruno
Mountain is jointly owned by Daly City and a private landowner (Annemarie Quevedo, Assistant Planner for Daly City,


in litt.,

 1992).

The populations on the Presidio are threatened by competition 
with invasive alien vegetation, shading from native and introduced 
shrubs and trees, foot traffic, sand quarrying, bulldozing, and other 
anthropogenic activities (CDFG 1989; California Natural Diversity 
Database (CNDDB) 1992; Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992; Paul Reeberg, 
pers. comm., 1993; Terri Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). The population 
located on San Bruno Mountain is threatened by urbanization, 
trampling, competition from invasive alien vegetation, and bulldozing 
(Thomas Reid Associates, 

in litt, 

1991; Susan Smith, pers. comm., 
1992; Paul Reeberg, pers comm., 1993). Both the Presidio and San 
Bruno Mountain populations are threatened by stochastic environmental 
events. 
Alice Eastwood (1931) originally described 

Arctostaphylos 
imbricata 

in 1931, based on material collected from the San Bruno 
Hills in 1915. Until 1967, various authors either synonymized 

A. 
imbricata 

with 

A. andersonii 

(Jepson 1939), or considered it to be a 
variety of 

A. andersonii 

(Adams in McMinn 1935). James Roof followed 
Eastwood's treatment and acknowledged 

A. imbricata 

as a distinct 
species (Roof 1967). Philip Wells (1988) subsumed 

A. montariensis 

as 
a subspecies of 

A. imbricata, 

necessitating the creation of an 
autonym as discussed above (i.e., 

A. imbricata 

ssp. 

imbricata

). He 
since has recognized 

A. imbricata 

as a distinct species in his 1993 
treatment of California 

Arctostaphylos 

(Wells 1993). 


Arctostaphylos imbricata 

is a low spreading evergreen shrub of 
the heath family (Ericaceae) that lacks a basal burl. Attaining a 
height of 20 cm (8 in), this highly branched shrub forms mats that 
are up to about 6 meters (m) (6 yards (yd)) in diameter. The bright 
green oblong to ovate leaves are hairless, except on the midrib, and 
densely overlapping. Small white urn-shaped flowers appearing from 
February to May are densely clustered at the end of branchlets. 
After fire, 

A. imbricata 

regenerates from seed instead of resprouting 
from a basal burl. 

A. imbricata 

can be distinguished from its 
congeners by its prostrate habit and its shorter, densely arranged 
leaves and compact flower clusters (Roof 1967). 


Arctostaphylos imbricata 

is restricted to San Bruno Mountain in 
northern San Mateo County. On San Bruno Mountain, five small 
occurrences cover approximately 80 hectares (33 acres) (Paul Reeberg, 


in litt., 

1993). The most abundant population has 400 to 500 plants; 
other populations have as few as 15 plants (Roman Gankin, San Mateo 
County Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). The plant grows in 
rocky exposed areas such as open ridges within coastal scrub or 
manzanita scrub at an elevation range of 275 to 365 m (900 to 1,200 
ft). Where it occurs, it is the dominant plant species, and may be 
associated with 

Baccharis pilularis 

(coyote brush), 

Vaccinium ovatum 


(huckleberry), 

Rhamnus californica 

(coffeeberry), and 

Arctostaphylos 
uva-ursi 

var. 

suborbiculata 

(bearberry). 

A. imbricata 

has never been 
known from more than the five populations that occur today. Four of 
the five populations occur on land owned by San Mateo County Parks 
and Recreation; the fifth population is privately owned (Thomas Reid 
Associates 1991). The proximity of this plant on San Bruno Mountain 
to human population centers and intensive development activities 
renders 

A. imbricata 

vulnerable to change in the frequency of fires 
(i.e., as a result of a fire suppression policy), which are needed 
for the plants to reproduce sexually. Its highly restricted 
distribution increases its susceptibility to catastrophic events such 
as disease or pest outbreak, severe drought, or other natural or 
human-caused disasters. 


Previous Federal Action 


Federal government actions on the two plants began on June 16, 
1976, when the Service published a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 
(41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species 
to be endangered pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The list of 1,700 
plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received 
by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House 
Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 
publication. 

Arctostaphylos imbricata 

was included in the June 16, 
1976, 

Federal Register

 document. 
General comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were 
summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 
17909). The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 required that 
all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period 
was given to those proposals already more than 2 years old. In the 
December 10, 1979, 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796), the Service 
published a notice of withdrawal of the June 16, 1976, proposal, 
along with four other proposals that had expired. 
The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on 
December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included 

Arctostaphylos 
imbricata 

and 

Lessingia germanorum 

(as 

Lessingia germanorum 

var. 

germanorum

) as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial

information on biological vulnerability and threats to support 
preparation of listing proposals. On November 28, 1983, the Service 
published in the 

Federal Register

 a supplement to the Notice of 
Review (48 FR 53640). This supplement changed 

L. germanorum 

var. 


germanorum 

from a category 1 to a category 2 candidate. Category 2 
taxa are those for which data in the Service's possession indicate 
listing is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on 
biological vulnerability and threats are not currently known or on 
file to support proposed rules.

The plant notice was revised again on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 
39526). 

Arctostaphylos imbricata 

and 

Lessingia germanorum 

var. 


germanorum 

were included as category 1 candidates. Both species 
retained category 1 status in the most recent revision of the plant 
notice published on February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184). 


Mr. Brian O'Neill, General Superintendent of the Golden Gate 
National Recreation Area, petitioned the Service to emergency list 


Lessingia germanorum 

as an endangered species on May 28, 1991. 
Although the Service did not emergency list 

Lessingia germanorum, 

it 
did publish a 90-day finding in the 

Federal Register

 on August 19, 
1992 (57 FR 37513) that substantial information had been presented 
indicating that listing may be warranted. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 
Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions found to 
present substantial information indicating that the petitioned action 
may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. The Service has 
conducted a status review and determined that the petitioned action 
is warranted. Publication of this proposed rule constitutes the 
final finding for the petitioned action. 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR 
Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act 
set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of 
threatened and endangered species. A species may be determined to be 
endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors 
described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 


Lessingia germanorum 

Cham. (San Francisco lessingia) and 


Arctostaphylos imbricata 

Eastw. (San Bruno Mountain manzanita) are as 
follows: 
A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range. 

Threats facing the habitat of 
these plants include being threatened, eliminated, or adversely 
modified by one or more of the following: urbanization, change in 
fire frequency, competition with invasive alien vegetation, sand 
quarrying, off-road vehicles, bulldozing, foot traffic, and bicycle 
use. 
The natural habitat of the San Francisco peninsula already has 
been severely curtailed due to urbanization. Historically, suitable 


Lessingia germanorum 

habitat has decreased by 90 percent since 
European settlement (CDFG 1990). Urban development extirpated 
populations of 

L. germanorum 

at Lone Mountain and Lake Merced (both 
in the City of San Francisco) (CNDDB 1992). Historical populations 
of 

L. germanorum 

at Mountain View Lake and Ocean View Downs also have 
been extirpated, presumably due to urban development and competition 
with invasive alien vegetation (CDFG 1989). On San Bruno Mountain, 
approximately 4 hectares (10 acres) of potential habitat remains for 


L. germanorum 

(Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993). Although it is 
unlikely that any additional significant populations will be located 
in this area, the area may be important for reintroduction efforts. 
Most of the central dune scrub on San Bruno Mountain has been covered 
by ``homes, cemeteries, a flower farm, and the Colma Dump'' (McClintock 


et al. 

1990). 
Urban development potentially threatens the population of 


Lessingia germanorum 

that occurs on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo 
County outside the boundary for the San Bruno Mountain HCP (Paul 
Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993) (for a discussion of the HCP, see Factor 
D). A project has been approved for the construction of seven 
additional dwellings within a few hundred yards of the San Bruno 
population (Annemarie Quevedo, pers. comm., 1993). Activities 
associated with this development, such as trampling, would adversely 
affect this population. 
Fragmentation of the coastal scrub dune community caused by 
past urban development also threatens this species. Habitat 
fragmentation has two primary effects. First, habitat fragmentation 
may alter the physical environment, changing the amount of incoming 
solar radiation, water, wind, or nutrients where the remnant 
vegetation occurs (Saunders 

et al. 

1991). Second, when populations 
are fragmented into smaller, isolated units, risks of extinction due 
to chance events increases (see Factor E). 
The habitat of 

Lessingia germanorum 

has been altered by the 
introduction of non-native vegetation. 

L. germanorum 

requires 
blowing sand and non-compacted soils. Off-road vehicle use, foot and 
bicycle traffic, and trampling by joggers compacts the soil and 
promotes the establishment of invasive alien vegetation (CDFG 1989; 
Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992). All populations of 

L. germanorum 


are threatened by competition with aggressive alien plant species. 


Carpobrotus 

sp. (ice plant) covers extensive dune areas on the 
Presidio, stabilizing the dune system where it occurs. 

L. germanorum 


in contrast, requires some dune movement, which results in areas of 
exposed sand (CDFG 1989). Ice plant competes with 

L. germanorum 

at 
all five occurrences on the Presidio. In addition to ice plant, 
other alien plants competing with 

L. germanorum, 

include 

Bromus 
diandrus, Avena barbata, Rumex 

sp., 

Raphanus 

sp., and 

Sonchus 

sp. 
(Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992). On San Bruno Mountain 

Cortaderia 


sp. (pampas grass) encroachment is a severe threat. CDFG reported 
that ``without special protection and management, San Francisco 
lessingia will continue its declining trend'' (CDFG 1992). Currently 
the populations of 

L. germanorum 

are being weeded by volunteers from 
the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Without their 
assistance, 

L. germanorum 

would be outcompeted by the invasive alien 
vegetation.

<TEXT>
 

The habitat of 

Lessingia germanorum 

also has been modified at 
one site by tree planting. Native and introduced shrubs and trees, 
including 

Pinus radiata

, were planted at the Presidio in the late 
1800's. These trees alter the habitat of 

L

. 

germanorum 

by increasing 
the amount of shade (CDFG 1989; CNDDB 1992; Susan Smith, pers. comm., 
1992), which adversely affects 

L

. 

germanorum

. 

Bulldozing and sand quarrying activities have adversely 
affected 

Lessingia germanorum

. Bulldozing to stabilize a slope on 
San Bruno Mountain destroyed about one-eighth of the 

L

. 

germanorum 


population (Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993; Thomas Reid Associates, 


in litt

., 1991). In January 1989, most of the habitat for one 
population of 

L

. 

germanorum 

on the Presidio was destroyed when sand 
was removed to repair a tee on the base golf course (CDFG 1990). 
Sand quarrying is an on-going threat at this site; any sand quarrying 
activities that may occur in the future would negatively impact this 
species. 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, 
or educational purposes

. Overutilization currently is not known to 
be a factor for 

Lessingia germanorum

. Overutilization is potentially 
a threat to 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

, which is used horticulturally 
as an ornamental plant. Two years ago, cuttings were made from 
plants located at Kamchatka Point on San Bruno Mountain. The remnant 
portions of the plants indicated that the clippings were performed 
with horticultural expertise (Doug Heisinger, Park Ranger, San Mateo 
County Park, pers. comm., 1993). Some 

A

. 

imbricata 

being sold at 
local plant sales may originate from clippings from the natural 
populations (Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993). Unrestricted 
collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes or excessive 
visits by groups or individuals interested in seeing rare plants 
could potentially result from increased publicity following 
publication of a proposed rule to list these species. 

C. 

Disease or predation

. There are no known disease or 
predation threats to 

Lessingia germanorum 

or 

Arctostaphylos imbricata 


at this time. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms

. The State 
of California Fish and Game Commission has listed 

Arctostaphylos 
imbricata 

and 

Lessingia germanorum 

as endangered species under the 
California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5  2050 

et seq

. of the 
California Fish and Game Code and Title 14 California Code of 
Regulations 670.2). Listing by the State of California requires 
individuals to obtain a memorandum of understanding with the CDFG to 
possess or ``take'' a listed species. Though both the California 
Endangered Species Act and the California Native Plant Protection Act 
prohibit the ``take'' of State-listed plants (California Native Plant 
Protection Act, Chapter 10  1908 and California Endangered Species 
Act, Chapter 1.5  2080), State law exempts the taking of such plants 
via habitat modification or land use changes by the owner. After 
CDFG notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or 
her property, State law only requires that the land owner notify the 
agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow 
salvage of such a plant'' (Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10  
1913). 

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a full 
disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed 
projects. The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction 
over the project is designated as the lead agency, and is responsible 
for conducting a review of the project and consulting with the other 
agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. 
Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of 
significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or 
restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Species 
that are eligible for listing as rare, threatened, or endangered but 
are not so listed are given the same protection as those species that 
are officially listed with the State or Federal governments. Once 
significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option to 
require mitigation for effects through changes in the project or to 
decide that overriding considerations make mitigation infeasible. In 
the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant 
environmental damage, such as destruction of endangered species. 
Protection of listed species through CEQA is, therefore, dependant 
upon the discretion of the lead agency.

CEQA pertains to projects that occur on lands other than 
Federal land. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires 
disclosure of the environmental effects of projects on Federal lands. 
Certain actions can be categorically excluded from the NEPA process 
when (a) the action or group of actions would have no significant 
effect on the quality of the human environment, and (b) the actions 
or group of actions would not involve unresolved conflicts concerning 
alternative uses of available resources. Exceptions to the 
categorical exclusions exist. One of these exceptions is when the 
action would affect a species listed or proposed to be listed on the 
List of Endangered or Threatened Species. Until a species is 
federally listed or proposed, this exception to the categorical 
exclusion would not be applied regardless of the State listing 
status. 

A Memorandum of Understanding was established in 1987 between 
the Service, the National Park Service, Department of Defense, and 
CDFG for the purposes of mutual cooperation for management of 
sensitive native plant communities on the Presidio. However, 


Lessingia germanorum 

is not specifically addressed in the document 
(CDFG 1989). Sand quarrying and other activities that were 
endangering it have not been prevented and continue to threaten the 
species with extinction. 



Arctostaphylos imbricata 

currently derives limited protection 
from the San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). An HCP, 
pursuant to sections 10(a)(1)(B) and 10(a)(2)(A) of the Act, is 
required for the Service to issue a permit for incidental take of a 
federally listed species of wildlife when such taking is incidental 
to, and not the primary purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. 
HCPs are the mechanism through which incidental take of federally 
listed animals can be permitted for non-Federal actions. Future 
actions that are part of the permit are subject to review under 
section 7 of the Act. 

The San Bruno Mountain HCP, developed in 1983 for three listed 
animals, also identified several candidate species in the area of 
concern, including 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

. However, no species-specific management actions for 

A

. 

imbricata

 are identified in the 
HCP, and none have been implemented. The protection to this plant 
afforded by the HCP may, therefore, be inadequate to insure its 
long-term survival. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued 
existence. 

As discussed in Factor A, off-road vehicle use, foot and 
bicycle traffic, and trampling by joggers degrade the habitat of 


Lessingia germanorum. 

These activities also directly destroy 
individual plants. A bike path runs through the middle of one of the 
populations of 

L. germanorum

 (CNDDB 1992). Hiking trails occur 
adjacent to three populations (Terri Thomas, pers. comm., 1993). 

All Presidio populations of 

Lessingia germanorum

 are subject to 
occasional unauthorized vehicle use. This disturbance directly 
destroys the plants and encourages establishment of invasive alien 
vegetation. Weedy species tend to colonize the tracks left by the 
vehicles (Susan Smith, pers. comm., 1992). An environmental 
education camp exists near the location of one population of 

L. 
germanorum. 

No signs or fences currently protect this site. These 
plants are vulnerable to habitat degradation from trampling due to 
their proximity to the camp. 

When the ownership of the Presidio is transferred from the 
Department of the Army to the National Park Service, a marked 
increase in visitation by the public is expected (Terri Thomas, pers. 
comm., 1992, 1993). Increased foot traffic and other recreational 
activities are likely to negatively impact 

Lessingia germanorum

 
because the populations are close to trails. In addition, the park 
is patrolled by police on horseback. Horses can trample the plants 
directly and compact the soil. The potential is high for populations 
of 

L. germanorum 

on the Presidio to be adversely impacted by these 
activities. 

Garbage dumping has degraded the habitat at one site on the 
Presidio where 

Lessingia germanorum

 occurs (CNDDB 1992). Digging by 
pets also adversely affects 

L. germanorum

 at all sites on the 
Presidio by destroying individual plants (Laura Nelson, Golden Gate 
National Recreation Area, pers. comm., 1993; Peter Lacivita, San 
Francisco Corps of Engineers, pers comm., 1993). 

On San Bruno Mountain, fertilizer run-off from a housing 
development above the slope supporting the largest population of 


Lessingia germanorum 

(Paul Reeberg, pers. comm., 1993) threatens this 
site. The nitrogen in these fertilizers promotes invasion by weed 
species that compete with 

L. germanorum

.

Change in fire frequency threatens 

Arctostaphylos imbricata.

 
Fire suppression policies have altered natural processes occurring on 
San Bruno Mountain. If a fire were to break out on San Bruno 
Mountain, attempts would be made by the County to extinguish the fire 
(Doug Heisinger, San Mateo County Park Department, pers. comm., 
1993), to protect the surrounding homes and commercial buildings. 

A. 
imbricata

 is a fire-adapted plant that regenerates from seed rather 
than resprouting from a basal burl. After a fire, seeds that have 
accumulated in the soil (i.e. seed bank) sprout, which reestablishes 
the population. Between fires 

A. imbricata

 spreads vegetatively. 
Reproduction by seed is important to maintain the genetic diversity 
within the species. No significant seedling establishment occurs 
until fire eliminates competing vegetation, as with a recent fire at 
Kamchatka Point that killed the mature plants yet subsequently 
induced regeneration from seed (Roman Gankin, pers. comm., 1993). 
Fire replenishes soil nutrients and facilitates seed germination and 
seedling reestablishment by eliminating competition and shading. If 
the time between fires is too long, 

A. imbricata

 has little 
opportunity to reproduce sexually and individuals may become 
senescent. Conversely, fire occurring too frequently also poses a 
threat. If consecutive fires occurred within a short period (5 
years), a non-sprouting species could be eliminated (Paul Zedler, San 
Diego State University, pers. comm., 1993; Michael Vasey, San 
Francisco State University, pers. comm., 1993). The plants either 
would not reach flowering age or not retain enough seed in the soil 
during the interval between fires to ensure the persistence of the 
species. 

As discussed in Factor A, habitat fragmentation may adversely 
alter the physical environment. In addition, habitat fragmentation 
increases the risks of extinction by leaving the species vulnerable 
to chance events such as pest or disease outbreaks, reproductive 
failure (which can be devastating to annual plants), or other natural 
or human-caused disasters. The small isolated nature of the 
remaining populations and restricted distribution of both 

Lessingia 
germanorum

 and 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 make extinction due to 
stochastic events more likely. A local catastrophe, such as a flood, 
disease outbreak, extended drought, landslide, or combination of 
several such events, could destroy part of a single population or 
entire populations. A local catastrophe also could decrease a 
population to so few individuals that the risk of extirpation due to 
genetic problems associated with small populations would increase. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and 
future threats faced by these species in determining to propose this 
rule. 

Lessingia germanorum

 has been reduced to five small 
populations on the Presidio in San Francisco County and one site on 
San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County; collectively, the populations 
inhabit less than 0.8 hectares (2 acres). This taxon has been 
adversely affected and is endangered by competition with invasive 
alien vegetation, sand quarrying, increased traffic and recreational 
activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, shading by alien and 
native vegetation, incidental use of fertilizers, bulldozing, 
residential and commercial development, other anthropogenic 
activities, and stochastic events. 

Lessingia germanorum

 is in danger 
of extinction throughout all or a significant part of its range, and 
the preferred action is, therefore, to list it as endangered. 


Arctostaphylos imbricata

 has always been rare, and is restricted to 
five small populations on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County. 
This species is vulnerable to alterations of the natural fire regime 
and stochastic events. Because the threats facing 

Arctostaphylos 
imbricata

 are long-term rather than imminent, the species is not now 
in immediate danger of extinction throughout all or a significant 
portion of its range. However, with continued alteration of the 
natural fire cycle, the plant is likely to become endangered within 
the foreseeable future. As a result, the preferred action is to list 


A. imbricata

 as threatened. 



Critical Habitat 



Critical habitat, as defined by section 3 of the Act and 50 CFR 
424.02 (d) is: (i) the specific areas within the geographical area 
occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with 
the Act, on which are found those physical or biological features (I) 
essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may 
require special management considerations or protection and; (ii) 
specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at 
the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas are 
essential for the conservation of the species. Designations of 
critical habitat must be based on the best scientific data available 
and must take into consideration the economic and other relevant 
impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat at the 
time the species is listed as endangered or threatened.

<TEXT>
 

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent 
prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat 
concurrently with determining a species to be endangered or 
threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat 
is not prudent for 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 and 

Lessingia germanorum,

 
at this time. Because 

A. imbricata

 and 

L. germanorum

 face the threat 
of collection, the publication of precise maps and descriptions of 
critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

 would make these plants more 
vulnerable to incidents of collection and, therefore, could 
contribute to the decline of this species and increase enforcement 
problems. The listing of 

A. imbricata

 and 

L. germanorum

 also 
publicizes their rarity and, thus, can make these plants attractive 
to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. A. 


imbricata

 occurs at very few locations entirely on San Bruno 
Mountain. Any activity that would adversely modify critical habitat 
would likely jeopardize the continued existence of the species as 
well. The designation of critical habitat therefore would not 
provide additional benefit for this species beyond the protection 
afforded by listing. Designation of critical habitat therefore would 
not be prudent for 

A. imbricata

 or 

L. germanorum.

 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered 
or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, 
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain 
activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in 
conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, 
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and 
cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions be 
carried out for all listed species. The protection required of 
Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities 
involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate 
their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed 
as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, 
if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR 
Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to 
confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in 
destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If 
a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, 
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation 
with the Service. 

Five populations of 

Lessingia germanorum

 occur on Federal land 
managed by the Department of Defense. 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

 
occurs within the San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan area. 

Listing these two plants would provide for development of a 
recovery plan(s) for them. Such plan(s) would bring together both 
State and Federal efforts for conservation of the plants. The 
plan(s) would establish a framework for agencies to coordinate 
activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts.

The plans would set recovery priorities and estimate costs of various 
tasks necessary to accomplish them. They also would describe 
site-specific management actions necessary to achieve conservation 
and survival of the two plants. Additionally, pursuant to section 6 
of the Act, the Service would be able to grant funds to affected 
States for management actions promoting the protection and recovery 
of these species. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 
17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plants and 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72 for 
threatened plants set forth a series of general prohibitions and 
exceptions. With respect to 

Lessingia germanorum,

 proposed to be 
listed as endangered, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of 
the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These 
prohibitions, in part, make it illegal with respect to any endangered 
plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
to import or export; transport in interstate or foreign commerce in 
the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale this 
species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to 
possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; 
maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under 
Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any 
such endangered plant species on any other area in knowing violation 
of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a 
State criminal trespass law. 



Arctostaphylos imbricata,

 proposed to be listed as threatened, 
would be subject to similar prohibitions (16 U.S.C. 1538(a)(2)(E); 50 
CFR 17.61, 17.71). Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened 
plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a 
statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. 
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State 
conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 
also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise 
prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened plant 
species under certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few 
trade permits would ever be sought or issued for the two species 
because the plants are not common in cultivation or in the wild. 
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries 
regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Ecological Services, Permits Branch, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, 
Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-6241) (FAX:503/231-6243). 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. 
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned 
governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any 
other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby 
solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning:

 or 

Arctostaphylos imbricata

; and 
(9) the methodology the Service might use, under section 
4(b)(2) of the Act, in determining if the benefits of excluding an 
area from critical habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the 
area as critical habitat; 
Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration 
the comments and any additional information received by the Service, 
and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs 
from this proposal. 
The Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if 
requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of 
publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing 
and addressed to the Field Supervisor of the Sacramento Field Office 
(see 

ADDRESSES

 section). 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an 
Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in 
connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the 
Act. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination 
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 
49244).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of petition finding and status review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the 90-day finding that a petition to add the Australian koala to the List
of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife has presented substantial information indicating that the action may be warranted.
A status review of this species is initiated.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 4(b)(3) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, requires that within 90 days of receipt of a petition
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to revise a critical habitat designation, a finding be made on whether
the petition has presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted, and that
such finding be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

 



If the finding is positive, Section 4(b)(3) also requires commencement of a review of the status of the involved species.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) now announces a 90-day finding on a recently received petition.

The petition was submitted by Australians for Animals (in Australia) and the Fund for Animals (in the United States);
about 40 additional organizations in the United States and Australia were named as supporting the petition. It was
dated May 3, 1994, and was received by the Service on May 5, 1994. It requests that the koala 

(Phascolarctos cinereus),

 a bearlike Australian marsupial, be classified as endangered in New South Wales and Victoria, and as threatened in
Queensland.

The koala once occurred over much of the three indicated states, as well as in part of South Australia, and numbered
in the millions. The petition presents an extensive compilation of data, including recent direct testimony from
authorities on the species, suggesting that the koala has declined greatly in distribution and numbers, and that
its status is likely to continue to deteriorate. Reportedly, there are practically none left in South Australia and
only a few thousand in New South Wales and Victoria; the Queensland population may be less than 10 percent of what it
was in the 1920s.

The species was drastically reduced by excessive killing for its fur up through the 1920s. It subsequently was provided
legal protection from such killing, but, according to the petition, remnant populations are relatively small and
badly fragmented. Logging, agriculture, and other problems have eliminated at least two-thirds of the original
forest and woodland habitat, further declines are occurring, and little of the remaining habitat is well protected.
The species is totally dependent for food and shelter on certain types of trees within forests and woodlands. The destruction
or degradation of this habitat will reduce the viability of populations, even if the animals are otherwise protected,
and many local populations are said to have disappeared in recent years. Other reported problems include fires, diseases,
droughts, harassment by dogs, interference with normal gene flow, and killing along the roads now penetrating habitat.
The largest population remaining in Queensland is now said to be immediately threatened by a major highway project
that would bisect its habitat.

The Service is aware that the koala is generally protected by federal and procincial laws in Australia, and that there
have been intensive government efforts to conserve and reintroduce some populations. However, the information
presented by the petition gives cause for concern about the over-all prospects for the species and its natural ecosystems,
and suggests that further review of the situation is advisable. The Service therefore has found that the petition
presents substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Also, pursuant to Section
4(b)(3), the Service hereby commences a review of the status of the involved species. Submission of appropriate data,
opinions, and publications regarding this petition is encouraged. In accordance with Section 4(b)(3), within 12
months of receipt of the petition, the Service will make another finding as to whether the requested action is warranted,
not warranted, or warranted but precluded by other listing measures.



Authority



The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

).

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administration for Children and Families is proposing to amend existing regulations pertaining to child and
family services to implement a new services program, ``Family Preservation and Support Services,'' subpart 2 of
title IV-B of the Social Security Act. 



This new subpart aims to promote family strength and stability, enhance parental functioning, and protect children
through funding a capped entitlement for States and eligible Indian tribes to develop, establish, expand, and operate
family preservation services and community-based family support services, which the law defines broadly. 
To receive funding in FY 1995, States and eligible Indian tribes are required to submit a five-year plan, which must
be developed jointly by the State or Indian tribe and ACF after broad consultation with appropriate public and nonprofit
private agencies and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs of services for
children and families, including family support and preservation services. The plan may be submitted at any time
after completion of the planning processes but no later than June 30, 1995. 
In order to reduce administrative burden and emphasize the potential for a more comprehensive effective child and
family services system, the regulations propose to consolidate this plan with similar plan requirements under title
IV-B, subpart 1, ``Child Welfare Services.'' In addition, we propose to require that the plan include information
on three closely related child and family services programs: the Independent Living Program under Section 477 of
the Social Security Act; and two State formula grants under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act: Part I, Basic
State grants and Part II, Medical Neglect/Disabled Infants State grants.

I. Introduction 



A. Overview 



While many public, private, and nonprofit entities provide a wide range of services to families in need, the primary
governmental responsibility for child and family services rests with the States. Each State has its own legal and
administrative structures and programs that address the needs of children and families. 

The Federal government assists States, and, under some programs, Indian tribes, to provide services to children
and families through a variety of block grants; formula grants; discretionary grants; and national efforts in the
areas of research, evaluation, technical assistance, and data collection.

Title IV-B of the Social Security Act has been a part of the Act since its inception in 1935. Historically, title
IV-B has provided Federal formula grants to States to establish, extend, and strengthen child welfare services.
Services are available to all children including the disabled, homeless, neglected, and dependent. Title IV-B
grants to Indian tribes were first awarded in FY 1983. 

Closely related programs include title IV-E of the Social Security Act (an open-ended entitlement program
providing funds to States for foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments and a formula grant program
providing funds for independent living services for youth); title XX of the Social Security Act (the social services
block grant which States use to fund a wide range of social services); State formula grants to assist States to provide
child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention, and treatment services; the Head Start program; and in recent
years, a number of discretionary grant programs, e.g., Abandoned Infants, Temporary Child Care and Crisis Nurseries,
the Comprehensive Child Development Program, and the Family Resource and Support program. 



B. Enactment of New Legislation: Family Preservation and Support Services 



In August, 1993, under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, Congress amended title
IV-B to change the name of the title from ``Child Welfare Services'' to ``Child and Family Services;'' create
a new subpart 1 entitled ``Child Welfare Services'' from existing statutory language; and add a new subpart 2, ``Family
Preservation and Support Services.'' (42 U.S.C. 630-635)

The FY 1994 appropriation for this new legislation (subpart 2) is $60 million. Of this amount, $2 million is reserved
for Federal evaluation, research, and training and technical assistance; $600,000 is reserved for grants to Indian
tribes. The balance is available for grants to States to fund planning and services for family support and family preservation.

For FY 1995, the authorization increases to $150 million. Of this amount, $6 million is reserved for Federal evaluation,
research, and training and technical assistance; $1.5 million is reserved for grants to Indian tribes. A new program
of grants to State courts will be initiated at a funding level of $5 million. The balance is available for grants to States
for family preservation and family support services. 


C. Previous Legislation: Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-272) 


Enactment of a new subpart 2 to title IV-B of the Social Security Act is the first major change in this title since
the amendments made by Pub. L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. 
The goals of that legislation were to: 
 Prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families; 
 Improve the quality of care and services to children and their families; and 

 Ensure permanency for children through reunification with parents, through adoption, or through another
permanent living arrangement. 
These goals have not been fully realized. A wide variety of reasons have been suggested by researchers and practitioners,
including: 
 Social, cultural, and economic changes (increases in substance abuse, community violence, restructuring
of the economy, poverty, and homelessness, for example), which have affected the number of families coming to the
attention of child welfare agencies and the severity of their problems; 

 Rising rates of child abuse and neglect reports, particularly for child sexual abuse; 
 A child welfare system unable to keep up with these increased demands, given constrained resources, high caseloads,
and overburdened workers; 
 Services planning that focuses most resources on crisis intervention (e.g., investigation and placement)
and too few on prevention and treatment; 
 Lack or shortage of services that fit the real needs of families and often are available only when families are
in crisis; and 
 The isolation of the child welfare services system from other services needed by vulnerable families, such
as housing, employment, and substance abuse services. 
Acknowledging that the system was not working for our most vulnerable children and their families, Congress amended
title IV-B to provide States and eligible Indian tribes with new Federal dollars for preventive services (family
support services) and services to families at risk or in crisis (family preservation services). 
This legislation provides a new opportunity for States and local communities and eligible Indian tribes to review
their current strategies for meeting the service needs of children and their families, identify service gaps and
barriers to coordination of services, and develop and carry out a comprehensive five-year plan for providing a continuum
of services to families and their children. 


D. Family Preservation and Family Support: Services and Principles 



As one part of our implementation plan, ACF convened a series of focus groups on family preservation and family support
services in the fall of 1993. Both the discussion at the focus groups and the literature on professional practice reflected
general agreement on the goals for family support and family preservation services. These services should be directed
towards: 
 Assuring the safety of all family members; 
 Enhancing parents' ability to create safe, stable, and nurturing home environments that promote healthy
child development;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00072 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Assisting children and families to resolve crises, connect with necessary and appropriate services, and

remain safely together in their homes whenever possible; and 
 Avoiding unnecessary out-of-home placement of children, and helping children already in out-of-home care
to be returned to and be maintained with their families or in another planned, permanent living arrangement. 


Family support services

 are primarily community-based preventive activities designed to alleviate stress and promote parental competencies
and behaviors that will increase the ability of families to successfully nurture their children; enable families
to use other resources and opportunities available in the community; and create supportive networks to enhance child-rearing
abilities of parents and help compensate for the increased social isolation and vulnerability of families. 
Examples of community-based family support services and activities include: 
 Respite care for parents and other caregivers; 
 Early developmental screening of children to assess the needs of these children and assistance in obtaining
specific services to meet their needs; 
 Mentoring, tutoring, and health education for youth; and 
 A range of center-based activities (informal interactions in drop-in centers, parent support groups) and
home visiting activities. 


Family preservation services

 typically are services designed to help families alleviate crises that might lead to out-of-home placement of children;
maintain the safety of children (and other family members) in their own homes; support families preparing to reunite
or adopt; and assist families in obtaining services and other supports necessary to address their needs in a culturally
sensitive manner. (If a child cannot be protected from harm without placement, family preservation services are
not appropriate). 
Examples of family preservation activities and services include: 
 Intensive preplacement preventive services; 
 Respite care for parents and other caregivers (including foster parents); 
 Services to improve parenting skills and support child development; 
 Follow-up services to support adopting and reunifying families; 
 Services for youth and families at risk or in crisis; and 
 Community-based intervention and advocacy services for victims of domestic violence and their dependents.



Guiding Principles 


Both family support and family preservation services are based on a common set of principles or characteristics which
help assure their responsiveness and effectiveness for children and their families. Focus group participants frequently
pointed out that, while various models of services or programs are available, it is an approach based on these principles
that should provide an organizing framework for planning for these new services. 
The principles emphasize safety for all family members; a family-focused approach while allowing for individual
needs; and a service delivery approach that stresses flexibility, accessibility, coordination, and respect for
cultural and community strengths. (See 45 CFR 1355.25) 


E. Development of Family Support and Family Preservation Services 


Family support and family preservation services are not new. They date back to the turn of the century, e.g., Hull House
and the settlement house movement. Recently, however, there has been increased interest in such programs. 
Over the last several years, State and local governments, foundations, national organizations, nonprofit agencies,
and professional organizations have begun to develop and implement family support and family preservation programs;
push for change in child welfare programs, including reform of State laws and policies to support ``family-centered
practice;'' and experiment with changing the way child welfare services are organized and delivered, including
strengthening linkages with other agencies and resources and moving toward greater community direction and control
of services.

<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A few examples of such efforts include the American Public Welfare Association's policy on 

Commitment to Change, 

the ``decategorization of funding'' and collaborative planning efforts in a number of States, the Children's Trust
Funds and Children's Cabinets, and support for demonstrations of improved planning and child welfare service delivery
from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and the Kellogg Foundation. 

Today, there are a variety of models of family preservation providing services to families at risk or in crisis. These
models differ in level of intensity, services approaches, duration of services, and entrance parameters. Specific
program models include Homebuilders, the Families First programs, Family Services America programs, and Maryland's
Intensive Family Services program. 

Also, today, there are hundreds of community-based family support programs nationwide including center-based
models (family resource centers); school-based models; home-based models, including home visiting programs;
and models that combine several approaches, such as Parents and Teachers, the Home Instruction Program for Preschool
Youngsters (HIPPY), and the Healthy Families America initiative. The Family Services America programs are considered
both family preservation and family support. 

Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations also have developed and implemented family-centered or family-based
services, including family preservation and family support programs. Tribal programs may be center-based, home-based
(include home visiting), or contain elements of both. Most programs seek to build on family strengths and use traditional
and cultural activities as a part of their services approach. 

Several Federal programs or initiatives also have focused on prevention, family-centered practice, and a community-based
approach. Some examples include: 

 The Head Start Bureau's Family Services and Family Support Projects, and Parent and Child Centers; 

 The National Comprehensive Child Development Program demonstration; 

 The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's State community-based prevention grants associated with
Children's Trust Funds; 

 The National Family Support Resource Center and the National Family-Based Services Resource Center (beginning
in 1994, it will be known as the National Family-Centered Practice Resource Center) funded by the Children's Bureau;


 The Family and Youth Services Bureau's Family Resource and Support program; 

 The Public Health Services' (PHS) ``Healthy Start'' program; 

 The Office of Community Services' Family Support Centers (homeless families demonstration); 

 The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Family Self-Sufficiency demonstration program;
and 

 The PHS Child and Adolescent Services System Program (CASSP), a planning model for coordinated mental health
services for children now implemented in all States. 



F. ACF Implementation of the Family Preservation and Support Services Legislation: Lessons Learned From the Field




The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) recognized that for the new program to be effective, we needed
to engage in a variety of learning activities that would support the development of useful guidance and appropriate
Federal regulations. 

As one part of our implementation of this new legislation, we convened a series of focus groups in both the Central and
Regional Offices with family support and family preservation program directors, practitioners, and experts; State,
county, and city child welfare administrators; State and local agencies with experience in providing such services;
representatives of Indian tribes and regional and national Tribal organizations; national advocacy, interest
group, and professional organizations; representatives of national organizations representing Governors, State
legislators, and counties; and parents, foster parents, and consumers of child welfare services. In addition, we
met with or received written materials and recommendations from a number of other experts and practitioners in the
field. 
The suggestions, guidance, and information we received through this process have been invaluable to us in the development
of the Program Instructions to States and Indian tribes on applying for FY 1994 funds (ACYF-PI-94-01,
January 18, 1994, and ACYF PI-94-04, January 18, 1994) and this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM):


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 First, both the Program Instructions (PIs) and this NPRM follow the statutory requirements closely. In the
NPRM, we have sought to avoid detailed prescriptions or requirements for specific models of services in order to allow
States, Indian tribes, and local communities significant flexibility. Instead, we have identified principles
of effective family support and preservation services that should guide grantees and others in conducting their
planning process and designing specific services programs that meet the needs of children and families. 

 Second, both the PIs and this NPRM focus on the statutory requirement for a five-year plan; they emphasize,
for States and Indian tribes as appropriate, the opportunity provided by the law in making available 100 percent Federal
funding for planning activities leading to the development of the five-year plan. In particular, they stress the
value of a thoughtful, strategic planning process that includes broad consultation and involvement of State and
local public agencies, nonprofit private agencies, parents and other consumers, representatives of professional
and advocacy organizations, and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs for
children and families (including family support and family preservation). 

 Third, while focusing on the development and expansion of services, the PIs and this NPRM highlight the opportunity
provided by the statutory requirement for broad consultation and coordination of services. In particular, we urge
States and Indian tribes to use this new legislation, the new planning requirements, and the 100 percent funding as
a catalyst for establishing a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-focused services
for children and families regardless of funding streams. Thus, the NPRM requires consultation and coordination
both within the child and family services system and among the other service delivery systems providing social, economic,
and health-related support to children and their families. 

 Fourth, we recognized that we could not expect coordination and collaboration across service delivery systems
at the State and local level if we did not take steps toward improved coordination at the Federal level. We have been
working with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), the Center for Mental Health Services, the Health Resources
and Services Administration, the Department of Justice, and other agencies to explore and act on collaboration opportunities.
An early example of this effort to support children and family services is the discretionary announcement by the MCHB
to support the State's first year family preservation and support planning process. Another example is the joint
funding of a training and technical assistance center that will focus on services integration among child welfare,
maternal and child health, and mental health services delivery systems. 

 Finally, recommendations from the field influenced the development of our evaluation and training and technical
assistance plans which are both aimed at supporting and strengthening effective service delivery for children and
family services. 



G. Vision for Family Preservation and Family Support Services 



In passing the family preservation and support legislation, Congress recognized that new funding alone would not
be sufficient to meet the goals of the legislation and Pub. L. 96-272. New or expanded services are just one element
needed to improve the child and family service system. In order to ensure that services are part of a comprehensive,
coordinated service delivery system that draws heavily on community-based programs in its design and implementation,
States, Indian tribes, and communities are encouraged to use these new resources strategically to carry out major
changes in the ways services are delivered and in the systems that deliver them. 

Based on the collective views of parents, practitioners, advocates, researchers, and others who shared with ACF
their concerns and hopes for strengthening the American family, the vision States, communities, and Indian tribes
are encouraged to develop is of a child and family service system that: 

 Keeps children and family members safe at all times; 

 Builds on the resources and strengths of families; 

 Offers a continuum of services to children and families that is family-focused, easily accessible, and respectful
of cultural and community characteristics; and 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Links the child and family continuum of services to other community child and family services and service delivery
systems (e.g., mental health, education, housing, substance abuse) and the courts, to ensure that families have
access to comprehensive services to meet their individual needs. 

That is, in addition to providing funds for expanding services, this new program offers States and eligible Indian
tribes an extraordinary opportunity to assess and make changes in service delivery to children and families. The
purpose of these changes is to assure safety and achieve improved well-being for vulnerable children and their families,
particularly those experiencing, or at risk for, abuse and neglect. Because the multiple needs of these vulnerable
children and families cannot be addressed adequately through categorical programs and fragmented service delivery
systems, we encourage States and Indian tribes to use the planning process under the new program to help establish
a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-focused services for children and families.


Among the elements that would ideally be part of the child and family services continuum, depending on family needs,
are family support and family preservation services; child welfare services, including child abuse and neglect
prevention, intervention, and treatment services, and foster care; and services to support reunification, adoption,
kinship care, independent living, or other permanent living arrangements. Linkages to other services and service
systems such as health, mental health, housing, employment, education, and child care, complete the picture of a
responsive service delivery system. 

Therefore, we expect that a major goal of the planning process States and Indian tribes will undertake in 
FY 1994-95 will be to examine the changes that are needed to make delivery of services more responsive to the needs
of individuals and communities and more sensitive to the context in which they are to be delivered. 



II. Section by Section Discussion of the NPRM 



A. Highlights of the NPRM 



1. Approach to Writing This NPRM 



In implementing this new legislation, our primary aim has been to follow closely the statutory requirements as mandated
by Congress. Our approach reflects not only the recommendations we received based on a broad consultation process
with many outside agencies, but also our commitment to flexibility; reducing administrative burden; and supporting
State and Indian tribal efforts to improve the health, development, and well-being of children, youth, and families.


Overall, we have emphasized the importance of a serious planning process and the development of a five-year plan that
is a dynamic, operational document. The NPRM proposes considerable flexibility but also contains specific minimum
requirements in several areas which we believe will assist States and Indian tribes to strengthen and expand services
and improve service delivery. 



2. Principles of Child and Family Services 



As guidance to States and Indian tribes, we have included principles of services most often identified by practitioners
and others as helping to assure effective services for children, youth and families. (See  1355.25)

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Comprehensive Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) 



We propose to consolidate into one five-year plan (rather than two plans, one of which currently is due on a one, two,
or three-year cycle) all requirements applicable to the two service programs under title IV-B. These two programs
are administered by the same agency, generally serve the same 

populations, contain similar (in some instances identical) planning requirements, and are a part of the child and
family services continuum. (See  1357.15) 



4. Description of Other Services Included in the CFSP 



Because services under the Independent Living Program and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act are also a
part of the child and family services continuum, we propose that the CFSP describe the services provided under these
funding sources and that the State explain how these funds are coordinated with and integrated into the services continuum.
(See  1357.15 (a), (n) and (o)) 



5. Joint Planning and Approval of the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report 



We have proposed an ongoing joint planning partnership to implement the statutory requirement that the CFSP may not
be approved unless it was jointly developed by ACF and the State (or the Indian tribe). Both the CFSP and the Annual Progress
and Services Report must be jointly developed and approved in order for a grantee to receive funding. (See  1357.10(c)
and  1357.15(b)) 



6. Content of the CFSP 



In designing their family preservation and family support services programs, States and Indian tribes may select
the services to be provided, the target populations, and the geographic areas where services will be provided. We
have not required specific ``core'' services, model service approaches, client eligibility criteria, or methods
for the selection of priority populations or geographic areas. 

In addition to the statutory requirement for goals, measures of progress toward the goals, and annual services reports,
we propose to require that the CFSP include: 

 A vision statement ( 1357.15(g)); 

 Measurable objectives to implement goals ( 1357.15(i)); and 

 Brief descriptions of how family preservation and support services in the CFSP are or will be linked to other
services in the child and family services continuum; how the title IV-B services will help meet the permanency
planning requirements in the Act; how the child and family services continuum is designed to meet the service principles;
and how the services in the continuum will be coordinated with other public services and service systems. (See  1357.15
(o), (p), and (q)) 



7. Planning Processes 



We have proposed flexibility but also included minimum specific requirements to implement the statutory provisions
for consultation and coordination of services. (See  1357.15 (l) and (m)) 

In addition, we have proposed that the State and the Indian tribe, as appropriate, collect existing or available information
as the basis for planning, priority setting, targeting of services, funding decisions, and measuring progress toward
the goals and objectives. (See  1357.15(k)) 



8. Requirements for Indian Tribes 



Taking into account the resources, needs, and circumstances of Indian tribes, we have waived some and modified other
programmatic and fiscal requirements for Indian tribes. (See  1357.15 and  1357.50(f)) 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We have also proposed a procedure for allowing additional Indian tribes to become eligible in FY 1996-1998.
(See  1357.50(d)) 



9. Administrative Costs 



We have proposed what we believe is a definition of administrative costs that will be easy for States to administer.
(See  1357.32(g)) 



10. Technical, Editorial, and Conforming Changes 



Because 45 CFR Parts 1355, 1356, and 1357 have not been amended recently, we are taking advantage of this opportunity
to make technical, editorial, and conforming changes. 

We welcome comments on all aspects of the NPRM, particularly on the scope of the plan and the level of effort and usefulness
of the proposed planning process. 

In the regulatory text, we specify which sections are applicable to States and which are applicable to Indian tribes.
In those sections that apply to both States and Tribes, we use general language such as ``The CFSP must include_'' to
indicate that all grantees must meet this provision. 



B. Section-by-Section Discussion 



We are proposing major amendments in 45 CFR part 1357 and primarily technical and editorial changes in 45 CFR parts
1355 and 1356. 

The most important change is found in 45 CFR 1357.15, comprehensive child and family services plan requirements,
in which we propose a planning process leading to the development of a consolidated five-year plan for the two Federal
child and family services programs under subparts 1 and 2 of title IV-B. 

Our discussion of these proposed amendments will follow in numerical order, beginning with a change in the title of
subchapter G of chapter XIII of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In the title, we propose to delete the term
``child welfare'' and replace it with the term ``child and family services'' to reflect the change in the name of title
IV-B of the Social Security Act made by Pub. L. 103-66. 



1. Part 1355_General 



Section 1355.10 Scope 



This part contains general requirements applicable to both title IV-B and title IV-E of the Social Security
Act. We are proposing to clarify in  1355.10 that the title IV-B requirements also are applicable to Indian
tribes unless otherwise specified. 



Section 1355.20 Definitions 



In  1355.20, we are proposing to make technical changes in four definitions and to add one new definition. The
terms ``ACYF'' and ``Commissioner'' are revised to reflect a change in name and organizational structure which combined
two of the Department's operating divisions (Family Support Administration and Office of Human Development Services)
into the Administration for Children and Families in 1991. 

The term ``State'' is revised to delete an outdated cross-reference to two sections in 45 CFR part 1356 and to clarify
which jurisdictions are eligible for funding under titles IV-B and 
IV-E. 

The term ``State agency'' is revised to reflect the requirement in sections 422 and 471 of the Social Security Act that
the State title IV-B, title IV-E, and title XX (social services block grant) programs must be administered
by the same State agency. An exception to this requirement for States with certain administrative structures in place
on December 1, 1974, is permitted by section 103(d) of Pub. L. 96-272 and is included in the definition. 

Because the Independent Living Program (ILP) is now permanently authorized under section 477 of the Social Security
Act and is a part of the State's child and family services continuum, we have added a definition of the ILP in this section.




Section 1355.21 State Plan Requirements for Titles IV-B and IV-E 



We are proposing a conforming amendment in  1355.21(c) to clarify that the State and the Indian tribe must make
the five-year Child and Family Services Plan and the Annual Progress and Services Reports available for public review
and inspection. The requirement that the State title IV-E plan also be available is a current requirement in
 1355.21(c). 



Section 1355.25 Principles of Child and Family Services



A new  1355.25, Principles of child and family services, is proposed to be added. These general principles are
provided as guidance to States and Indian tribes as they develop and operate child and family services and move towards
a more coordinated service delivery system for children and families. These are the principles most often identified
by practitioners and others as helping to ensure responsive and effective services, particularly for family support
and preservation services. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The principles emphasize the paramount importance of the safety of all members of the family, including victims of
child abuse and neglect and victims of domestic violence and their dependents. ``Family preservation'' does NOT
mean that the family must stay together or ``be preserved'' under all circumstances. 

At the same time, the principles reflect the goal of supporting, preserving, and strengthening families as the best
way to promote the safety, well-being, and the healthy development of children. They emphasize family-focused services
where family strengths are identified, enhanced, respected, and mobilized. 

The service principles also address the needs of individual family members who may need protection or special treatment
and whose ``best interest'' may be temporary care or permanent placement away from the family. They also address the
need for permanency for all children, including services to emancipating youth. 

In addition, the principles provide guidance in bringing about changes in State, local, and Indian tribal child and
family service delivery. They emphasize the importance of accessibility, flexibility, coordination, and building
on community and cultural strengths. A service delivery system organized as a continuum with linkages to other supports
and programs is seen as most effective in serving children and families. 



Accessibility in Relation to the Americans With Disabilities Act 



Related to the principle that services should be accessible is the civil rights requirement under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) for accessibility to services by the disabled. Enacted on July 26, 1990, the ADA provides comprehensive
civil rights protection to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodation, State
and local government services, and telecommunications. The ADA defines public accommodations as facilities whose
operations affect commerce and fall within twelve specified categories, including social service center establishments.
Title II of the ADA governs actions by State and local governments; title III governs actions by public accommodation.


The ADA is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). However, most States have established a central contact,
usually in the Office of the Governor or Attorney General, and questions about the ADA should be referred to that contact
first. In addition, DOJ has established a technical assistance Information Line for public inquiries. The Information
Line is available 24 hours daily at (202) 514-0301 (voice) or (202) 514-0381 (TDD). (This number will be
replaced with a toll free 800 number in the future.) Lastly, written inquiries about the ADA may be directed to: U.S.
Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Public Access Section, P.O. Box 66738, Washington, DC 20035-6738.




Section 1355.30 Other Applicable Regulations 



This section is amended to provide an updated and corrected list of other regulations applicable to titles IV-B
and IV-E. We also have indicated which regulations or which sections of the regulations apply to which titles.
We have added: 

 Part 30 (claims collection); 

 Part 76 (drug free work place requirements); 

 Parts 80, 81, 84, and 91 (implementation of the civil rights statutes); 

 Part 92 (uniform administrative requirements for grants to States); 

 Part 93 (lobbying restrictions); 

 Part 97 (consolidated grants to insular areas); and 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Part 100 (consolidation and simplification of State plans). 

We also propose to delete two regulations. The requirements in  205.101 that identifying and organizational
information must be provided by the administering agency are now incorporated into proposed  1357.15 (e) and
(f); Section 205.150 is proposed to be deleted as the cost allocation plan requirements now are found in 45 CFR part
95. 

We want to call attention to a proposed change in the applicability of 45 CFR part 95, subpart A. Subpart A, Time Limits
for States to File Claims, is based on section 1132 of the Act and now covers title IV-B and the Independent Living
Program (as part of title IV-E). However, the States do not submit claims for the title IV-B programs or
the Independent Living Program (ILP) in accordance with section 1132. Accordingly, we propose to specify that part
95, subpart A, does not apply to these programs. 

The statute for both the ILP and title IV-B, subpart 2, requires that funds be expended (liquidated) within two
years. For these two programs, States (and Indian tribes participating in the subpart 2 program) must file a Standard
Form SF-269 expenditure report 90 days after the end of the two-year expenditure period. Therefore, other time
limits to file claims are not applicable, i.e., subpart A of part 95. 

We have proposed in  1357.30(i) a two year expenditure period for title IV-B, subpart 1 funds. If approved,
this change will have the operational effect of requiring an SF-269 expenditure report for all three programs.



States typically have no difficulty in accounting for their expenditures within the two year period. Therefore,
we see no need to keep title IV-B funds open on an extended basis as currently allowed in subpart A of part 95. We
believe this provision has been burdensome administratively to both Federal and State offices. 



2. Part 1356_Requirements Applicable to Title IV-E 



In  1356.10, we have revised the language to indicate that part 1356 now contains requirements applicable to
the Independent Living Program. 

A new  1356.80, Independent Living Program (ILP), is added to summarize the statutory provisions applicable
to this program. 




3. Part 1357_Requirements Applicable to Title IV-B 



Section 1357.10 Scope and Definitions 



Paragraph (a) of  1357.10 is revised to expand the scope of part 1357 to include the new subpart 2 of title IV-B
(family preservation and support services). 

Paragraph (b) of this section is amended to provide that the services under both subparts 1 and 2 of title IV-B
must be available on the basis of the need for the service and may not be denied on the basis of income or length of residence
in the State or the Indian tribe's jurisdiction. This general eligibility statement does not preclude a State or an
Indian tribe from selecting populations or geographic areas to which family preservation and family support services
will be targeted nor from moving toward Statewideness of child welfare services as required in Section 422 of the Act.


In paragraph (c), we have revised the three definitions currently in paragraph (c) and added five definitions or clarifications
of the following terms: children, community-based services, families, family preservation services, and family
support services. The following three definitions are revised: 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-1-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-1-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. The current definition of ``Child welfare services plan (CWSP)'' is revised to reflect the broader, more comprehensive
scope and content of the proposed ``Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP).'' 

b. The revised definition of ``Child welfare services'' (title IV-B, subpart 1) is taken verbatim from section
425 of the Act. We propose to include this language because we believe that as many public and private agencies and organizations
work together to provide new and more effective services and bring about changes in how services are delivered, a clear
understanding of the purposes to which child welfare services are directed would be helpful. 

c. The current definition of ``Joint planning'' is revised to propose a revitalized partnership process between
ACF and the State and between ACF and the Indian tribe in the development and implementation of child and family services
programs. This process is intended to be characterized by mutual respect and shared responsibility on the part of
all participants. 

Joint planning is required for approval of the five-year Child and Family Services Plan (section 432(b) of the Act)
and is proposed for the development and approval of the Annual Progress and Services Report ( 1357.15(b)(4)).


We view joint planning as a process of discussion, consultation, and negotiation between the parties. It also may
include Federal technical assistance, as needed. Through joint planning, State and Federal staff, and Indian tribes
and Federal staff, with appropriate consultation and participation of other State, local, and community-based
stakeholders, review and discuss key strategic decisions such as: 

 Priorities for services and for target populations; 
 Proposed goals and objectives; 
 Unmet needs, services gaps, and overlaps in funding; 
 Other funding resources available to provide the services needed; 
 The State and local organizations, foundations, and agencies with which the State or Indian tribe can consult
and coordinate services; 
 Ongoing plans to move toward the goals and objectives by improving the service delivery system and ensuring
a more efficient comprehensive system of care for children and families; and 
 Methods for reviewing progress toward the selected goals and objectives. 

Joint planning also includes Federal guidance and technical assistance after the plan has been developed and approved.
This is provided through follow-up review and discussion of progress in accomplishing the goals and objectives identified
in the plan and updating the plan as appropriate. 

The following new definitions and clarifications of terms are proposed: 

a. The term 

children

 refers to individuals from birth to the age of 21, with special emphasis on serving youth, adolescents, and young adults
because too often they are overlooked as child and family services are developed. 

This proposed language is not intended to supersede a State's legal definition of child, children, or age of majority.
Rather, it is intended to emphasize that there are no age restrictions for the purpose of providing services to children
under title IV-B. 

b. The term 

community-based services

 refers to service programs characterized by accessibility and responsiveness to individual, family, and community
needs and which may be provided by public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations including community-based
organizations. The proposed language is intended as guidance to States and Indian tribes in identifying and working
with those local agencies and organizations whose services are most likely to exemplify the principles of child and
family services in 45 CFR 1355.25. 

c. The term 

families

 is proposed to include persons needing services regardless of their family configuration. The language of the new
family support and family preservation legislation explicitly refers to biological, adoptive, foster, and extended
families as recipients of these services. Several agencies, organizations and focus group participants urged that
we use the broadest possible language in this definition, e.g., ``families as defined by themselves.'' Although
we did not include this phrase in the proposed definition, we are in general agreement with its intent. 

d. The proposed definitions of the terms 

family preservation services

 and 

family support services

 are taken from the statute. (Section 431 of the Act) In addition, language from the Conference Report has been added
to provide additional examples of family support services. 

The literature on professional practice and the discussion at the focus groups reflected general agreement on the
goals for family support and family preservation services. These services should be directed towards:

 Enhancing parents' ability to create safe, stable and nurturing home environments that promote healthy child
development; 

 Assisting children and families to resolve crises, connect with necessary and appropriate services, and
remain safely together in their homes; 

 Avoiding unnecessary out-of-home placement of children; and 

 Helping children already in out-of-home care to be returned 
to and be maintained with their families or in another planned, permanent living arrangement. 

Currently, a number of program models, approaches, and levels of family preservation services are in operation.
In this NPRM, the term ``family preservation'' is used to include all such service options. We do not plan to require
and do not endorse any specific program model for implementation. Some activities, such as respite care, home visiting,
and assistance in obtaining 
services, may be considered either a family support or a family preservation service. 



Section 1357.15(a) Scope 



Section 1357.15 contains the requirements we are proposing for the development of the comprehensive five-year Child
and Family Services Plan (CFSP). We solicit comment on the overall requirements of the plan and welcome suggestions
which could result in minimizing the collection and analysis of information and the reporting requirements in the
plan. 

This section consists of twenty-two paragraphs (a) through (v). The paragraphs cover discrete topics such as general
provisions related to scope, eligibility for funds, and required assurances; paragraphs on the specific content
of the comprehensive plan, including a vision statement, goals, and objectives; requirements for the description
of the services to be provided, the populations to be served, and the geographic areas to be targeted; specific proposals
for the planning process leading to the development of the plan; and other provisions focused on the continuum of services,
permanency planning efforts, and other statutory requirements. 

Paragraph (a)(1) of this section specifies the overall scope of the plan by proposing the consolidation into one comprehensive
five-year plan of both the family preservation and family support services and the child welfare services programs
under title IV-B of the Social Security Act. 

Paragraph (a)(2) proposes that the plan must include information on the Independent Living Program (ILP) and two
formula grant programs under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA).

Paragraph (a)(3) clarifies that some requirements in  1357 apply only to States, some apply only to Indian tribes,
and some apply to both as specified. 

Overall, paragraph (a) is based on section 432 of the Act (subpart 2) which requires States and eligible Indian tribes
to submit a five-year plan for family preservation and family support services. It is also based on section 422 of the
Act (subpart 1) which requires a State plan for child welfare services. 

We elected to consolidate the planning and reporting requirements for the two title IV-B programs for several
reasons. Child welfare services and family preservation and family support services are both a part of the child and
family services continuum; both programs are administered by the same agency and address common problems of the same
population of children and families. In addition, focus group participants urged us to consolidate planning, application
requirements, and program reporting, where possible. 

Currently under subpart 1, States and Indian tribes may submit their child welfare services plan at one, two, or three
year intervals. Combining the planning and reporting requirements for subparts 1 and 2 will reduce the number of plans
and, consequently, the administrative burden. More importantly, one comprehensive plan will assist both States
and Indian tribes to plan for and make more effective use of resources and develop a more integrated, coordinated,
and family-focused service system. 

We considered requiring States to consolidate three additional programs in the CFSP_the Independent Living Program
(ILP) under title IV-E, section 477; and the two child abuse and neglect formula grant programs under the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA): Part I (Basic State grants) and Part II (Medical Neglect/Disabled Infants
State grants) (sections 107(a) and 107(g) of CAPTA). 

However, although the ILP and the CAPTA programs are both a part of the State's child and family services continuum,
and their inclusion in the CFSP would reinforce and strengthen the comprehensiveness and usefulness of the CFSP,
the current statutory and administrative requirements in these three programs are barriers to consolidation at
this point. We may propose the inclusion of additional programs in the CFSP at a future date. 

Instead, paragraph (a)(2) proposes to require that the State's CFSP must contain the same descriptive services information
on the ILP and the two CAPTA formula grant programs as on other child and family services. (See 45 CFR 1357.15(n)) We
believe that the inclusion of this information will facilitate ongoing coordination, consultation, and joint planning
efforts among these programs and assist States to move toward a more comprehensive service delivery system. In addition,
representatives of the ILP and CAPTA programs will be involved in the development and implementation of the CFSP,
e.g., the consultation, and other processes leading to the development of goals and objectives and the required description
of services in the plan. (See paragraph (l) of this section.) 

Although there are barriers to requiring the ILP in the plan, there is nothing to prohibit a State from including in
the CFSP the information needed to receive annual ILP funding. Section 477 of the Act requires that the annual ILP application
be submitted prior to February 1. As long as this date is met, States may submit the required program and fiscal information
and assurances either in the CFSP or by the statutory due date. For example, States could submit information for the
FY 1996 ILP application either as a part of the FY 1995 CFSP (due June 30, 1995) or by January 31, 1996. If a State elects
to consolidate the ILP application information into the CFSP, funding for the independent living program will not
be withheld in the event that a State's CFSP is not approved for reasons unrelated to the ILP program. 

States and Indian tribes may, and are encouraged to, include additional child and family services programs in the
CFSP, at their option. (See 45 CFR 100.12.) 



Section 1357.15(b) Eligibility for Funds 



Paragraph (b) specifies the eligibility requirements for receipt of funds under title IV-B, subparts 1 and
2. 

Paragraph (b)(1) requires that, in order to receive FY 1995 title IV-B funding, States and Indian tribes must
submit for approval a five-year Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). In order to receive funding in subsequent years,
States and Indian tribes must submit for approval an Annual Progress and Services Report that meets the statutory
and regulatory requirements of title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2. 

Assuming that Congress appropriates the necessary funds, FY 1995 funds will be available when the CFSP has been submitted
and is approved; FY 1996 funds will be available in FY 1996 based on the projected FY 1996 services information included
in the CFSP. FY 1997 funds will be available in FY 1997 based on the Annual Progress and Services Report due to ACF June
30, 1996.

Paragraph (b)(2) states the requirements in section 432 (a) and (b) of the Act that a plan will be approved only if it
was developed through a process of joint planning between ACF and the State (or the Indian tribe), and only after broad
consultation by the State (and the Indian tribe as indicated) with appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies
and community-based 
organizations with experience in administering programs of services for children, youth and families. 

Paragraph (b)(3) proposes to require that the Annual Progress and Services Report will be approved only if it was developed
through a process of joint planning between ACF and the State (or the Indian tribe) and if it meets the requirements
of  1357.16 of this Part. 

Paragraph (b)(4) proposes to give the State and the Indian tribe the option of submitting the FY 1995-1999 CFSP
and the FY 1996 Annual Progress and Services Report in the format of its choice, but requires that these two documents
be submitted to the appropriate ACF Regional Office no later than June 30, 1995. 



Section 1357.15(c) Assurances 



We are proposing in  1357.15(c) that the CFSP must contain the assurances applicable to both title IV-B
programs. 

Once signed by the appropriate official, the assurances will remain in effect on an ongoing basis (not just during
the five-year plan) and will need to be re-submitted only if significant changes in the State's or the Indian tribe's
program affects an assurance. 

In the interest of clarity and convenience for grantees, ACYF will develop a compilation of all assurances for the
two title IV-B programs. 



Section 1357.15(d) The Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP): General 



Section 1357.15(d) proposes that the CFSP must be developed based on three important planning activities, two of
which are found in both subparts of title IV-B (sections 422 and 432 of the Act). Subsequent paragraphs of this
section contain specific requirements for these activities. The two statutory requirements are: 

 Broad involvement and consultation with a wide range of appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies
and community-based organizations, parents, and others (see also  1357.15(l)); and 

 Coordination of the provision of services with other Federal and federally assisted programs serving children
and families, including youth and adolescents (see also  1357.15(m)). 

In addition, we propose to add, as a necessary basis for planning and developing the CFSP, the collection of baseline
information (see also  1357.15 (k)). We are not proposing the collection of extensive new data by States or Indian
tribes, but are emphasizing the use of existing and available data supplemented, if needed, by specific studies.
We believe such information will help States and Indian tribes determine those programmatic and/or geographic areas
where the well-being of children and families is threatened; assess needs and existing services and resources; identify
gaps in services; select priorities for services funding; assist in the selection of goals and objectives; and develop
opportunities for bringing about more effective and accessible services for children, youth, and families. 

Child welfare information systems which States currently are designing and implementing based on recently authorized
enhanced funding will be one source of valuable information during the implementation of the CFSP.

Section 1357.15(e) State Agency Administering the Programs 


We are proposing in  1357.15(e) that the CFSP identify the name of the State agency that will administer the title
IV-B programs under the plan. Except as provided by statute, the same agency must administer or supervise the
administration of the programs under titles IV-B, IV-E, and XX of the Act. (See definition of State agency
in 45 CFR 1355.20.) 
We are further proposing in paragraph (e) that the CFSP include a description of the organization and function of the
State agency and organizational charts as appropriate. It also must identify the organizational unit(s) within
the State agency responsible for the operation and administration of the CFSP, and include a description of the unit's
organization and function and a copy of the organizational chart(s). This information is currently required by 45
CFR 205.101 (see also 45 CFR 1355.30). We are proposing to include the required information here and delete the cross-reference
in 45 CFR 1355.30. 


Section 1357.15(f) Indian Tribal Organization Administering the Program(s) 


We are proposing in  1357.15 (f) that the Indian tribe's CFSP must provide the name of the Indian tribal organization
(ITO) designated to administer funds under title IV-B, subpart 1, child welfare services and/or under title
IV-B, subpart 2, family preservation and family support services. If the Indian tribe receives funds under
both subparts, the same agency or organization must administer both programs. 
Section 1357.15(f) also proposes that the CFSP of the Indian tribe must include a description of the organization
and function of the office responsible for the operation and administration of the CFSP, an organizational chart
of that office, and a description of how that office relates to tribal and other offices operating or administering
services programs within the Indian tribe's service area, e.g., Indian Health Service. 


Section 1357.15(g) Vision Statement 


The new focus on family-based services and community linkages requires changes in vision, philosophy, and in the
design and delivery of child and family services. In order for States and Indian tribes to develop a realistic yet forward
looking CFSP, we believe that they must first set forth their vision in providing services to children and their families.

The Program Instructions encouraged States and Indian tribes to use up to $1 million of the 100 percent Federal FY 1994
funds and the planning period to help articulate that vision. Paragraph (g) proposes that the CFSP must include the
vision statement as developed by the State and the Indian tribe. 


Section 1357.15(h) Goals 


Section 432(a)(2) of the Act requires that the CFSP describe the goals to be accomplished in the five-year plan and
describe the methods to be used to measure progress toward the goals. 
We are proposing in paragraph (h) that States and Indian tribes build on their vision statement and philosophy and
develop goals for the next five years. Goals must be stated in the CFSP and must be expressed in terms of the improved
outcome expected for children, youth and families, and for their safety and well-being. Goals also must be stated
in terms of the development of a more comprehensive, coordinated, and effective child and family service delivery
system. 
States and Indian tribes should utilize data on the well being of children and families, needs, resources, and other
information obtained during the planning process in the development of goals.

Section 1357.15(i) Objectives 


We propose in paragraph (i)(1) that goals must be translated into realistic, specific, and measurable objectives
which must be included in the CFSP. The objectives should focus on outcomes for children, youth, and/or families or
on elements of service delivery that are linked to outcomes in important ways. 
Each objective should include interim benchmarks (or due dates) and a long-term timetable, as appropriate. 
Paragraph (i)(2) incorporates the requirements of section 422(b)(6) of the Act that requires the plan to include
objectives directed to covering additional political subdivisions, reaching additional children in need of services,
expanding and strengthening existing services, and developing new types of services. 
The objectives should reflect analysis of information on families and children and on existing child welfare and
related social services, assessing where needs have been growing; where there are gaps in services; what needs should
be prioritized and what populations and geographic areas should be targeted; where there is a capacity for better
integration and accessibility of services for children and families; and what data source(s) will be used to measure
the outcomes of services. 
Well-stated objectives will reflect the work of the State and Indian tribe during the consultation, coordination,
and information analysis processes. Objectives also will reflect State and Indian tribal priorities, funding decisions,
and strategies for implementing child and family services. 
The following illustrate how an objective might be drafted. 
For example, objectives regarding foster care and adoption might be stated: 
 By (date) , appropriately reduce the length of time spent in out-of-home placement for children in State agency
foster care (target population) in the State (geographic area) from (x) days to (y) days or by (x) percentage. 
(Data source to measure progress: 

X

) 
 By (date) , reduce the time between termination of parental rights and finalized adoption by (x) percentage
or (y) time period for all children in State agency care. 
(Data source to measure progress: 

XX

) 
A family support objective might read: 
 By (date) , increase the number and proportion of families with children under age six in high poverty 
neighborhoods in (geographic areas) that receive family support services from 

XXXX

 to 

XXXX

. 
(Data source to measure progress: 

XX

) 
Other objective might read: 
By (date) , reduce the number of reports of child abuse and neglect involving serious injury in four counties/cities
from (x) to (y) . 
(Data source to measure progress: 

XXXX

) 
By (date) , increase the number or proportion of substance abusing parents who receive family preservation, substance
abuse treatment, and other needed services and who are reunited with their children. 
(Date source to measure progress: 

XXXX

) 
We encourage States and Indian tribes to share with us additional examples of goals and measurable objectives or approaches
to drafting measurable objectives. We are considering developing model plan guidelines for States and would encourage
comments on the content and usefulness of such a document. 

We recommend that family preservation and family support services be targeted on populations and in geographic areas
of greatest need. Targeting may include a range of vulnerable populations (children, youth and/or families) in specific
geographic regions, counties, cities, communities, census tracts, or neighborhoods. States should also consider
targeting services to support community-based strategies which draw on multiple funding streams and which bring
a critical mass of resources to bear in high-need communities (e.g., Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Cities, Children's
Cabinet initiatives). 
There is no requirement that services must be statewide, although States are encouraged to move in that direction.

Section 1357.15(j) Measures of Progress 


We are proposing in  1357.15 (j) that States and Indian tribes describe in the CFSP how they will measure the results,
accomplishments, and annual progress toward meeting the goals and objectives in the CFSP. 
Depending on the goals, objectives, and outcomes selected, measuring progress should be based, in part, on quantifiable
indicator data (e.g., numbers of substantiated child abuse and neglect reports) or on the results of activities such
as monitoring mechanisms, quality assurance efforts, other information collection activities, other planning
processes, and internal evaluations. 


SACWIS/AFCARS/NCANDA 


Three interrelated information systems, currently being established, will assist States in obtaining information
to measure the annual progress toward meeting the goals and objectives in the CFSP, to quantify and document the improvements
achieved, as well as identify future problem areas. These systems are the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information
System (SACWIS); the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), a part of the SACWIS; and the
National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). The SACWIS/AFCARS data is expected to be available within
the next two to three years during the implementation of the CFSP. Phase I of the NCANDS is operational at the present
time. 
 SACWIS. 
As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, funding is available to States for the planning, design,
development, and installation of Statewide automated child welfare information systems. Such systems must be comprehensive
in that they must meet the requirements for an Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) required
by section 479 (b)(2) of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations. To the extent practicable, these systems
must also be capable of interfacing with State child abuse and neglect automated systems and with State automated
systems for determining eligibility for title IV-A assistance. The Department must also determine that the
system will be likely to provide more efficient, economical, and effective administration of the programs under
title IV-B and title IV-E of the Act. 
Enhanced Federal funding at the 75 percent matching rate is provided for such activities as well as for the cost of hardware
components beginning October 1, 1993. This funding rate is eliminated in the statute after September 30, 1996, at
which time a Federal matching rate of 50 percent is available. Also effective October 1, 1993, Federal financial participation
is available for the operation of such systems at the 50 percent matching rate. 
 AFCARS.
The purpose of AFCARS is to collect information on children in foster care and children adopted through the public
child welfare system. This information will be essential for data analysis and reporting, addressing program management
issues, and making policy and planning decisions. 
The AFCARS final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 in December of 1993. The first reporting period is 
October 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995 for which data must be received in ACF no later than May 15, 1995. 
 NCANDS.
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) is continuing the development and implementation of the National
Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). The NCANDS consists of two parts: 

 The Summary Data Component (SDC), a compilation of key indicators of State child abuse and neglect statistics;
and 
 The Detailed Case Data Component (DCDC), a compilation of detailed case-level data that can be used to examine
trends and issues in the field. 
NCANDS summary data has been collected for the last three years. The most recent information and data regarding the
NCANDS is published in a report entitled ``Child Maltreatment 1992: Reports From the States to the National Center
on Child Abuse and Neglect.'' This report is available through the Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information
(800-FYI-3366 or 703-385-7565). When this national data base on child abuse and neglect is
fully implemented, it will have the flexibility to respond to a wide range of policy and program analysis needs.

Section 1357.15(k) Baseline Information 


In paragraph (k) we propose both general and specific requirements for the collection, analysis, and use of planning
related information. 
In section 1357.15(k)(1), we are proposing to require that States and Indian tribes base the development of the CFSP
goals, objectives, and funding and service decisions on an analysis of available information on the well-being of
children and families; the needs of children and families; the nature, scope, and adequacy of existing child and family
and related social services programs; and the trends of these indicators over time. 
We further propose that additional and updated information must also be obtained throughout the five-year period
to annually measure the progress in accomplishing the goals and objectives. We do not require the collection of specific
measures or indicators in recognition of the variety of kinds of information available to States and Indian tribes.

Paragraph (k)(2) requires the collection of specific information about existing family preservation and family
support services, because we believe this information is important, widely available, and central to the CFSP development
and implementation process. 
In  1357.15(k)(3), we are proposing that the CFSP must include the information used in developing the CFSP;
an explanation of how the information was used to develop the goals and objectives and to determine the specific services
to be provided, the populations to be served, and the geographic areas where services will be available; a description
of how information will be used to measure progress annually over the five-year CFSP period; and explanation of how
information will be used to facilitate the coordination of services. 
A variety of sources of information on the well-being of children and families and service delivery capability are
available. For example, the local United Way agency, Mayor's Offices, anti-poverty agency, other city/county development
offices, academic institutions, and other public and private efforts are sources of information. Many States also
participate in the collection of information on families and children in the Voluntary Cooperative Information
System (VCIS), the ``Kids Count Data Book'' compiled by the Annie E. Casey Foundation which includes county-by-county
profiles. State Health Departments also are sources of information on child fatalities, low birth weight in infants,
teen pregnancy, and child/youth suicides as well as State and local initiatives such as Healthy Start. State Education
Departments frequently have information on children in special education, drop-outs, and expulsions as well as
school-based and after school programs. The Census Bureau, Chamber of Commerce, and the AFDC agency may be sources
of data on economic status indicators such as the percent or number of children in poverty, and percent or number of
families receiving AFDC, Food Stamps, or medical assistance. States and communities preparing applications for
the new funds under the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities Program will also have collected useful data.

The SACWIS and AFCARS data will be a useful tool in measuring progress including among other data, information on the
status of children placed in foster care and those placed in adoption. An additional data collection system, NCANDS,
will report information on child abuse and neglect. 
When fully operational, these data systems will facilitate the quantification and documentation of the improvements
expected and achieved, as well as providing information on the status of the goals and objectives. 
Because we believe so strongly that baseline information is essential to realistic and meaningful planning, goal
setting, and progress measurement and yet recognize the variety of data availability in different States and Indian
tribes, we have included some suggestions of possible indicators of child and family well being and service delivery
status. Some of those indicators will be useful for setting goals and objectives, some for targeting services geographically
and to priority populations, some for detailed service planning, and some for assessing progress. 
(1) 

Examples of indicators on child and family well-being: 

Number of initial reports and substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect, percent of children born addicted
or drug exposed, child death rate, incidence of domestic violence, number of children in out-of-home care, number
of children in psychiatric placements, number of children awaiting adoption, youth in stable living situations
after exiting foster care, and length of time spent in substitute care. 
(2) 

Examples of indicators related to other services systems: 

Percent of low birth-weight babies, percent of births that are to single teens, teen pregnancy rate, immunization
rate, percent of children in poverty, percent of children in single-parent families, percent of families receiving
AFDC, runaway and homeless youth rate, child/youth suicide rates, juvenile violent crime arrest rate, teen violent
death rate, percent teens not in school and not in labor force, percent teens graduating from high school on time, high
school 
dropout rate, and percent of eligible children in Head Start.

(3) 

Examples of indicators on the State's (or the Indian tribe's, as appropriate) service delivery capacity:

 The extent to which child welfare, family preservation, and family support services are available and being provided
(e.g., number and percentage of families served, waiting lists, etc.); the extent to which child welfare workers'
caseloads (intake, protective, foster care, adoption, etc.) permit adequate protection of and service delivery
to children and families; the availability of out-of-home care and placement (including adoption) resources; the
availability of prevention and intervention services; the availability of critically needed services such as housing,
mental health services, and substance abuse treatment; the extent to which existing services are coordinated with
the provision of other child and family services, particularly child protective services and independent living
services (e.g., indicators of successful referrals); and the funding resources and expenditures, geographic availability,
numbers of persons served, and insufficient service capacity (unmet needs) related to these services. 
(4) 

Examples of indicators States or Indian tribes, as appropriate, might use or seek to develop relating to strengthening
the delivery of services and accomplishing goals and objectives:

 The extent to which resources are available for training, technical assistance, and consultation, including leadership
development, staff development, and interdisciplinary 
training; the existence and utilization of quality assurance measures, program development and management and
data analysis; and the implementation, expansion, and utilization of management information systems. 
Indian tribes will want to obtain a general picture of the well-being of children and families in their area of jurisdiction
and use available data in determining goals, objectives, and services in the CFSP. Indian tribes should use the examples
of indicators and suggested sources of information as it meets their needs and circumstances. 
The requirement in paragraph (k)(2) for the collection and analysis of statewide information on family preservation
and family support services is an extension of the requirement in the FY 1994 Program Instructions. Most States and
Indian tribes have begun to identify existing family preservation and support programs as a part of their consultation,
coordination of services, and planning processes. Specific information on geographic availability; mismatches
among scope, availability, and family needs; and the identifications of both public and privately funded programs
must be known as the basis for State decisions on future services funding. 

Finally, the collection and analysis of data is related not only to the priorities and outcomes the States and Indian
tribes want to achieve but should be used in the consultation and coordination processes to identify what additional
data are needed, which data will serve as baseline information on which to measure progress, and what future goals
and objectives the CFSP should address. 
We ask States to comment on their experiences identifying and gathering existing statewide baseline information
including information on the well-being and needs of children and families; the quality and usefulness of the information
gathered or expected to be gathered; information on the nature, scope, and adequacy of existing child- and family-related
social service programs; and data on existing family preservation and family support services (including important
gaps in service and mismatches between available services and family needs). 
We solicit comment not only on the proposed indicators and their usefulness in planning, but also recommendations
on how the indicators might be improved. We also seek comments on the usefulness of defining indicators more concisely
so that uniform definitions can be developed.

Section 1357.15(l) Consultation 


In  1357.15(l), we are proposing to implement Section 432(b)(1) of the law. As a condition of CFSP approval,
Section 432 requires that the plan be developed by the State and the Indian tribe after consultation with a wide range
of appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies and community-based organizations with experience in administering
services for children and families (including family preservation and family support services). 
Briefly, we are proposing, in paragraph (l)(1), that States must describe in the CFSP the internal and external consultation
process used to obtain broad and active involvement of major actors across the entire spectrum of the child and family
service delivery system in the development of the CFSP and to explain how this process was coordinated with or was a
part of other planning processes in the State. 
Paragraph (l)(2) proposes that Indian tribes carry out a consultation process involving representatives of child
and family services programs within their areas of jurisdiction and appropriate to their needs and circumstances.

In paragraph (l)(3), we propose nine categories of agencies, organizations, and individuals with whom the State
and the Indian tribes, as appropriate, must consult. 
Finally, paragraph (l)(4), proposes that the CFSP must contain a description of how each grantee will ensure that
an active consultation process continues over the five-year period. 
Both those States and Indian tribes with experience in providing family preservation and family support, and those
with little experience in providing youth service can benefit from a broad, active consultation process. Overall,
the process will strengthen the comprehensive planning and implementation of the CFSP. Specifically, it will provide
expert guidance to and assist in the development of the CFSP, including the selection of goals, objectives, and outcomes,
and the design and expansion of family preservation, family support, and child welfare services; and support agency
efforts to address common problems which diminish child and family well-being. 
We have not mandated a particular consultation process to carry out this statutory provision. We recognize that there
may be existing processes, such as State Children's Cabinets and the State Child and Adolescent Service System Program
(CASSP) that can be used in the development of the CFSP. However, we have proposed specific minimum requirements which
we believe are necessary to assure an active planning process, reflecting broad experience and expertise, and leading
to the development of a plan that is more than a ``paper exercise.'' 
The consultation process will also be closely linked to service coordination. Collaborative initiatives to improve
access to service delivery can develop by consulting with others in the field of child and family services. The information
generated during the consultation process may also supplement the collection of baseline information required
for the development of goals, objectives and funding decisions in  1357.15 (k). 
We believe that the nine required categories of participants in the consultation process proposed in paragraph (l)(3)
represent a minimal level of programmatic, political/administrative, and experiential involvement in this process.
We encourage States and Indian tribes to go beyond this proposed list and include other categories of organizations
and individuals based on State and local circumstances. 

This list of participant categories emphasizes both an internal and external consultation process because we believe
it is critical to include the expertise of offices within the child and family service agency as well as the experience
of community-based organizations and others. 
The internal consultation process is particularly important to assure the participation of all major programs in
the child and family services continuum. The active involvement of child protective services and the independent
living program is 
critical, given the requirement for information on these program areas in the plan. 
With regard to consultation with courts, we want to call the States' attention to the collaborative requirements
between courts and State agencies in a new program of grants to the highest State Court in each State. Beginning in FY
1995, that court is eligible for a grant from ACF to assess and improve the handling of child welfare judicial proceedings
under the new ``Court Improvement Program,'' authorized by Pub. L. 103-66. Courts are strongly encouraged
to collaborate with the State title IV-B agency in their assessment and improvement activities. A Program Instruction
was issued June 27, 1994, to the highest State Courts requesting applications for FY 1995 funds.

Given the differing organizational structure, contacts, and resources available to each Indian tribe, the tribal
consultation process will vary from the State process. If an Indian tribe has another planning process in place, we
encourage it to build on the existing process rather than duplicating efforts. 

Depending on the circumstances, including availability of resources, Indian tribes may choose to include other
interested individuals and organizations, as appropriate. Federal and federally assisted programs operated by
the Tribe should be involved, e.g., Family Violence Prevention and Services, Community Services block grant, the
JOBS program, Head Start. Additionally, if the Indian Health Service and/or the Bureau of Indian Affairs is providing
services within the Tribes' area of jurisdiction, representatives from these agencies also should be involved in
the tribal consultation process. The Department of Education provides supplemental funds for tutoring, home/school
liaison, and cultural activities to both public and BIA schools serving Indian children. Representatives of this
program may also be an appropriate participant. Indian tribes also may wish to involve representatives from other
Indian tribes, especially those with experience in child welfare, family support, and family preservation services.


Paragraph (l)(4) requires a description of the ongoing consultation process. Progress on goals and objectives in
the CFSP will need to be reviewed annually and revisions made to reflect changed circumstances, if necessary. Participants
can offer updated information, suggestions regarding revisions in the goals and/or objectives, and advice regarding
funding of services for the upcoming fiscal year. These activities will be part of the annual progress reviews and
services reports described in  1357.16. 

In summary, from consultation with these internal and external sources, the States and tribes could learn the current
status of child and family well-being in a variety of areas; gain insight on needs, existing services, and gaps; receive
advice on controversial or challenging issues; gain support for their own efforts to improve child and family services;
and cultivate activities to coordinate services. This wealth of expertise from a collection of individuals and organizations,
in conjunction with an analysis of baseline information, is needed to develop and fully implement the comprehensive
child and family services plan.

Section 1357.15(m) Services Coordination 



In  1357.15(m), we propose to implement sections 432(a)(3) and 422(b) of the Act which require that the plan
provide for coordination of services under the plan with the provision of services or benefits under other Federal
or federally assisted programs serving the same populations. 

We have not mandated a specific service coordination process because State, local, and Tribal needs and circumstances
vary. In addition, many States and Indian tribes have a number of existing processes and coordination efforts already
in place to carry out this requirement. 

We have mandated in paragraph (m)(1), however, that the State's on-going coordination process must include representatives
of the child and family services provided by the State agency as well as other service delivery systems providing social,
health, education, and economic services to children. 

We propose in paragraph (m)(2), that the State's CFSP must describe how services under the plan will be coordinated
over the five-year period with services or benefits under other Federal and federally assisted programs serving
the same populations to achieve the goals and objectives in the plan. Additionally, we propose that the description
must include the participants in the service coordination process and examples of how the process led or will lead
to additional coordination of services. 

With respect to Indian tribes, in paragraph (m)(3), we propose that the Indian tribe must include in the coordination
process representatives of other Federal or federally assisted child and family services or related programs as
appropriate to their circumstances. The Indian tribe's CFSP must describe how services under the plan will be coordinated
over the five-year period with services or benefits under other Federal or federally assisted programs serving the
same populations to achieve the goals and objectives in the plan. For example, the Tribe may coordinate family preservation,
family support and/or child welfare services provided by the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
if these agencies are providing services within the Tribe's jurisdiction. They may also coordinate services with
public schools receiving supplemental education funds which may provide support services. The description must
include the participants in the process and examples of how the process led or will lead to additional coordination
of services. 

Examples of services and programs are: 

 Within the State agency: existing family support and family preservation; child abuse and neglect prevention,
intervention, and treatment; foster care, and reunification, adoption, and independent living services; 

 Other public and nonprofit private agencies, including community-based organizations, which provide Federal
or federally assisted services or benefits. (These programs may be administered within the State title 
IV-B agency, by another State agency, by private nonprofit agencies and organizations, or by a combination
of public and private support.) 

Examples of major programs are: the social services block grant; title IV-A (income maintenance, child care,
employment and training); title IV-A (emergency assistance); child support; maternal and child health; title
XIX (Medicaid, EPSDT); mental health and substance abuse services; child abuse prevention (Children's Trust Funds);
transitional living; runaway youth and youth gang prevention; education; developmental disabilities; juvenile
justice; early childhood education and child development programs (Head Start); domestic violence; housing; nutrition
(Food Stamps, Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)); child care and development
block grant and other child care programs; the community services block grant; Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
Communities program (EZ/EC); education (school-based services); and justice programs. 

We believe that the ultimate purpose of service coordination is to improve the well-being of children, youth and families.
Focus group participants, and others, emphasized that effective coordination of a broad spectrum of services provides
a holistic approach to serving children and families and increases the likelihood of matching families' needs with
appropriate services rather than merely providing available services. Their view was that, in isolation, individual
services are not likely to address the needs of children and families; many families need support and services that
transcend any single agency mission; no one agency has the resources to meet all needs of all families; vulnerable
families with multiple needs are less likely to independently access and integrate all the services they need; and
service systems which view families' needs categorically reduce the likelihood of overall family improvement.

Section 1357.15(n) Services 



At the heart of the State and Indian tribal plans are the child and family services. Paragraph (n) requires a description
of the publicly funded child and family services that will be provided in FY 1995 and FY 1996, based on the requirement
for a description of the family preservation and family support services in section 432(a)(5) of the Act and for a description
of the child welfare services in section 422(b)(5) of the Act. 


Specifically, the State's CFSP must describe the publicly funded child and family services continuum to be provided
in FY 1995 and FY 1996: the family support services; the family preservation services; the child welfare services
(including child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention, and treatment services and foster care); and the services
to support reunification, adoption, kinship care, independent living, or other permanent living arrangement.


The Indian tribe's CFSP must describe the child welfare (including the child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention,
and treatment services and foster care) and/or the family support and family preservation services to be provided
in FY 1995 and FY 1996. 

In addition, we propose in paragraph (n)(3), that for each service, the CFSP must indicate the population(s) to be
served; the geographic areas where services will be available; the estimated number of individuals and/or families
to be served; and the estimated expenditures for these services from Federal, State, local, and donated sources.


This would include, among other sources of funds, expenditure data on title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2, on the two CAPTA
programs, and on the Independent Living Program. Expenditure data must include all services expenditures, i.e.,
those funded directly and those funded through subrecipients. 


We believe that this description of services represents one of the most important sections of the CFSP. Not only will
it provide a comprehensive picture of the services provided and resources available, it can clearly illustrate State
and Indian tribal decision-making in directing services toward the goals and objectives in the CFSP. By providing
a unified picture of the services available, it will form a basis for discussion of future coordination of services
and improved service delivery. This information also will be studied by national evaluators and other researchers.



We believe the requirements of paragraph (n) will not be burdensome as much of the information on child protective
services, child welfare services, foster care, and adoption is already being reported on the current CWS-101,
the Annual Summary of Child Welfare Services (OMB approval no. 0980-0047, expiration date 9/30/95). We propose
to add in the CFSP reporting of information on CAPTA and ILP services (which is currently available). Information
will be reported for the first time on new or expanded family support and family preservation services using subpart
2 funds. 


We have drafted a revised CWS-101 form for illustrative purposes. It is included as an Appendix to the NPRM, but
it will not become a permanent part of the final rule or the Code of Federal Regulations. We welcome suggestions for
additions or improvements in the scope of the description of services.

Section 1357.15(o) Family Preservation and Family Support Services and Linkages to Other Social and Health Services



We are proposing in paragraph (o)(1) that the State must provide information specifically on the development and/or
expansion of family preservation and family support services; how these services relate to existing family preservation
and family support services; and how they link to the child and family services continuum (of which family support
and family preservation services, child protective services, foster care and adoption services, reunification
services, and independent living services, are a part). 

Paragraph (o)(2) proposes to require an explanation in the CFSP of whether and/or how CAPTA and ILP funds are coordinated
with or integrated into the child and family services continuum. 


In paragraph (o)(3), we are proposing that the CFSP include a description of how the services in the child and family
services continuum are linked to services in other Federal and non-federally funded public and nonprofit private
programs, e.g., AFDC, Food Stamps, WIC, child care, health, education, housing, substance abuse, juvenile justice,
Children's Trust Funds, and private foundations. 

In meeting the requirement in paragraph (o)(1), States will use, in part, the information gathered on the availability
of family preservation and family support services ( 1357.15(k)(2)). 
FY 1995 will be the first year in which all States will be implementing title IV-B family preservation and family support
services. Thus, the information in paragraph (o)(1) will provide a national overview of the development, operation,
and/or expansion of family preservation and family support services in all States as well as identify the processes
States are using to develop coordinated systems of care. We believe it also will provide a picture of implementation
efforts and relationships for national evaluation purposes. 


For similar reasons, we are proposing to request the information in paragraphs (o)(2) and (o)(3) on linkages with
other services and service delivery systems. We believe this information will be useful to obtain a clearer understanding
of each State's efforts and activities to bring about services linkages both within the child and family services
continuum and with other public and privately funded service systems. It will also provide a broader national picture
of such efforts. 


Section 1357.15(p) Services in Relation to Service Principles 




We are proposing in  1357.15(p) that the CFSP describe how the child and family services are designed to assure
the safety and protection of children, as well as the preservation and support of families, and the how services in
the CFSP are or will be designed to meet the other service principles in 45 CFR 1355.25, e.g., services that are flexible,
easily accessible, and respectful of cultural and community strengths. We believe these principles are the basis
for the development of effective, responsive, and quality services programs.

Section 1357.15(q) Services in Relation to Permanency Planning 



We are proposing in  1357.15(q) that the State CFSP must describe how these services will help meet the permanency
provisions for children and families in sections 427 and 471 of the Act, e.g., preplacement preventive services,
reunification and adoption services, and long-term foster care/independent living services. 


The ``permanency provisions'' were enacted by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-272)
which was passed in an effort to improve child welfare services nationwide; it focused on the importance of providing
preventive and crisis intervention services and establishing permanency for the children in foster care. Through
permanency planning, children were to be placed in permanent living arrangements as quickly as possible. At the heart
of this concept is the ``reasonable efforts'' requirement to prevent family separation in cases where a child could
be kept safely at home, provide appropriate services for family reunification once a child was placed in foster care,
or to make another permanent living arrangement, such as adoption. 


We believe that the funds authorized by the new family preservation and family support legislation provide an opportunity
for States to recommit themselves to the goals of 

Pub. L. 96-272 and to use these funds to help bring about the changes that will assure permanency for all children.





Section 1357.15(r) Decision-Making Process: Selection of family Support Programs for Funding
 


We are proposing in  1357.15(r) that the State's CFSP include an explanation of how agencies and organizations
were selected to provide family support services and how these agencies and organizations meet the requirement that
family support services be ``community-based.'' This paragraph proposes to implement section 431(a)(2) of the
Act which states that ``family support services means community-based services to promote the well-being of children
and families * * *'' 

Community-based services can be provided under a variety of auspices. (See 

 1357.10(c).) Therefore, we urge the State to consider a wide range of family support providers in selecting
the most appropriate agencies or organizations to provide this service based on the goals and objectives in the CFSP.
These may include community-based organizations (CBOs), public or private nonprofit agencies, and Indian tribal
organizations. 


We considered requiring the State to pass through a certain percentage of the funds to CBOs to provide family support
services but concluded that the circumstances in each State are so varied and allotments to the States are not large
enough to justify such a requirement. 

In making funding decisions, however, we strongly recommend that States examine the work and accomplishments of
community-based organizations and look to them as highest priority potential providers of family support services.
It is these organizations, based in and trusted by the community, which typically have the knowledge and expertise
to provide these services.

Section 1357.15(s) Significant Portion of Funds Used for Family Support and Family Preservation Services





We are proposing in  1357.15(s) that the State (not the Indian tribes) specify in the CFSP the percentage of FY
1995 and FY 1996 family preservation and family support funds (title IV-B, subpart 2) that the State will expend
for each type of service. States should provide an explanation for how this distribution was reached and how it meets
the requirement that a ``significant portion'' of the service funds must be spent for both family preservation and
family support services. 


Paragraph (s) is based on a statutory requirement in section 432(a)(4) of the Act which provides that a ``significant
portion'' of the service expenditures must be used for family preservation services and family support services.
While there is no minimum percentage that defines significant, we have proposed that the State's rationale will need
to be especially strong if the request for either allocation is below 25 percent. 


We considered a number of alternatives based on recommendations from focus group participants and others: 


 That we require the State to allocate equal amounts or a fixed amount for both family preservation and family
support services; 


 That we prescribe a certain amount to be spent on each service and require States to pass through the family support
allocation directly to CBOs to provide family support services; 

 That a minimum of a third of the service dollars be used for family support; a third for family preservation;
and the remainder for either family support services, family preservation services or a combination of the approaches
depending on the needs of the State and community; and 

 That we allow the State agency to have complete flexibility to decide how to expend the funds. 


We recognize that there are differences among the States in the level at which States and communities are operating
services programs. We also recognize that the needs of families and children are not identical in all jurisdictions.
Therefore, our proposal reflects our desire to provide flexibility to accommodate a wide range of differences among
States, to reflect the legislative history, and to strike a reasonable balance that assures the requirements of the
Act are met. 




Section 1357.15(t) Staff Training, Technical Assistance and Evaluation 



Section 1357.15(t)(1), is based on section 422(b) of the Act. We are proposing that States include in the CFSP a staff
development and training plan which addresses the two title IV-B programs. This training plan must also be combined
with the training plan under title IV-E based on 45 CFR 1356.60(b)(2). 

In paragraph (t)(2), we have proposed that the technical assistance activities that will be undertaken to support
the goals and objectives in the plan be described in the CFSP. 

In paragraph (t)(3), we propose that the State's CFSP provide a description of any evaluation and/or research activities
on child and family services, underway or planned, and how they relate to the goals and objective in the CFSP. 


On-going training and technical assistance activities are critical to support the continuous improvement efforts
under the five-year CFSP. Focus group participants recommended training for the entire staff for the child and family
services agency in order to implement the new vision and the principles of child and family services, including county
administrators, supervisors, front-line staff, foster parents, State administrators, and volunteers who provide
services. 

Furthermore, they emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary training, particularly including the courts
which carry out requirements related to child protective services, foster care and permanency planning. 


Regarding our proposal for information on evaluations in paragraph (t)(3), we want to emphasize that States are not
required to conduct evaluations and/or research activities related to the CFSP. We know, however, that some States
are conducting such activities, and we are interested in learning about these. We know, for example, that a few States
use CAPTA funds for research activities and a few States are undertaking studies to evaluate family preservation
services. 


Section 435 of the law requires the Department to conduct national evaluations on the effectiveness of family preservation
and family support programs. The Department has recently released an RFP for three national evaluation studies.
To the extent feasible, we intend to coordinate these national evaluation projects with evaluations being conducted
by States, and we look forward to the States' participation in the national studies. We also encourage States to participate
in a GAO study currently underway to collect information for a report to Congress on family support and family preservation.

Section 1357.15(u) Quality Assurance


We are proposing in  1357.15(u) that the State describe in the CFSP the quality assurance system it will use to
regularly assess the quality of services provided under the CFSP. 
There is agreement by practitioners in the field and others that the quality of child welfare services needs improvement.
This includes both quality standards for services as well as best practices for casework. We also consider quality
services to be an integral part of achieving better outcomes for children and families. 
We encourage and support State efforts as they develop creative ways to determine and strengthen the effectiveness
of their services. In designing, expanding, and implementing quality assurance activities, States may wish to refer
to the principles in 45 CFR 1355.25. Examples of quality assessment techniques include: 
 Soliciting input on the effectiveness of services from public and private service providers, parents, foster
parents, children and youth, other clients, and various representatives of the public. 
 Reviewing case records based on a random sample of cases representative of the population of children and families
served. 
 Compliance with the recommended standards of national professional organizations serving children and
families e.g., Child Welfare League of America, Council on Accreditation of Child and Family Service. 
 Establishing specific reporting requirements to monitor contractual service providers. 
We considered establishing minimum Federal standards for quality services. However, due to the wide range of differing
State circumstances, we decided that, at this point, it should be left to each State to design its own quality assurance
system. ACF may review, at some later date, the quality assurance systems established by the States and may consider
alternate approaches to improve the quality of services. We solicit recommendations for model approaches and procedures
as well as measures or indicators of quality deemed to be basic. 


Section 1357.15(v) Distribution of the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report 


Section 432(a)(5) requires that an annual report on services (Annual Progress and Services Report) must be made available
to the public. Section 1355.21(c) also requires that the title IV-B and IV-E plans be made available for
public review and inspection. We are proposing in  1357.15(v) to further implement these requirements by specifying
that the CFSP must include a description of how the State and the Indian tribe will make these documents available.
In addition, we propose to require that State agency and Indian tribal organizations within the State receiving title
IV-B, subpart 2 funds, exchange copies of their CFSPs and their Annual Progress and Services Reports. 
We believe it will be useful to States and Indian tribes to share the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Reports,
both with each other and with those individuals, agencies, and organizations a part of the ongoing consultation and
coordination effort. Such dissemination can lead to increased support and coordination of services. Annual Progress
and Services Reports may also be used in preparing briefings for State Advisory Councils, State legislators and budget
officials, and in highlighting accomplishments in the media. 
We have not specified the form or process such distribution should take. A variety of dissemination methods may be
used, e.g., newspapers, newsletters, distribution to participants in the planning process, meetings with advocacy
and constituency organizations, and electronic bulletin board notices.

Section 1357.16 Annual Progress Reviews and Services Reports 


This new section of Part 1357 implements and closely follows the requirements of section 432 of the Act. In summary,
sections 432 (a)(2) and (a)(5) require that once the five-year plan is developed and in operation, the State and the
Indian tribe annually must review the progress made in accomplishing the goals in the plan; and, on the basis of the
annual (interim) review, must: 
 Periodically update or revise the statement of goals in the plan, if necessary, to reflect changed circumstances;

 Prepare, send to ACF, and make available to the public, a description of the services that will be provided in
the immediately succeeding fiscal year under the plan; and 
 Include in the description of services the population(s) to be served and the geographic area(s) where services
will be available. 
Paragraph (a) reflects the statutory requirement for an annual review of progress toward accomplishing the goals
and objectives in the plan and the preparation of an Annual Progress and Services Report, based on updated information.
It also requires that the State and the Indian tribe involve the agencies, organizations, and individuals who are
a part of the on-going consultation and coordination process in the development of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4),
i.e., revisions in the statement of goals and objectives and descriptions of services to be provided in the up-coming
fiscal year. 
Paragraphs (a) (1) through (7) propose that the content of the report must include: A report on specific accomplishments
and progress made toward meeting goals and objectives; any revisions to the goals and objectives; a description of
the continuum of services to be provided in the upcoming year (see  1357.15 (n)); information on training, technical
assistance, research, evaluation, and management information systems efforts; and, for States only, information
required to document the maintenance of effort (supplantation) requirement. 
The annual review must be based on updated information in order to measure progress in achieving the goals and objectives
in the CFSP. States and Indian tribes may utilize various sources of information (as they did in establishing the goals
and objectives in the five-year plan) such as future State management information system reports (e.g., SACWIS/AFCARS/NCANDS);
other planning processes; available public and private data sources (e.g., health departments, ``Kids Count Data
Book''); and outcomes of other activities such as monitoring, quality assurance efforts, and service delivery improvements.

We believe the information we propose to require in the Annual Progress and Services Report, like the information
required in 45 CFR 1357.15(n), is a modest extension of information available to and, for most of the services in the
continuum, already being provided to ACF. We also believe that this information is and will be important, useful,
and necessary as States, Indian tribes, public and private agencies and organizations, advocacy groups, parents,
and others continue to work over the five-year plan period to bring about improved well-being for children and families.

In paragraph (b) we propose deadlines for submitting the Annual Progress and Services Report to ACF, based on the requirement
in section 432(a)(5). 
In paragraph (c), we specify the information that should be reported by those States and Indian tribes that used FY
1994 funds for services. 
Paragraph (d) proposes to require each State and Indian tribe to make the Annual Progress and Services Reports available
to the agencies and organizations and others with whom they are consulting and working to coordinate services. We
do not specify a mechanism(s) that must be used to do this; we believe there are many options for this purpose including
newsletters, public reports to the media, and use of electronic bulletin boards. 
Paragraphs (e) and (f) reflect requirements in section 432 (a)(2) of the Act for a final review in FY 1999 of progress
made toward accomplishing the goals and objectives in the five-year plan and the development of a new plan for the next
five-year period. States and Indian tribes must conduct a final review; prepare a final Progress and Services report;
send the final report to ACF, and make it available to the public; and, in consultation with a broad range of agencies,
organizations, practitioners, and others, develop a new five-year plan following the requirements in  1357.15.

Section 1357.20 Child Abuse and Neglect Programs


This section is revised to update and correct the citations to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and to include
the subject of those citations for clarity. 


Section 1357.30 State Fiscal Requirements (Title IV-B, Subpart 1, Child Welfare Services) 


In this section, we are proposing a number of editorial and technical changes and one major policy change regarding
time limits on expenditures for subpart 1 funds. The editorial and technical changes are: revising the section title
to indicate that these fiscal provisions apply only to States receiving funds under title IV-B, subpart 1; adding
titles as needed to all paragraphs in this section; redesignating paragraphs as needed for clarity; and adding a reference
to title IV-B, subpart 1, in paragraphs (a), (d), (e)(3), and the introductory language to paragraphs (e) and
(e)(2) for specificity and clarity. The major policy change regarding time limits on expenditures is found in new
paragraph (i). 
Current rules in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section require an obligation period (within the year the Federal funds
were awarded) and a liquidation period either ``within two years or the period within which claims must be filed under
title IV-B, whichever is earlier.'' These requirements have proven to be unnecessarily confusing to and burdensome
on States. 
Therefore, we propose to delete the requirement for an obligation period and propose that subpart 1 funds must be expended
(liquidated) by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded. This will
mean an identical expenditure period for funds under title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2, and the independent living
program. We believe this simplification and congruence of rules will be welcomed by States administering these programs.
A conforming amendment has been made in 45 CFR 1355.30 to clarify that 45 CFR part 95, subpart A, is not applicable to
title IV-B programs. 


Section 1357.32 State Fiscal Requirements (Title IV-B, Subpart 2, Family Preservation and Family
Support Services) 


We propose to add a new  1357.32 to specify the fiscal requirements for the State administration of title IV-B,
subpart 2. We considered putting the fiscal requirements for both subpart 1 and subpart 2 of title IV-B in one
section, but because of the considerable differences in statutory requirements, this did not appear to be a useful
approach. 
The proposed regulation reflects statutory requirements in sections 432, 433, and 434 of the Act. 
In paragraph (d), the requirement for 75 percent Federal reimbursement of allowable expenditures and the matching
rate also is taken from the Act (it is the same reimbursement rate for both subparts 1 and 2). The State's match may be
computed either as 25 percent of total funds or 33 percent of the Federal share. 
Paragraph (e) contains the statutory requirement against supplantation, i.e., using subpart 2 funds to take the
place of funds currently being spent for family support or family preservation services, thus reducing the level
of services being provided. 
Section 432(a)(7) of the Act requires that funds under subpart 2 must not be used to supplant ``Federal or non-Federal
funds'' for these services. We propose to define ``non-Federal'' to mean State and local public funds. Nongovernmental
funds would not be included. 
We believe States should be held accountable for a maintenance of effort, and ACF will be collecting information annually
on State level spending to monitor this provision. Local public entities will provide assurances on maintenance
of effort to the State and maintain sufficient information to document this maintenance of effort upon request.

Paragraph (g) on administrative costs reflects the requirement in section 432 (a)(4) of the Act that States using
funds for services may not use more than ten percent of total Federal and State funds under title IV-B, subpart
2, for administrative costs. 
We received many recommendations on how administrative costs should be defined, e.g., providing a complete list
of all items considered ``administrative'' or allowing States to use their own definition of administrative costs.

In paragraph (g) we have proposed what we believe is a reasonable yet flexible approach by defining administrative
costs as those costs allocable to title IV-B, subpart 2, in a State's cost allocation plan for auxiliary functions
to support development and implementation of the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services
Report. These auxiliary functions (e.g., costs incurred for a common or joint purpose) may include but are not limited
to such items as procurement; payroll; management, maintenance, and operation of space and property; and indirect
costs. 
As the funds a State will receive under subpart 2 are not large, we believe most States easily will be able to identify
such costs equal to ten percent of their allotment, based on their cost allocation plans. (Administrative costs over
and above the ten percent limit must be funded from other non-Federal sources of funds.) 
Also we have added a clarification in paragraph (g)(3) to explain that costs directly associated with implementing
the CFSP are not considered administrative costs, e.g., service delivery, ongoing planning activities, training,
supervision. 
Finally, paragraph (g) also proposes that, for the purpose of computing the 10 percent limitation, the administrative
costs of State subrecipients must also be taken into account. The State, therefore, must calculate what it will spend
on administrative costs, and what will be available for subrecipients and obtain assurances from the subrecipients
to ensure that the total for administrative costs does not exceed the 10 percent limitation. 
We look forward to receiving alternate recommendations if this approach to defining administrative costs is viewed
as not workable. 


Additional Issue for Public Comment: Permitting In-Kind Matching Funds 


We are requesting public comment on an issue about which we did not propose a change in current policy. In revised fiscal
sections  1357.30 and  1357.40, and proposed new fiscal sections  1357.32 and  1357.50 for
States and Indian tribes we have continued the current requirement that matching funds must be cash or donated funds.
We are interested in public comment, however, on whether we should permit States and Indian tribes to use in-kind funds
to meet the match requirement under the title IV-B programs. 
On the one hand, allowing in-kind funds to be used to meet the match requirement provides additional flexibility to
States and Indian tribes in providing the match; it may also encourage participation in the services program among
community-based organizations. On the other hand, there has been some concern in other programs where in-kind match
has been permitted that the provision may be used inappropriately and may not ensure that the full matching resources
are new resources directed to the purpose of the legislation. 
We would welcome the views particularly of States, Indian tribes, nonprofit and community-based agencies and organizations,
and advocacy organizations on this issue. We especially would appreciate not only a statement of position but also
the reasons for the position and how allowing (or not allowing) in-kind match would (or would not) benefit the title
IV-B programs.

Section 1357.40 Direct Payments to Indian Tribal Organizations (Title IV-B, Subpart 1, Child Welfare
Services)


This section contains fiscal and administrative requirements applicable to Indian tribes eligible for and administering
grants under title IV-B, subpart 1. 
Most of the changes proposed in this section are editorial, i.e., to revise the title of the section and paragraphs
(d)(1) and (d)(5) to clarify that this section applies only to Indian tribal grantees under title IV-B, subpart
1; to delete paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) (on joint planning, title IV-B plan requirements, submittal of
the plan and the annual budget request, and coordination of services respectively) as these provisions are now incorporated
into the child and family services plan requirements in  1357.15; and to redesignate remaining paragraphs.

One major change has been proposed. A new paragraph (b) proposes that in order to receive funding under subpart 1, an
Indian tribe must have in effect an approved five-year child and family services plan that meets the requirements
applicable to Indian tribes in  1357.15. 
Currently, Indian tribes may submit their title IV-B (subpart 1, child welfare) services plan at one, two, or
three year intervals with annual updates. We believe a five-year plan will not only reduce administrative burden
but will enable the Indian tribe to deliver services in the context of a plan that includes both short-term objectives
and long-term goals, supported by consultation and coordination activities, leading to more coordinated and effective
services. 
As noted in the discussion on  1357.15, not all requirements are applicable to Indian tribes. We especially
ask for comment from the Indian tribes, either on this section or on  1357.15, as to whether the five-year comprehensive
plan requirements as proposed will help Indian tribes better serve children and families. 
New paragraph (c) entitled ``Information related to the requirements of Section 427 of the Act'' retains language
from current paragraphs (c)(9) through (c)(15). The remaining provisions in current paragraph (c) are found in  1357.15(b).

In paragraphs (b)(2) and (g)(5), we have summarized and corrected references to specific fiscal and administrative
requirements for Indian tribes. The cross references in paragraph (g)(5) pertain to five requirements in  1357.30
applicable to Indian tribes which we have not repeated in this section.

Section 1357.50 Direct Payments to Indian Tribal Organizations (Title IV-B, Subpart 2, Family Preservation
and Family Support Services) 



Section 1357.50 is a new section added to propose requirements applicable only to Indian tribes eligible for and administering
grants under title IV-B, subpart 2. We considered combining into one section all fiscal and administrative
requirements for Indian tribes under title IV-B, subparts 1 and 2 but, as with the State fiscal requirements
in   1357.30 and 1357.32, the statutory requirements for Indian tribes are different in each subpart.
It appeared to be simpler and clearer to put them in separate sections. 

In paragraph (a), we have included the definitions from section 431(a) of the Act for the terms ``Alaska Native organization,''
``Indian tribe,'' and ``tribal organization.'' These are included for clarity; the tribal allotments are computed
based on the first two definitions, and the definition of tribal organization is included because section 434 of the
Act provides that ACF will pay to the tribal organization of the Indian tribe any amount to which the Indian tribe is
entitled under subpart 2. 

Paragraph (b)(1) explains the statutory requirement for eligibility for funds in FY 1994 which is based on the Indian
tribe's FY 1995 allotment. (The FY 1995 allotment must be at least $10,000 for the Indian tribe to be eligible in FY 1994.)
Additional explanation on eligibility was sent to Indian tribes and others in Program Instruction ACYF-PI-94-04,
January 18, 1994. 

Paragraph (c) proposes that, beginning in FY 1995, in order to receive title IV-B, subpart 2 funds, an Indian
tribe must submit a comprehensive child and family services plan that meets the requirements applicable to Indian
tribes in  1357.15. 

In order to fund as many eligible Indian tribes as possible under the law, we have proposed in paragraph (d) a process
for adding Indian tribal grantees in FY 1996 through FY 1998. 

For FY 1996, FY 1997, and FY 1998, we propose to calculate allotments as required in section 433 of the Act. Those Indian
tribes whose allotment is at least $10,000 (the minimum for eligibility specified in the law), will be invited to apply.
As in FY 1995, in order to receive funding, the Indian tribe must submit a comprehensive child and family services plan
that meets the requirements applicable to Indian tribes in  1357.15. The statute does not make available 100
percent Federal funds for planning in FYs 1996-1998. 

We want to point out that while this proposal increases the number of Indian tribes receiving funds, it will decrease
the amount the Indian tribes eligible in the first year (FY 1994) will otherwise receive in FYs 1996-98. Although
we have received recommendations that funding additional Indian tribes should be our first priority, we also are
concerned that the size of most of the grants to Indian tribes is small. Indian tribes have been creative in the past
in using comparatively small grants to provide services, but we are concerned that smaller grants will be less effective
in helping Indian tribes develop and operate the needed services. We look forward to hearing from the Indian community
on this proposal. 

Another issue about which we have received many recommendations is that of funding consortia of Indian tribes, e.g.,
to permit two or more tribes to apply for funding whose combined total grant would equal $10,000. We have researched
the legislative history and analyzed the statute and can find no basis for funding consortia, given the clear language
of the law. 

Paragraph (e) specifies that the allotments will be computed based on section 433 of the Act. 

We have accepted recommendations from Indian tribes and other Indian advocacy groups to waive certain statutory
requirements. This waiver authority is based on the Secretary's discretion in section 432(b) of the Act to waive any
provision in section 432 that is determined to be inappropriate to Indian tribes, taking into account the resources,
needs, and other circumstances of the Indian tribe. In paragraph (f), we propose to waive three statutory provisions
for Indian tribes: the ten percent limit on administrative costs, the supplantation provision, and the requirement
that a significant portion of funds must be used for both family preservation and family support services. 

We believe that waiving the supplantation and significant portion provisions are reasonable, given the limited
dollars available to the Indian tribes, our desire to reduce inappropriate requirements, and the circumstances
of tribal services programs. We believe that waiving the ten percent administrative cost limitation and allowing
Indian tribes to use their current negotiated indirect cost rates is reasonable based on the need for flexibility
in working with small grantees and our understanding that, in some cases, some service-related costs are reflected
in the indirect cost rates negotiated by some Indian tribes. 

Paragraph (g) reflects the statutory requirement for a 25 percent match rate. Although we received many recommendations
that this provision also be waived, we do not have the authority to do so. Section 432(b) of the Act permits waivers only
of requirements in section 432. The match requirement is in section 434 of the Act. However, we have included in paragraph
(g)(2) a list of three Federal sources of funds which Indian tribes may use as a source of matching funds. 

Paragraph (h) states the time limit on expenditure of funds (section 434(b) of the Act). This means that Indian tribes
must submit their Standard Form (SF) 269 expenditure reports annually, 90 days after the end of the expenditure period,
i.e., by 
December 30 of each year. In addition, paragraph (h) references other applicable fiscal and administrative requirements
(that may be found in the Program Instruction (ACYF-PI-94-04, January 18, 1994)) and which will
be prepared by ACF in the form of assurances for all grantees. 



III. Impact Analysis 



Regulatory Impact Analysis 



Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be drafted to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking implements statutory authority for a broad consultation
and coordination process leading to the development of a five-year child and family services plan.

<TEXT>
 

The Executive Order also encourages agencies, as appropriate, to provide the public with meaningful participation
in the regulatory process. As described earlier in the preamble, ACF held focus group discussions with State, local,
and tribal officials, and a broad range of private nonprofit agencies, organizations, practitioners, researchers,
parents, and others to obtain their views on planning and implementation issues for this new title IV-B program.
We believe this NPRM reflects, to a considerable degree, the recommendations of the focus group participants for
flexibility, accountability, and reduced administrative burden on both States and Indian tribes. 



Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the impact
of rules and paperwork requirements on small businesses and other small entities. Small entities are defined in the
Act to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations, and small governmental entities. This regulation,
if promulgated, will affect only States and certain Indian tribes. Therefore, the Secretary certifies that this
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule contains information collection activities which are subject to review and approval by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C 35). 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit for OMB approval the reporting
requirements for the five-year comprehensive child and family services plan (CFSP) and Annual Progress and Service
Reports in 45 CFR 1357.15 and 1357.16. The CFSP incorporates previously approved planning requirements for title
IV-B, subpart 1 (OMB control number 0980-0142). 

The Annual Summary of Child Welfare Services (CWS-101) also will be modified and submitted to OMB for approval.
(The CWS-101 currently is approved under OMB control number 0980-0047.) 

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements
should direct them to the agency official(s) designated for this purpose whose name appears at the beginning of this
preamble, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10235, New
Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503. Attn: Wendy Taylor, Desk Officer for ACF/HHS.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 45 CFR Chapter XIII, subchapter G, is proposed to be amended as follows: 
1. Subchapter G is amended by revising the heading to read as follows: 


SUBCHAPTER G_THE ADMINISTRATION ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND 
FAMILIES, FOSTER CARE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS, ADOPTION 
ASSISTANCE, AND CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES 


PART 1355_GENERAL 


2. The authority citation for Part 1355 continues to read as

3. Section 1355.10 is revised to read as follows: 


 1355.10 

Scope. 


Unless otherwise specified, this Part 1355 applies to States and 
Indian tribes and contains general requirements for Federal financial participation under titles IV-E and
IV-B 
of the Social Security Act. 
4. Section 1355.20(a) is amended by revising four definitions and by adding one definition to read as follows: 


 1355.20 

Definitions. 


(a) * * * 


ACYF 

means the Administration on Children, Youth and 
Families, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. 


* * * * *




Commissioner 

means the Commissioner on Children, Youth 
and Families, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 


* * * * * 




Independent Living Program (ILP) 

means the programs and activities established and implemented by the State to assist youth, as defined in section
477(a)(2) of the Act, to prepare to live independently upon leaving foster care. Programs and activities that may

also must make available for public review and inspection the title IV-E State Plan. 
6. A new  1355.25 is added to read as follows: 


 1355.25 

Principles of child and family services. 



The following principles, most often identified by practitioners and others as helping to assure effective services
for children, youth, and families, should guide the States and Indian tribes in developing and operating child and
family services and implementing improvements in service delivery systems. 
(a) The safety and well-being of children and of all family members is assured. When safety can be assured, strengthening
and preserving families is seen as the best way to promote the healthy development of children. One important way to
keep children safe is to stop violence against their mothers.

(b) Services are focused on the family as a whole; service providers work with families as partners in identifying
and meeting individual and family needs; family strengths are identified, enhanced, respected, and mobilized to
help families solve the problems which compromise their functioning and well-being. 
(c) Services promote the healthy development of children and youth, promote permanency for all children, and help
prepare youth emancipating from the foster care system for self-sufficiency and independent living. 
(d) Services may focus on intervention, protection, treatment, or other services to meet the needs of the family and
the best interests of the individual who may be placed in out-of-home care. 
(e) Services are flexible, coordinated, and accessible to families and individuals, often delivered in the home
or the community, and are delivered in a manner that is respectful of and builds on the strengths of community and cultural
groups. 
(f) Services are organized as a continuum, designed to achieve measurable outcomes, and are linked to a wide variety
of supports and services outside the child and family services system (e.g., housing, substance abuse treatment,
mental health, health, education, and job training, child care, informal support networks) which can be crucial
to meeting families' and children's needs. 
(g) Many child and family services are community-based and involve community organizations and residents (including
parents) in their design and delivery. 
(h) Services are intensive enough to meet family needs and keep children safe. The level of intensity and duration
of services needed to achieve these goals may vary greatly between preventive (family support) and crisis intervention
services (family preservation), based on the changing needs of children and families at various times in their lives.
A family or an individual does not need to be in crisis in order to receive services. 
7. Section 1355.30 is revised to read as follows: 


 1355.30 

Other applicable regulations. 


Except as specified, the following regulations are applicable to all programs funded under titles IV-B and
IV-E of the Act.

are used for administrative costs.

in the grantee department or in some other agency, and may include but are not limited to the following: Procurement;
payroll processing; personnel functions; management, maintenance and operation of space and property; data processing
and computer services; accounting; budgeting; auditing; and indirect costs.

(a) 

Definitions.

 

Alaska Native Organization

 means any organized group of Alaska Natives eligible to operate a Federal program under the Indian Self-Determination
Act (Pub.L. 93-638) or such group's designee as defined in section 482(i)(7)(A) of the Act. 



Indian tribe

 means any tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians that is recognized as eligible for
the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; and
for which a reservation (including Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, and former Indian reservations
in Oklahoma) exists. 


Tribal organization

 means the recognized governing body of the Indian tribe. 
(b) 

Eligibility for funds: FY 1994.

 (1) Section 432(b)(2) of the Act provides that the Secretary may not approve a plan of an Indian tribe whose FY 1995 allotment
under subpart 2 would be less than $10,000. Therefore, only those Indian tribes whose FY 1995 allotment is $10,000
or more are eligible to receive funds beginning in FY 1994. 
(2) ACF will pay any amount to which an Indian tribe is entitled to the tribal organization of the Indian tribe. 
(c) 

Eligibility for funds: FY 1995.

 In order to receive funds under title IV-B, subpart 2, in FY 1995, an Indian tribe eligible for planning funds
in FY 1994 must submit a Child and Family Services Plan that meets the applicable requirements in section 1357.15 of
this Part. 
(d) 

Eligibility for funds: FY 1996 through FY 1998.

 (1) ACF will make grants to additional Indian tribes in FYs 1996 through 1998, based on anticipated increases in appropriations.

(2) Allotments will be calculated in FYs 1996, 1997, and 1998 as required in Section 433 of the Act. Those Indian tribes
in each year whose allotment is at least $10,000 will be notified of their eligibility to apply. 
(3) In order to receive funds, an Indian tribe must submit a Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) that meets the applicable
requirements of 45 CFR 1357.15. The plan must cover a one, two, or three year period (between FY 1996-FY 1998),
depending on when the Indian tribe applies. There are no funds available for planning in FYs 1996-98, but the
Regional Office staff of ACF will, through the joint planning process, assist the Indian tribe in developing its CFSP.

(e) 

Allotments.

 Allotments to Indian tribes are computed based on section 433 of the Act and are based on a ratio of the number of children
in each Indian tribe with an approved plan compared to the number of children in all Indian tribes with approved plans,
based on the most current and reliable data available. 
(f) 

Waivers of requirements.

 ACF has waived for Indian tribes three statutory requirements: 
(1) The limitation on administrative costs to 10 percent of total Federal and tribal funds; (Indian tribes may use
the indirect cost rate agreement in effect for the Tribe.); 
(2) The requirement that funds under this program may not be used to supplant other Federal and non-Federal funds;
and 
(3) The requirement that a significant portion of funds must be used for both family support and family preservation
services. 
(g) 

Matching requirement.

 (1) Funds used to provide services in FY 1994 and in subsequent years will be federally reimbursed at 75 percent of allowable
expenditures. (This is the same Federal financial participation rate as title IV-B, subpart 1.) The Indian
tribe's share must be at least 25 percent of the total or 33 percent of the Federal share. Federal funds, however, will
not exceed the amount of the Indian tribe's allotment. 
(2) The Indian tribe's contribution may be in cash or donated funds. In addition, Indian tribes, by statute, may use
the following three Federal sources of funds as matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds. 
(h) 

Fiscal and administrative requirements.

 An Indian tribe must expend all funds by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds
were awarded. Other fiscal and administrative requirements will be found in the compilation of statutory assurances
to be prepared by ACF.
