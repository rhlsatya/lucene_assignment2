Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

Small Grains, Nursery, Potatoes, and Sugarcane Crop Insurance Endorsements



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Extension of Sales Closing Date (Acceptance of Applications).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Effective for the 1995 crop year only, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) herewith gives notice of its
determination to extend the date for acceptance of applications for small grains (wheat, oats, rye, and barley),
sugarcane, potatoes, and nursery crop insurance for all policies having a September 30 sales closing date.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under its regulations for insuring crops, FCIC requires that applications for crop insurance protection must be
filed on or before the policy sales closing date. The small grains, potatoes, surgarcane, and nursery crop insurance
policies have a sales closing date in some areas of September 30. Due to the uncertain nature of improvements being
made to agricultural risk management policies, producers have requested that FCIC extend the sales closing dates
to allow producers opportunity to assess their risk management needs and make an informed decision as to the purchase
of crop insurance. Therefore, to assist those producers who have requested an extension of sales closing date, the
Manager of FCIC has determined that the September 30 sales closing date shall be extended to October 31. 




Under the provisions of the General Crop Insurance Regulations ( 401.8 and  457.8), the sales closing
date for accepting applications may be extended by notice in the 

Federal Register 

upon determination that no adverse selection will result from such extension. FCIC has determined that no adverse
selection will result from this extension.

FCIC will discontinue the acceptance of applications if it determines that the insurance risk because excessive
and adverse conditions develop.



Notice




Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation herewith gives notice that, effective for the 1995 crop year only, applications
for wheat, barley, oats, rye, nursery, potatoes, and surgarcane crop insurance with sales closing prior to October
31, 1994, will be accepted up to the 

close of business on October 31, 1994, 

for producers requesting multiple peril crop insurance coverage. This sales closing may be terminated by the Corporation
prior to October 31, 1994 if the insurance risk becomes excessive and adverse conditions develop.






Authority: 

7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516.



Done in Washington, D.C. on September 29, 1994.

On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted
by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).

On August 4, 1994, the Department received an amendment to the petition alleging that critical circumstances exist
with respect to imports of pipe fittings from Malaysia. In accordance with section 735(a)(3) of the Act, on August
12, 1994, the Department issued a letter to MMCPNF requesting monthly volume and value shipment data for the period
January 1, 1992, through September 27, 1994. The Department has received no reply to this request.



Scope of Investigation



The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'')
having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished
condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions
require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening (

e.g., 

threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,''
``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed
against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the
``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading
7307.93.3000 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 

(``HTSUS'').

Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope
of this proceeding is dispositive.



Period of Investigation



The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994.



Best Information Available




MMCPNF did not respond to our questionnaire. Therefore, we have based our preliminary determination on best information
available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a company
identified by the Department as a respondent refuses to provide requested information.

In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to this methodology, as outline in the
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings, Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings,
from Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (May 3, 1989), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form
required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department
to assign to that company the higher of 1) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or 2) the highest calculated rate
of any respondent in the investigation. (

See Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

996 F. 2d 1185,1191-92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation,
we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, the highest margin calculated in the petition, adjusted for methodological
errors as explained in the Department's initiation notice. The adjusted rate is 194.7 percent.







Critical Circumstances





Petitioner has alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from
Malaysia. Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances
exist if:



(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the U.S. or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject
of this investigation, or


(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and


(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over
a relatively short period.

Since MMCPNF did not respond to our letter of August 12, 1994, we preliminarily determine, as BIA, pursuant to section
776(c) of the Act, that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of pipe fittings from Malaysia.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16(c), we are directing the Customs Service to suspend
liquidation of all entries of pipe fittings from Malaysia that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption
on or after the date 90 days prior to the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.






ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after
our final determination.



Public Comment



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity
to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate
in one is requested, must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department
of Commerce, room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice. Tentatively, this hearing will be
held on November 28, 1994, at 1:00 p.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing
48 hours before the scheduled time.

Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and

1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than November 23, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations
will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.

If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our final determination within 75 days of the signing of this
preliminary determination.

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Karmen, did not make home market or third country sales of the subject merchandise. Therefore, we based FMV on constructed
value (CV), in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act.

Additionally, Karmen reported that it has an arrangement with a Singaporean company, under which the Singaporean
company supplies Karmen with rusty pipe fittings. Karmen reconditions and refurbishes these pipe fittings and exports
them to the Singaporean company's U.S. customer. Karmen claims that since the Singaporean company only pays Karmen
for the refurbishing, and Karmen does not take title to this merchandise, these sales should not be treated as Karmen
sales. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are not treating these refurbished pipe fittings as sales
subject to this investigation. We will further examine this issue for purposes of the final determination.



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether Sivanandha's or Karmen's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value,
we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice.



United States Price



Because Sivanandha's and Karmen's U.S. sales of subject merchandise were made to unrelated purchasers prior to importation
into the United States, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, in accordance
with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology.

We calculated Sivanandha's PP sales based on packed, CIF prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made
deductions to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight, and marine
insurance.

In accordance with Section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we added to Sivanandha's USP the amount of import duties imposed
on inputs which were subsequently rebated upon exportation of the finished merchandise to the United States.

We made an adjustment to U.S. price for excise and sales taxes paid on the comparison sales in India, in accordance with
our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in 

Federal-Mogul, et al. 

v. 

United States, 

834 F. Supp. 1993. See 

Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination and Postponement of Final Determination; Color Negative Photographic
Paper and Chemical Components Thereof from Japan, 

59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994, for an explanation of this tax methodology.

We calculated Karmen's PP sales based on packed, CIF prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions
to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight and marine insurance.
In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the borrowing rate in the United States on short-term dollar-denominated
loans. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see 

Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman 

(September 26, 1994) on file in room B-099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce.



Foreign Market Value



For Sivanandha, in order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a
viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume
of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. As a result, we
determined that Sivanandha's home market was viable.

We adjusted for a excise and sales tax collected in the Indian home market. (

See 

the United States Price section of this notice, above.)

For Karmen, because it sells the subject merchandise only in the U.S. market, we used CV, pursuant to section 773(e)
of the Act. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. imputed
credit costs, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act, we: (1)
Included the greater of either Karmen's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost
of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general
expenses for profit. In reporting its CVs, Karmen allocated labor costs and variable manufacturing overhead in such
a way as to assign equal amounts for new pipe fittings and refurbished pipe fittings. We believe that the allocation
method Karmen used to report CVs results in understating the costs of producing new fittings, because based on our
experience in past cases, we would expect that costs incurred in the early production stages would not be incurred
in refurbishing fittings. Therefore, we have recalculated these costs by assigning all labor and variable manufacturing
overhead costs to the production of new pipe fittings. We will seek additional information on the actual costs for
purposes of the final determination.

Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustments
for differences in movement charges between shipments to the United States and shipments to India. For Sivanandha,
we also made COS adjustments for differences in quality inspection charges, credit and advertising expenses. In
accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we added U.S. indirect selling expenses as an offset to the home market commission,
but capped this addition by the amount of the home market commission. Finally, we deducted home market packing expenses
and added U.S. packing expenses to Sivanandha's FMV, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.



Currency Conversion



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank.

Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation''
section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping
margins are as follows:






Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``(no) product * * *
shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or
export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Since antidumping duties
cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash
deposit or bond for that amount.

Accordingly in this investigation, Sivanandha's FMV is based on home market sales and hence, the antidumping margin
must be adjusted. In the 

Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from
India, 

(59 FR 28337, published June 1, 1994), Sivanandha's export subsidy was 3.53 percent ad valorem, which will be subtracted
from the margins for cash deposit or bonding purposes. The rate listed above reflects this adjustment. Since Karmen
only has U.S. sales, its FMV is based on CV which reflects export subsidies. Because the export subsidies were reflected
in both USP and FMV, the subsidies did not affect the margin calculations using CV.

The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown above. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.



ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.



Public Comment



Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of the issues to be discussed.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary no later than November 16, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 23, 1994. A hearing,
if requested, will be held on November 28, 1994, at 1 p.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce in Room 1414. Parties should
confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours prior to the scheduled time. In accordance with
19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.

We will make our final determination not later than 75 days after the date of this preliminary determination.

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

We calculated Interfit's PP sales based on packed, c.i.f., duty paid, landed prices to unrelated customers in the
United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage,
marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duties, and rebates.

No commissions were paid to unrelated distributors in the United States or home market, and we do not have an appropriate
benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Interfit and its related party are at
arm's length. Therefore, we did not make an adjustment for commissions claimed by Interfit that were paid to its U.S.
subsidiary for various charges incurred in selling the subject merchandise. (

See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany and the United Kingdom,

 56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.)



Foreign Market Value



In order to determine whether Interfit had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that
the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used reported CV for products sold by Interfit in the
United States during the POI.



Cost of Production



Interfit provided incomplete and inappropriate cost data for home market sales. Specifically, Interfit did not
provide COP information for all comparison models sold in France during the POI. Furthermore, Interfit provided
transfer prices for the main input into its pipe fittings. As this input was purchased from related parties, it is the
Department's practice to use the cost of producing the input, rather than the transfer price. See 

Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela 

(58 FR 27522; 1993). Finally, the costs reported by Interfit did not reflect the specific time period requested by
the Department.

Accordingly, we do not have the information necessary to make a determination whether Interfit's home market sales
are being sold below the COP. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act as best information available (``BIA'')
we have determined that all sales in the home market were made at less than the COP and, in accordance with section 773(b)
of the Act, we have based foreign market value on CV.



Constructed Value




We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit.
In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we (1) included the greater of Interfit's reported
general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate, and (2) used the statutory minimum
of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit.

For comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the
two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the rate respondent reported
at which it could borrow in U.S. dollars during the POI. (For further discussions regarding the Department's treatment
of credit in this investigation, please see September 26, 1994, Memorandum to Susan G. Esserman from Barbara R. Stafford
on file in Room B-099 of the Department of Commerce.) We have not made a deduction for the direct selling expenses
reported by respondent. We have determined that these expenses (product liability premiums and inventory carrying
costs) are, in fact, indirect selling expenses.

Because of the deficiencies in the cost data described above, we are requesting further information from Interfit.
We also intend to verify that the prices paid by Interfit to its related suppliers are, in fact, at arms-length.

The CV data originally provided by Interfit did not cover all of the models sold by the company in the United States during
the POI. On September 23, 1994, Interfit supplied the CV data for the remaining models. Because this information was
not received in time to be used in this preliminary determination, we have used BIA for sales involving these models.
As BIA, we have imputed the highest non-aberrational margin calculated from the CV information that Interfit submitted
on September 6, 1994. (

See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain
Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands

, 58 FR 37199; July 9, 1993). In our final determination, we intend to use all the CV data submitted by Interfit so long
as it can be verified.



Currency Conversion



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.



Critical Circumstances



Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from France.
Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:

(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of this investigation, or



(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and



(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over
a relatively short period.



Regarding A(i) above, in determining whether there has been a history of dumping, we normally consider whether there
has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere on such or similar merchandise. Regarding (A)(ii)
above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price sales sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping. (

See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or
Unfinished, from Italy,

 52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987.)



Pursuant to section 733(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have
been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable);
and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. If imports during the period immediately following
the filing of the petition increase by at least fifteen percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we normally consider them massive.



In order to determine whether imports have been massive over a relatively short period of time, we compared the reported
shipments of butt-weld pipe fittings by Interfit to the United States in the seven months after the petition was filed
to the seven months immediately before this period. Our analysis showed that the volume of imports of subject merchandise
to the United States by Interfit had actually decreased over that period of time. (

See,

 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2).) Based on this analysis, we determine that imports of butt-weld pipe fittings from Interfit
were not massive over a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, as one of the criteria enumerated in Section
733(A)(3) of the Act is not met, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances does not exist for imports
of butt-weld pipe fittings from France.




Verification





As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination.




Suspension of Liquidation





In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation
of all entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation''
section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margin, as shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping
margins are as follows:







ITC Notification





In accordance with section 733(f) of this Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.



Public Comment





Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of the issues to be discussed.



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary no later than November 16, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 23, 1994. A hearing,
if requested, will be held on November 28, 1994, at the Department of Commerce in Room 1414. Parties should confirm
by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours prior to the scheduled time. In accordance with 19 CFR
353.3(b), oral presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.



We will make our final determination not later than 75 days after of this preliminary determination.



This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the value-added tax (`VAT'') assessed on comparison sales in Israel, in accordance
with our practice, pursuant to the court of International Trade (``CIT'') decision in 

Federal-Mogul, et al v. United States,

 834 F.Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). (

See Final determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux from France,


59 FR 14136, March 25, 1994).



Foreign Market Value



Carmiel made sales only to the United States and Israel during the POI. Based on the substantial quantity of home market
sales in relation to its U.S. sales, we determined that the home market was viable.

We have preliminarily determined that respondent's method for determining date of sale is not consistent with the
Department's practice. According to the response, Carmiel makes most of its home market sales over the telephone
and does not document these orders. Moreover, the company did not know the specific date of each sale, but claimed to
know the month in which the sale was made. Therefore, Carmiel reported its home market sales as having occurred the
first day of the month in which the sale was made.

Our practice with respect to the date of sale is to use the date of the first 

written

 document which sets the price and quantity for the sale (

see Certain Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe and Tube fittings From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review

 (59 FR 12240, 12241; March 16, 1994) and 

Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Rolling Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, et al.

, (58 FR 39729,39783; July 26, 1993)). In Carmiel's case, the first written document with this information is the invoice.
Thus, according to Commerce practice, Carmiel should have reported home market sales that were invoiced during the
POI.

For purposes of our preliminary determination, however, we have used the sales reported by respondent. we will be
requesting a better explanation of whether the date of sale used by respondent can be documented, or, in the absence
of documentation, a new sales listing before verification.


We have calculated FMV using the delivered prices reported by Carmiel for its home market sales. We adjusted the prices
for discounts offered to home market customers. Also, in light of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, 

13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir., 1994), we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstances-of-sale
provision of 19 U.S.C 1677b(a)(4)(B). This adjustment included home market inland freight.

We also made circumstance-of-sale-adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant
to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the borrowing rate in Israel on short-term New
Israeli Shekel (``NIS'') loans linked to the dollar. In calculating the home market credit expense, we used the borrowing
rate on unliked short-term NIS loans. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation,
please see 

Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman

 (September 26, 1994) on file in room B-099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice. (

See

 the ``United States Price'' Section of this notice, above.)



Currency Conversion



we made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales, as published
in the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics.



Critical Circumstances



Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Israel.
Section 733(e)(1) of the Act Provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:

(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of this Investigation, or

(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and

(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over
a relatively short period.

Regarding A(i) above, in determining whether there has been a history of dumping, we normally look to see whether there
has been an antidumping order in the United States or elsewhere on such or similar merchandise. Regarding (A)(ii)
above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price sales sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping. (

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished,
from Italy, 

52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987.)

Since the calculated preliminary margin for butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel is below 25 percent and there have
been no antidumping orders in the United States or elsewhere pertaining to butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel, the
requirements of section 733(e) have not been met. Therefore, we have determined that critical circumstances do not
exist with respect to imports of butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel.



Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation''
section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping
margins are as follows:






Adjustment of Deposit Rate for Countervailing Duties



Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``[no] product * * *
shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or
export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) or the Act. Since antidumping duties
cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash
deposit or bond for that amount.

Accordingly, the level of export subsidies as determined in the 

Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from
Israel, 

FR 59 28340, June 1, 1994) which was 0.25 percent ad valorem, will be subtracted from the respective margins for cash
deposit or bonding purposes. This results in a deposit rate of 7.08 percent for Carmiel and all other exporters of carbon
steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel. 



ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.



Public Comment



Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of the issues to be discussed.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary no later than November 16, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 23, 1994. A hearing,
if requested, will be held on November 28, 1994, at the U.S. Department of Commerce in Room 1414. Parties should confirm
by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing two days prior to the scheduled date. In accordance with 19 CFR
353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.

We will make our final determination not later than 75 days after of this preliminary determination.

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

United States Price


Because AST's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to an unrelated distributor in
the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances,
we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.
We calculated PP based on packed, c.i.f. port of import prices to an unrelated customer in the United States. We made
deductions to the U.S. price for foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight and marine insurance.
We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Thailand, in accordance
with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in 

Federal-Mogul, et al v. United States, 

834 F. Supp. 1291. See 

Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination and Postponement of Final Determination; Color Negative Photographic
Paper and Chemical Components Thereof from Japan,

 59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994, for an explanation of this tax methodology.


Foreign Market Value


In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that
the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used AST's sales to its home market customers and CV,
as described below.


Cost of Production


In order to determine whether home market prices were below the COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act,
we calculated COP based on the sum of AST's cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses and home market packing
costs. We compared individual home market prices net of inland freight and commission with model-specific COPs.
We performed a product-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below that
product's COP. The Department defines COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory
overhead, general expenses, and packing. For each product, we compared this sum to the home market unit price, net
of movement expenses and commission. In accordance with section 733(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home
market sales of each product were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period
of time, and whether such sales were made at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period
of time in the normal course of trade.
For each product where less than ten percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POI were made at prices
below the COP, we included all sales of that model for the computation of FMV. For each product where ten percent of more,
but less than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POI were prices below the COP, we excluded from the calculation
of FMV those home market sales which were prices below the COP, provided that the below-cost sales of that product were
made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were at prices below
the COP, and such sales were over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that product and calculated
FMV based on CV, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act.
In order to determine whether below-cost sales had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number
of months in which below-cost sales occurred for each product to the number of months in the POI in which that product
was sold. If a product was sold in fewer than three months during the POI, we did not exclude sales unless there were below
cost sales in each month of sale. If a product was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales
unless there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POI.
If sales below cost occurred in three or more months of the POI, they are considered to be made over an extended period
of time. When items are sold in just two or three months of the POI, we would consider below cost sales of these items to
be over an extended period of time, if they occurred in at least two months of the three months. When items are sold in
just one month of the POI, we would consider any below cost sales of these items to be over an extended period of time.

AST provided no indication that the disregarded sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within
a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. (

See, 

Section 773(b)(2); 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(2)).


Constructed Value


We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit.
In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we: 1) included the greater of AST's reported general
expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; 2) for profit,
we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses.


Price-to-Price Comparisons


For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on ex-factory or delivered prices, inclusive of packing
to home market customers. From these prices, we deducted commission, where appropriate. We deducted home market
packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. We also made adjustments,
where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section
773(a)(1) of the Act.
In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States, 

13 F. 3d 398 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV
pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we adjust for those expenses under
the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR
353.56(b)(2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges
from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market
inland freight.
For both price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where
appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). For U.S. sales with unreported
payment dates, we based AST's credit expense on the average number of days outstanding between shipment and payment
for AST's U.S. sales with reported payment dates. For a discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this
investigation, please see 

Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman 

(September 26, 1994) on file in room B-099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1),
we added U.S. indirect selling expenses as an offset to the home market commission, but capped this addition by the
amount of the home market commission.
We adjusted for a consumption tax collected in the Thai home market. (

the United States Price section of this notice, above.)

Currency Conversion


We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.


Verification


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination.


Suspension of Liquidation


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice,
that are produced and sold by AST and that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.
The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:




Adjustment of Deposit Rate for Countervailing Duties


Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``[no] product . . .
shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or
export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Since antidumping duties
cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash
deposit or bond for that amount.
Accordingly, the level of export subsidies as determined in the most recent administrative review of the countervailing
duty order, 

Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Thailand; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review,

 (57 FR 5248, February 13, 1992), which was 0.74 percent, will be subtracted from the margin for cash deposit or bonding
purposes. This results in a deposit rate of 9.63 percent for AST. We did not determine an ``all others'' rate in this
investigation, because all other producers and exporters of butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand are already subject
to an antidumpting duty order on this merchandise, which was published in the 

Federal Register 

on July 6, 1992 (57 FR 29702). 


ITC Notification


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.


Public Comment


Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) the party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of the issues to be discussed.
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary no later than November 16, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 23, 1994. A hearing,

Fair Value Comparisons


To determine whether BKL's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United
States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. BKL's sales for export to the Untied States and in its home market involved
both identical and similar merchandise. For those U.S. sales compared to a sale of similar merchandise in the home
market, we made an adjustment, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.57, for physical differences in merchandise. For certain products,
respondent did not provide the information necessary to make a comparison with the most similar merchandise based
on the model-matching criteria contained in Appendix V. As those sales accounted for a very small percentage of total
sales of subject merchandise, they have been disregarded in calculating our preliminary margin.


United States Price


We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, where the subject merchandise was sold
to an unrelated purchaser in the United States before importation and where the use of exporter's sales price (``ESP'')
methodology was not otherwise indicated.
We calculated purchase price based on packed, c.i.f. import prices to an unrelated customer in the United States.
We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight
and marine insurance, U.S. duty and brokerage.
Where sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation of the subject merchandise into the United
States, we based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. Almost all of the ESP sales of subject merchandise
were reported as further manufactured in the United States.
For ESP sales we made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts, foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight,
ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. brokerage and handling. In addition, for
ESP sales only, we deducted credit expense, indirect selling expense, inventory carrying costs, and commissions
to an unrelated agent. For certain ESP sales where respondent did not provide paydates, we used the average number
of credit days in calculating credit expense.
We made an adjustment to U.S. price for value-added tax (``VAT'') assessed on comparison sales in the U.K. in accordance
with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (``CIT'') decision in 

Federal-Mogul, et al. 

v. 

United States

, 834 F. Supp. 1391. See 

Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Color Negative Photographic Paper and Chemical Components from Japan

 (59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994), for an explanation of this methodology.
For pipe fittings that were further manufactured in the United States, we deducted all value added in the United States,
pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act. The value added consists of the cost of fabrication and general expenses
associated with the further manufacturing operations, as well as a proportional amount of profit or loss attributable
to the further manufacture. We calculated profit or loss by deducting from the sales price of the further manufactured
merchandise the related production costs and selling expense incurred by the company in both the U.K. and the United
States. We then allocated total profit or loss proportionately to all components of cost. We included only the profit
or loss allocated to the further manufacturing portion of total cost in our calculation of value added. Additionally,
we adjusted general and administrative (G&A) expenses from an allocation based on weight to an allocation based
on cost of sales.

Where respondent did not provide further manufacturing costs for certain products, we disregarded sales of those
products in our preliminary margin calculation.



Foreign Market Value



In order to determine whether BKL had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as the basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject
merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market
was viable. 

We calculated FMV based on both f.o.b. plant and delivered prices inclusive of packing, to customers in the U.K. In
light of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States

, 13 F. 3d 398 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight.

We deducted rebates, where appropriate, on home market sales. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S.
packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. In addition, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments
for differences in credit charges between the two markets, pursuant to CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating home market
credit expense, we used the weighted-average interest rate paid by respondent on short-term borrowings denominated
in British pounds. In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the weighted-average interest rate paid by respondent
on short-term dollar borrowings. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation,
please see 

Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman

 (September 26, 1994) on file in room B-099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we deducted home market indirect selling expenses as an offset to the U.S.
commissions, but capped this deduction by the amount of the ESP commissions and indirect selling expenses. We adjusted
for VAT in accordance with our practice (

see

 ``United States Price'' section of this notice.)



Cost of Production



Petitioner alleged that BKL made home market sales during the POI at prices below its cost of production (``COP'').
Based on petitioner's allegations and after examining the evidence on the record, we concluded that we had reasonable
grounds to ``believe or suspect'' that sales were made below COP. Thus, we initiated a COP investigation pursuant
to section 773(b) of the Act.

We performed a product-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below that
product's COP. The Department defines COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory
overhead, general expenses, and packing expense, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.51(c). (

See, e.g., Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet,
and Strip From the Republic of Korea

 (59 FR 35098, 35099, July 8, 1994).) We compared the COP for each product to the home market unit price, net of rebates,
movement expenses, and indirect expenses. We relied on submitted COP information except for the calculation of financing
expense. The submitted calculation was based on the combination of the financial statements of BKL and its parent
company without taking into account elimination of intercompany transactions. Therefore, we recalculated financing
expense using the parent company financial statements only.

In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home market sales of each product were made
at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were made
at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. 

To satisfy the requirement of 773(b)(1) that below cost sales be disregarded only if made in substantial quantities,
the following methodology was used. For each product where less than ten percent, by quantity, of the home market sales
during the POI were made at prices below the COP, we included all sales of that model for the computation of FMV. For each
product where ten percent or more, but less than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POI were priced below
the COP, we excluded from the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the COP, provided that
the below-cost sales of that product were made over an extended period of time. Where we found that more than 90 percent
of respondent's sales were at prices below the COP, and such sales were over an extended period of time, we disregarded
all sales of that product and calculated FMV based on CV. 

In order to determine whether below-cost sales had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number
of months in which below-cost sales occurred for each product to the number of months in the POI in which that product
was sold. If a product was sold in fewer than three months during the POI, we did not exclude sales unless there were below
cost sales in each month of sale. If a product was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales
unless there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POI. (

See Preliminary Results and Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews: Tapered Roller Bearings,
Four Inches or Less in Outside Diameter, and Components Thereof, From Japan

 (58 FR 69336, 69338, December 30, 1993).)



Constructed Value



For those products without an adequate number of sales at prices equal to or greater than the COP, we based FMV on constructed
value (``CV''), pursuant to section 773(b)(2) of the Act. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials,
fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit, in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii)
of the Act. We relied on submitted CV information except for the calculation of financing expense, which we recalculated
as described in the ``Cost of Production'' section of this notice. We included in our calculation of CV: (1) the greater
of BKL's general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (``COM''), as appropriate,
and; (2) for profit, the greater of BKL's profit or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general
expenses. 



Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 



Critical Circumstances



Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the
U.K. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe
or suspect that critical circumstances exist if: 

(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of this investigation, or 

(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and 

(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Regarding (A)(ii) above, we normally consider margins of 15 percent or more for exporter's sales price sales, and
margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price sales sufficient to input knowledge of dumping. If the U.S. price is
based on both PP and ESP, we normally weight-average the 25 percent and 15 percent benchmarks by the volume of PP and
ESP sales to arrive at a weighted-average benchmark percentage for imputing the knowledge of dumping (

see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products
From Argentina

 (58 FR 37078, July 9, 1993)).

The calculated preliminary margin in this investigation indicates that importers of pipe fittings should have known
that the merchandise was being sold at less than fair value.

Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16 (f), we generally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have been
massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and
(3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports.

If imports during the period immediately following the filing of the petition increase by at least 15 percent over
imports during a comparable period immediately proceeding the filing of a petition, we normally consider them massive
pursuant to section 353.16(f)(2) of the Department's regulations.

In order to determine whether imports have been massive over a relatively short period of time, we compared BKL's reported
shipments of butt-weld pipe fittings to the United States in the seven months after the petition was filed to the seven
months immediately before this period. Our analysis showed that the volume of imports of subject merchandise to the
United States by BKL had increased by more than 15 percent. (

See

 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2).) Based on this analysis, we determine that imports of butt-weld pipe fittings from the U.K. were
massive over a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, as the criteria enumerated in section 733(e)(1) of the
Act are met, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances exist for imports of butt-weld pipe fittings
from the U.K.



Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of butt-weld pipe fittings from the U.K., as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice,
that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date 90 days prior to publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated preliminary weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:

 Notice, Request for public comments. 

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is to advise the public that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has received a request
from the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) to have its recreational craft certification program
recognized under the NIST National Voluntary Conformity Assessment System Evaluation (NVCASE) Program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The U.S. boating industry manufactures more than 50% of all recreational boats sold throughout the world, a considerable
portion of which are sold in the European market. In order to continue to sell in the European Union (EU) market, the
U.S. recreational boat manufacturing industry will soon be required to satisfy new regulatory requirements established
under EU Directive 94/25/EEC relating to recreation craft. Manufactures will also be required to attest to the conformity
of their products with the requirements. The NMMA operates a program to certify that recreational boats, boating
accessories and components meet specified requirements. If its certification operations are accredited by NIST
under the NVCASE program, NMMA will be able to provide the required certifications and thereby facilities exports
of U.S. products to the EU market. 



the NVCASE procedures at 15 CFR Part 286 require NIST to seek public consultation when it receives requests for evaluation.
This notice therefore is a solicitation for comments on the NMMA request. Contingent upon the comments received,
NIST will schedule a public workshop to define general and specific criteria for conducting the requested evaluation.

The letter from the NMMA follows:



July 14, 1994.



Mr. Robert L. Gladhill, 


Manager, NVCASE Program, Admin A629, NIST Gaithersburg, MD 20899



Dear Bob: We hereby submit to you our formal request to have the NMMA certification program recognized by your NVCASE
program. As you know we have been one of your earliest supporters and as early as 1991 the U.S. Coast Guard supported
our efforts in a letter to NIST.

This has become especially urgent now because a Directive related to recreational craft has been adopted by the EC
in Europe with an implementation date of June 1996. This Directive refers to both the completed boat and components,
which the boat manufacturer usually orders a year before his next model year. Thus a boat manufacturer would place
his orders for engines and other components at the trade shows in October of 1994. He would then commence building the
boats during 1995 for the 1996 models which must comply with the Directive.

The NMMA certification is for recreational craft, the Directive is specifically for craft from 2.5 to 24 meters length.
The US Coast Guard has the responsibility for the safety aspect of these products. This certification would be limited
to product certification, in the Directive referred to as modules Aa and B+C, and thus would entail conformity assessment.
At this time we do not plan on getting involved in the quality assessment. NMMA is a member of the Recreational Marine
Agreement Group recently recognized by the EOTC, whose members follow the same procedures for product certification.
There are some 30 ISO standards related to small craft that will be used for this certification. These ISO standards
are in various stages of becoming adopted by CEN in Europe.

Recreational craft has been established as a top priority item for the Mutual Recognition Agreement discussion between
US and EC. These discussions have been conducted with the anticipation of NMMA being accredited by NVCASE. Further,
the USCG communication of 1991 suggested that NMMA become accredited by your program. Of additional importance is
the short time schedule for accreditation so components can be certificated by the end of this year.

If we were to go via any other organization, it is highly unlikely NMMA would get the needed accreditation in time. The
US presently has a positive balance of trade in this industry, but if we do not have our products in place, when this Directive
goes into effect, we will have a severe setback, which may affect the US boat manufacturer's profitability and possibly
employment.

The NMMA certificates 75-80% of all boats sold in the US. Many of the manufacturers of these boats rely on export
to be profitable. The participating manufacturers would probably be over 200 initially.

We request that you proceed with the accreditation level for NMMA as a product certification body as soon as possible.
Please let us know if there is any help we can provide.



  Sincerely,


<SIGNER>

Issuing a directive to the Commissioner of Customs charging illegal transshipments to a 1994 limit.




</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




Based on investigations conducted by the Government of the United States, CITA has determined that cotton sheets
in Category 361 were transshipped in circumvention of the U.S.-Pakistan Bilateral Cotton, Man-Made Fiber, Silk
Blend and Other Vegetable Fiber Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated May 20, 1987 and June 11, 1987,
as amended and extended. 

The United States Government requested consultations in writing with the Government of Pakistan on April 19. The
U.S. Government and the Government of Pakistan met on June 16, 17 and 20 and August 1, 2, 10 and 11 in Washington to discuss
the charges. The U.S. Government provided the Government of Pakistan with clear evidence of transshipment during
these meeting. The U.S. Government informed the Government of Pakistan of the charges to be made to the 1994 quota for
Category 361. Accordingly, in the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs
to charge 63,912 numbers to the 1994 quota level for Category 361.

U.S. Customs continues to conduct other investigations of such transshipments of textiles produced in Pakistan
and exported to the United States. The charges resulting from these investigations will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


The U.S. Government is taking this action pursuant a Memorandum of Understanding dated January 21, 1994 between the
Governments of the United States and Pakistan and the current bilateral U.S.-Pakistan bilateral textile agreement,
and in conformity with Paragraph 16 of the Protocol of Extension and Article 8 of the Arrangement Regarding International
Trade in Textiles, done at Geneva on December 20, 1973 and extended on December 14, 1977, December 22, 1981, July 31,
1986, July 31, 1991, December 9, 1992 and December 9, 1993.

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces will meet in closed session on October 11 and 12, 1994.


The Commission is charged with providing an independent review of the roles and missions of the armed services to Congress,
the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The year-long review will identify changes
that can be made to improve military effectiveness and eliminate unnecessary duplication among the services. At
this meeting, the Commission will review the national security strategy and discuss long-range national security
planning. Material to be presented and discussed will consist of both classified and unclassified information in
a format that makes it impractical to separate the two.
In accordance with section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92-453, as amended (5 U.S.C.
App II), it has been determined that this Commission on Roles and Missions meeting concerns matters listed in 5 U.S.C.
552b(c)(1), and that, accordingly, this meeting will be closed to the public.
Extraordinary circumstances created by coordination difficulties compel notice of this meeting to be posted in
less than the 15-day requirement.

<DOCTITLE>Intent to Prepare a Draft Supplement to the Columbia and Lower Willamette River Environmental Impact Statement,
July 1975</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft Supplement to the Columbia and Lower Willamette River Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS), July 1975. The original EIS addressed impacts of operational and maintenance dredging, and completion of
the 40-foot navigation channel downstream from Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. This Supplement is
being prepared to address the impacts to physical, biological, and cultural elements of the environment as a result
of current dredging practices and the potential effects of management alternatives that will be developed in the
Dredged Material Management Study (DMMS) for the Columbia and Lower Willamette Rivers.



The proposed action is to perform a management study (DMMS) that will identify and recommend alternatives for modifications
to the existing Operations and Maintenance dredging program and potential new proposals, such as pile dike construction
and other measures that are directed at reducing the frequency or quality of dredging.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Columbia and Lower Willamette River (C&LW) 40-foot navigation project is maintained by the Corps of Engineers.
Between four and seven million cubic yards of sand are dredged from the Columbia River portion of the project annually.
In addition, 500-750 thousand cubic yards of silty sand and sandy silts are dredged from the Lower Willamette
River on a three to five-year interval.


Between 1988 and 1991, the Corps of Engineers completed development of a Long-Term Management Strategy (LTMS) for
the portion of the channel that traverses the Columbia River Estuary, River Miles 3-28. A series of 50-year plan
scenarios were developed.

In October 1993, the Corps of Engineers was directed to undertake a dredged material management study (DMMS) for the
entire C&LW project. The DMMS study will also be coordinated with the Columbia River Channel Deepening Feasibility
Study effort. While intended to produce a stand alone document, the DMMS will, in part, also fulfill the requirements
to define the without project condition for the Feasibility Study. The study will be similar to the lower estuary LTMS,
in terms of process, but will follow the newer guidance for planning horizon, scope of study, etc. Dredged material
management issues on the Columbia River that are new since completion of the LTMS will be fully developed in the DMMS
for both the estuary and the remainder of the project. Most notable among new issues is the listing of three salmon stocks
which migrate through the project area as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

The scoping process commenced in July 1994 with the issuance of a scoping letter. Federal, state and local agencies,
Indian tribes, and interested organizations and individuals were asked to comment on the scope of the SEIS. Potentially
significant issues to be addressed in the SEIS will be based on effects of management alternatives and subsequent
actions thereof.



Potential effects on:

 wetlands and vegetation, wildlife habitat and populations, fisheries in the Columbia and Willamette Rivers (including
Snake River salmon), and cultural resources, will be studied.

Other environmental review and consultation requirements which will be addressed in conjunction with the DSEIS
include:

a. Clean Water Act of 1977, as amended.

b. Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.

c. Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended.

d. Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.

e. Cultural Resources Act.

f. Marine Projection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972.

g. Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management.

h. Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands.

i. Analysis of Prime or Unique Farmlands.

A formal scoping meeting has not been scheduled, however, comments are currently being received and the DSEIS is scheduled
to be made available to the public in July 1997.

Rocky Flats Seismic and Systems Safety



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; recommendation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has made a recommendation to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
2286a concerning Rocky Flats seismic and systems safety. The Board requests public comments on this recommendation.



</SUMMARY>
<SIGNER>
John T. Conway,

</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Chairman. 


[Recommendation 94-3] 


Rocky Flats Seismic and Systems Safety 


Dated: September 26, 1994.



In its Recommendation 90-5, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) recommended that a site-wide
Systematic Evaluation Program be conducted at the Rocky Flats Plant (now the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology
Site), to determine if safety upgrades should be instituted to enable the defense nuclear buildings and facilities
to meet current safety requirements. The mission of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site has changed since
the issuance of Recommendation 90-5, and the Implementation Plan for the Recommendation has been revised to
more directly address the current mission of the Site. 

The Board has been informed in briefings by the Department of Energy (DOE) that Building 371 is considered to be structurally
the best on-site facility for the storage of plutonium, and that steps are therefore scheduled that in time will move
the major part of the Site's plutonium inventory into storage in this building. As a result, Building 371 will assume
a unique role as the storehouse which contains the largest single accumulation of plutonium in the DOE complex. It
follows that potential health and safety issues associated with this proposed use of the building also assume very
high importance. 

Accordingly, the Board has been reviewing potential public health and safety issues at Building 371, and in particular,
the building's capacity to provide reasonable assurance of protection of public health and safety should it be subjected
to external forces from natural phenomena (earthquakes, extreme winds, and floods). The Board has observed that
DOE's ongoing studies in the Systematic Evaluation Program to better identify the potential hazards from natural
phenomena at Building 371 and to establish means of protecting against them are not well integrated. An effective
systematic Evaluation Program requires a more thorough application of the systems engineering process. The Board
has concluded that activities currently underway in this respect, to prepare Building 371 for its extended role in
storage of plutonium, are not logically structured and are not sufficiently encompassing in either detail or scope
to assure that the health and safety of the public will be adequately protected. 

Therefore, the Board recommends: 

1. That an Integrated Program Plan be formulated to address the civil-structural-seismic safety issues and evaluations
related to the planned use of Building 371 for storage of plutonium and related functions. This plan needs to be founded
on the principles of systems engineering and realistic schedules. Several studies, pertinent to such a plan, are
geologic fault investigations, groundmotion studies, dynamic building analyses, and soil-structure interaction
analyses. These studies and other elements need to be combined with the building mission and any other functional
criteria using systems engineering principles to develop the Integrated Program Plan. 

2. That the above plan address and explain any requirements for changes to the current Safety Analysis Report and how
such changes will be accomplished. This includes effects from earthquakes, extreme winds, and floods. 

3. That a comprehensive document be completed describing in detail the structural analysis methodology and standards
for the building analysis. This includes explaining analytical methods used and their applicability to the configuration
of Building 371. 

4. That the integrated program plan use both deterministic and probabilistic methods to establish the vibratory
groundmotion criteria that will be used in the structural evaluation of Building 371. This includes a rationale for
reconciling differences between the two methods. Moreover, these criteria should incorporate the results of a carefully
planned and executed site geological faulting investigations.

The proposed delivery point will be located on Texas Gas's Herbert-Cannellton 8-inch pipeline at Mile Post 3+1662
near Weberstown in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, and will be known as the Weberstown Delivery Point. 
Texas Gas states that the Weberstown Delivery Point will enable Western to render natural gas service for residential
heating in the community of Weberstown. 
Texas Gas states that the Weberstown Delivery Point is actually a ``reclassification'' of an existing ``farm tap''.
Texas Gas states that it will not be necessary for Texas Gas to construct any new facilities or modify any existing facilities
at this location. Texas Gas states that Western will replace the two meters it currently owns and operates at this location
with a single larger meter to accommodate both the existing service rendered at this ``farm tap'' and the projected
requirements for the Weberstown community. 
Texas Gas states that service to this new delivery point will be accomplished within Western's existing contract
quantities as set forth in Western's Firm Transportation Agreement-Zone 3 with Texas Gas and its Firm No Notice Transportation
Agreement with Texas Gas. Texas Gas further states that since no increase in contract quantities has been requested
by Western, the above proposal can be accomplished without detriment to Texas Gas's other customers. 
The estimated maximum annual quantity of natural gas to be delivered to Western at this point will be 2,500 MMBtu, with
a proposed maximum daily quantity of 10.5 MMBtu.

Take notice that on September 26, 1994, PetroCorp Incorporated (PetroCorp), 16800 Greenspoint Park Drive, Suite
300, North Atrium, Houston, Texas 77060-2391, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-804-000,
requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be constructed in Montezuma County, Colorado to be called
the Anasazi Gathering System (Anasazi) would have the primary function of gathering natural gas and would thereby
be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set
forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

PetroCorp states that it and other operators have discovered a new gas producing area in the Paradox Basin, Montezuma
County, Colorado. PetroCorp indicates that it has proposed the construction of a gathering system from three existing
wells in this area, plus other wells which are expected to be drilled, to connect with the gathering system of Western
Gas Resources, Inc. (Western) in San Juan County, New Mexico. It is stated that the gas would be transported through
Western's system to connect with the transmission facilities of El Paso Natural Gas Company. 


In support of its request, PetroCorp points out how the facilities meet the primary function test set out in 

Farmland Industries, Inc., 

23 FERC   61,063 (1983), as later modified. 



Length and Diameter of the Line 


PetroCorp points out that the Anasazi Gathering System will consist of 22.2 miles of 41/2 inch pipe. It is also indicated
that, as additional wells are completed, additional lateral 41/2 inch pipelines will be built. 



Central Point in the Field and Geographic Configuration



PetroCorp states that the boundaries of the field are not yet defined. PetroCorp indicates that it plans to build a
trunkline or spine across the producing area, constructing lateral pipelines as necessary to connect new producing
wells as they are drilled. PetroCorp states that the field has no central point, but is configured similarly to the
system in Amerada Hess Corporation, Docket No. CP91-1314-003, which it indicates the Commission determined
to be gathering in an order issued on May 27, 1994. 



Location of Compressors and Processing Plants



PetroCorp states that temporary portable compressor facilities will be installed at each well until the total number
of wells to be served by the system is determined. It is indicated that at that time an appropriate permanent compression
unit would be located on the gathering system at an appropriate downstream point. PetroCorp states that no processing
plant is contemplated. PetroCorp points out, however, that, if sufficient liquid and liquefiable hydrocarbons
are contained in the gas stream to make their extraction economically attractive, a processing plant may be constructed
at a downstream point. 




Location of Wells and Operating Pressure of the Line



PetroCorp states that a number of wells are located along the proposed spine. It is also indicated that the operating
pressure of the proposed system will be approximately 100 psig at the wellhead and approximately 400 psig at the delivery
point to Western.

Pacific Gas Transmission Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings


September 28, 1994.



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission:



1. Pacific Gas Transmission Company


[Docket No. CP93-618-002]



Take notice that on September 26, 1994, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT), 160 Spear Street, San Francisco,
California, 94105-1570, filed an Amendment to its Application in Docket Nos. CP93-618-000 and
001. In this proceeding, PGT is requesting a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity under Section 7(c) of
the Natural Gas Act, and Part 157, Subpart A of the Commission's Regulations. PGT seeks to construct and operate two
extensions of its mainline facilities_the Coyote Springs Extension and the Medford Extension. These extensions
would be used to provide firm transportation service to Portland General Electric Company (Portland General) and
WP Natural Gas, a division of The Washington Water Power Company (Wash. Water), respectively. PGT proposes to recover
the incremental cost-of-service of the respective extensions through surcharges to its existing FTS-1 Rate
Schedule. In this amendment, PGT details the specific surcharge rate treatment for the volumes to be shipped by Portland
General and Wash. Water over the two proposed extensions. PGT's proposal is more fully set forth in the application
and amendments which are on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Specifically, PGT requests approval of a deferred cost recovery mechanism for part of Wash. Water's service on the
Medford Extension. PGT states that the deferred mechanism does not alter the proposed incremental rate structure
for service on the proposed extensions. PGT also states that the deferred mechanism is designed to permit Wash. Water
to remain competitive with competing electric rates in its service area, and afford PGT an opportunity to recover
the life cycle cost-of-service for the service for Wash. Water's on a deferred basis. PGT proposes to file annual reports
containing the adjusted Wash. Water rate and related information on any deferred balance. 

Lastly, PGT proposes to recover the cost of extensions based upon a straight-line depreciation schedule which is
equal to the length of the transportation agreements for each extension. For service to Portland General over the
Coyote Springs Extension, the term of the contract is 20 years. For service to Wash. Water over the Medford Extension
the, the term of the contracts is 30 years, (there are two contracts between PGT and Wash. Water).



Comment date: 

October 14, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

 Notice of availability of the model State programs for the training and certification of operators of high capacity
fossil fuel-fired plants as required under section 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action announces the availability of training materials which constitute the model State training program
for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants, and the model State certification program for these operators,
as required under section 129 of the Act.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following outline is provided to aid in locating information in this notice.

 

I. Background 
II. Comments and Responses 
III. Model State Training Program 
IV. Model State Certification Program 
V. Authority 



I. Background 



Section 129(d) of the Act requires the EPA to develop and promote a model State program for the training and certification
of solid waste incineration unit operators and high-capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators. In August 1993,
the EPA submitted to all State air pollution control agencies the model State training programs that the EPA developed
for operators of municipal waste combustors (MWC's) and medical waste incinerators (MWI's) pursuant to this requirement.
To ensure the availability of at least one appropriate national certification program for these solid waste incineration
units, the EPA requested the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) to develop and manage a nationwide certification
program for MWC and MWI operators. As a result, the ASME developed an ASME certification program for each of these solid
waste incineration industry categories.
 
The model State training programs for MWC's and MWI's were developed by the EPA to provide a level of understanding
that is adequate to successfully complete the requirements of the ASME program or an equivalent State-approved program
for certification of operators of such facilities. The emission standards (40 CFR 60.50a) promulgated under section
129 for MWC's require certification of the operator by the ASME or an equivalent State-approved certification program.


In October 1992, the EPA initiated development of a training program for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired
plants. The EPA considers the term high-capacity fossil fuel-fired plants to mean boilers (i.e., devices that combust
fossil fuel to produce steam or hot water) greater than 10 million BTU's per hour heat input. The group of high capacity
fossil fuel-fired plants (boilers) covered in this training course includes the size range from small industrial,
commercial, and institutional steam generating units (greater than 10 million BTU's per hour heat input) to large
utility boilers.
 
On October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52106), EPA announced the availability of a draft student handbook, prepared as part of a training
course for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants, and EPA's intention to develop a model State certification
program for these operators; and invited public comments on both the contents of the student handbook and the EPA's
intention to develop the model State certification program.

II. Comments and Responses



Thirty-eight comment letters were received in response to the notice of availability of the draft student handbook
and EPA's intention to develop model State training and certification programs: twenty-three from utility companies,
seven from industrial boiler facilities, six from trade or technical associations, and two from government agencies.
The comments pertained to either specific items or statements in the draft student handbook, the need for the model
State training and certification programs, or the coverage of these programs. The comments specific to the draft
student handbook have been incorporated into the revised student handbook. The more significant issues raised by
commenters relating to the overall model training and certification programs along with clarification of the EPA's
intention for these model State programs are discussed below: 



1. Draft Student Handbook



A general comment on the draft student handbook was that it covers a wide range of facilities (i.e., fuel types, sizes
and applications) and that even though the handbook is a relatively comprehensive treatment of basic combustion
theory, technology and emission control, the level of understanding of each of these areas required by a plant operator
will vary with the size, type and fuel requirements of a facility. The commenters suggested that a modular handbook
be developed so training programs could reflect the specific equipment and fuel used at a facility. They further commented
that emphasis on the specific areas of training to reflect the organizational structure of the facility should be
allowed. 

In response, the training course developed by the EPA is modular in design. It is divided into 30 learning sessions.
Each session covers a specific area of knowledge, such as, pulverized coal-fired boilers, NO

 control technology, continuous emissions monitoring, etc * * *. The training course was designed
in this manner so that it may fulfill requirements leading to boiler operator certification. The information presented
in the training materials covers areas which may be addressed in a potential certification examination. Depending
on the different classes/levels of certification available, the appropriate training sessions for that particular
level of certification could be selected from the training materials to address the topics covered in that particular
certification examination. 



2. Requirement for Operator Training and Certification



Based on the comments received, there appears to be a general misunderstanding that, in the October 6, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice, the EPA was proposing to require the training and certification of operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired
plants. Some commenters stated that the October 6 

Federal Register

 notice failed to clearly state that the draft training program being presented in the form of the draft student handbook
was not being required for boiler operators under EPA regulations. 

For clarification purposes, section 129 (d) of the Act requires that the EPA develop a model State training and certification
program for both operators of solid waste incineration units and high capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators
but mandates training only for operators of solid waste incineration units. This notice announces the availability
of the model State programs for the training and certification of operators, as required by section 129 of the Act.
This notice is not a rulemaking action to require anyone to implement any training program. The individual States
may make determinations whether or not to require operator training and certification and may also decide whether
the EPA's model training program or another training program is appropriate. 



3. Need for Training and Certification Programs



Both utility and industrial facility commenters questioned the need for training and certification requirements
since their operators already undergo extensive site specific training programs that cover all of the topics listed
as chapters in the draft student handbook. The utility industry commented that because of the high skill levels required
for safe, efficient and reliable operation, extensive and comprehensive internal training programs have been implemented.
Both groups commented that their training programs should be allowed to satisfy the obligation for training and that
the EPA should allow any company to conduct a training course/program in lieu of the EPA or equivalent State program,
provided it meets the fundamental EPA requirements. Also, the utility industry commented that utility facilities
are subject to the Title V Operating Permit program under 40 CFR Part 70 and the Continuous Emission Monitoring rules
under 40 CFR Part 75 and therefore the utility industry believes that compliance with these regulations encompasses
all the objectives outlined by the EPA for training and certifying operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants.
They recommended that EPA include in its final model State program a provision for allowing compliance with the above
regulations to be considered equivalent to meeting the requirements of an operator training and certification program
and allowing the substitution of existing utility or industrial boiler training programs for the EPA model training
program to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.

In response and as stated above, under section 129 of the Act, the EPA is mandated only to develop model State training
and certification programs for operators of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants. These model programs will be
made available to the States for their use. The EPA agrees that a mechanism should be included in any State rules regarding
training and certification to allow facilities to satisfactorily demonstrate the equivalency of their program.
With regard to certification, this is similar to the provision included in the EPA regulations for MWC units where
EPA allows certification by ASME or an equivalent State-approved certification program.


4. Applicability


Many comments dealt with the coverage of the training and certification programs. These comments included:
a. They questioned the EPA's interpretation of high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants as inclusive of boilers with
relatively small capacity (i.e., as low as 10 million Btu per hour heat input). These commenters suggested that the
EPA target training for operators of boilers with 100 million Btu per hour heat input or greater. They commented that
many of the boilers in the 10 to 100 million Btu per hour range operate automatically with little attention, without
air pollution control equipment and do not incorporate operator adjustment features that could adversely affect
air pollution, and are mostly fueled by gas or light oil. Adjustments to these boilers are made on an annual or twice
per year basis by qualified outside contractors that specialize in boiler controls and adjustments. The commenters
further indicated that the narrow range of adjustments that an operator could make on a gas-fired boiler less than
100 million Btu per hour has a minor influence on emissions and that NO

X

 emissions are determined primarily by design factors such as configuration of the combustion chamber and the burner
design. Neither of these are under control of the operator.
b. A provision should be included in the final model State program to allow for acceptance of alternative training
and certification programs for facilities with low capacity factors. The EPA should include an exemption for training
for those units with annual capacity factors less than 15%. The required definition of high capacity fossil fuel-fired
plants would not be altered if such an exemption were provided for these units.
c. Many commenters believe that the training and certification requirement was intended to apply only to units subject
to Subparts Da, Db, and Dc.


* * * * *


In response to the above, the range of boiler sizes selected by the EPA for inclusion in the model State training program
was based on the range of boiler sizes covered by the various existing EPA emission regulations for steam generating
units. These emission regulations cover the size range from 10 million Btu per hour heat input and greater.
Potential air pollution problems can result from poor operation and maintenance of a boiler and associated air pollution
control system when operators do not understand the combustion and air pollution control processes and are inadequately
trained. The EPA feels that the training of boiler operators, regardless of the size or capacity factor, would result
in improved operation, be relatively inexpensive and would reduce emissions.
The reference made to Subparts Da, Db, and Dc in the October 6, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice was intended only to give the reader an indication of the types and sizes of the boilers that were selected for
discussion in the training course. Subparts Da, Db, and Dc list definitions for various aspects covered in the training
materials, such as, fossil fuel, electric utility steam generating unit, heat input, fluidized bed combustion,
etc. The reference to Subparts Da, Db, and Dc was not to suggest that the training course was only intended for operators
of boilers subject to these subparts. The training course was designed to be appropriate for operators of any boiler
with a capacity above 10 million Btu per hour heat input.


III. Model State Training Program


The training program developed for boiler operators is intended to provide the operator with a basic understanding
of the principles of fuel combustion and air pollution control and to identify good operating practices. The program
is intended to supplement rather than substitute for site-specific ``hands-on'' training of the operator. The objectives
of the training program are: to instruct operators in the basic principles of proper operation and maintenance of
boilers and air pollution control systems; to help assure that the boiler is continuously operated in a manner which
complies with State and Federal regulations; to enhance the operators appreciation for their role in minimizing
air pollution; and to increase the operators awareness of regulatory requirements.

<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00050 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The training materials consist of a student handbook which is not only intended for use during the course but also may
be used as a reference by the operators after completion of the course, and an instructor guide which provides the basic
materials for use by the instructor of the training course. The instructor's guide includes the course description
and agenda, course goals, lesson plans, copies of an initial test and a final course examination, and audio-visual
aids.
Activities for developing this training course performed since mailout of the draft student handbook include revision
of the student handbook based on comments received from the mailout, development of the instructor's guide, a trial
run of the course, revision of the training materials based on comments received from the trial run, and publication
of the final student handbook.
The trial run of the training materials was conducted in April 1994. The trial run presented the course materials and
obtained comments from participants concerning areas that could be changed to improve the course materials. Among
the twenty-eight attendees were operators, training specialists, and supervisors of utility and industrial facilities.
Also in attendance were representatives from boiler insurance, inspection, and licensing organizations. Comments
received from the trial course were incorporated into the final student handbook, as appropriate. The chapters which
required the most significant revisions were those pertaining to the water and steam circuits, package boilers,
and safety. Also, the materials presented in the chapters on combustion principles and air pollution fundamentals
were simplified without compromising the material content. The instructor's guide was then modified to reflect
changes to the student handbook.
The operator training materials include testing materials that indicate a student's satisfactory completion of
the training course. The EPA will provide the final student and instructor manuals to the States so they can use them
to implement an operator training program for high capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators.

IV. Model State Certification Program



In the development of any operator certification program, several key factors must be addressed. Among these factors
is which personnel should be required to be certified. The EPA believes certification should not be limited to only
the operator with hands-on control of the boiler. These operators may lack the authority to request the assistance
of a repairman when equipment needs maintenance or service. Also these operators may not be authorized to take corrective
action in the event of equipment malfunction. Such authority may rest with the operator's supervisor. This may be
a shift supervisor, chief engineer, plant manager, etc. It is the operator's supervisor who is usually responsible
for making critical decisions regarding operation and maintenance of the equipment. Because decisions made by the
operator's supervisor are key to proper operation of the boiler, the operator's supervisor must have a broader level
of understanding than the operator. Thus, there is a need for separate levels of certification for operators and operator
supervisors. 
In addition, the level of knowledge needed by an operator or operator supervisor is dictated by the complexity of the
equipment operated. For example, the knowledge required to operate a coal-fired boiler with an air pollution control
system is greater than that required to operate a gas-fired boiler without an air pollution control system. It may
not be reasonable to require an operator of a boiler without an air pollution control system to demonstrate knowledge
of such equipment. Therefore, several classes of boiler operator certification should probably be developed for
each operator certification level. 
Furthermore, since, as the commenters have indicated, many boilers may operate with little or no operator attention,
any certification program should consider including those individuals who perform the boiler tuning and maintenance.

Another key area concerns the qualifications that an applicant should possess for certification. An acceptable
level of skill and operating ability should be demonstrated on a boiler system which is equivalent to (or higher than)
the class of boiler for which certification is being sought. This ``hands-on'' ability could be demonstrated by an
on-site examination by a qualified/certified examiner or demonstration of ability before other certified operators
who verify the applicant's ability. Also a consideration is the prior experience needed before applying for certification.
The certification program should require some prior experience under the direct supervision of a certified operator/operator
supervisor who verifies the proficiency of the applicant. Finally, an applicant should be required to successfully
pass a written examination covering the areas of knowledge deemed necessary for the particular class/level of certification
being sought. The written examination could be administered by the State or some authorized certification organization.

The EPA's intention, announced in the October 6, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice, for developing a model State certification program for high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants is to outline
the scope and components that a State agency should include in a certification program. Components that should be
considered for inclusion in any State developed or approved certification program are: 


1. Coverage of the Certification Program.



Determination of the type and size of boilers for which operator certification is appropriate. Boilers for which
environmental regulations apply are candidates for inclusion in any certification program. 


2. Level of Operators To Be Certified


The duties and responsibilities of the positions of the operator and operator supervisor should be established for
the purpose of identifying facility personnel to whom certification applies at fossil fuel-fired plants. Certification
for all persons who have control over the process and can affect process emissions should be included. This may include
operators, supervisors, maintenance personnel, and outside contractor personnel. 
An operator is generally in direct control of the operation of a boiler system and is responsible for the startup, operation,
and shutdown of equipment. Typical responsibilities may include the following: 
a. Operating equipment in accordance with established practices and procedures; 
b. Operating equipment consistent with applicable federal, state, and local government requirements; 
c. Identifying and initiating responses to upsets and emergency conditions; 
d. Identifying and communicating the need for equipment repairs and maintenance; 
e. Communicating with management when system operation is in noncompliance with applicable regulations; 
f. Operating in a safe manner; 
g. Recording operational data as required. 
An operator supervisor generally has direct responsibility for the operation of a boiler system and is responsible
for overall on-site supervision, technical direction, management, and performance of the facility. Typical responsibilities
may include the following: 
a. Supervising, training, monitoring, and evaluating operators; 
b. Assuring operation in accordance with established practices and procedures; 
c. Assuring equipment is operated in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local government requirements;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00050 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

d. Directing action to correct equipment upsets or emergency conditions; 
e. Assuring operating and maintenance records are maintained and reports are prepared as required; 
f. Assuring noncompliance incidents and corrective action items are reported to management or regulatory agencies;

g. Assuring a safe workplace. 
The operator supervisor may also directly perform the duties and responsibilities of the operator. 


3. Classes of Certification


This includes establishment of various classes for which operator certification is appropriate. The level of knowledge
needed to properly operate and minimize emissions varies considerably depending on the type of facilities. Therefore,
the level of knowledge will vary depending on job duties and responsibilities. Different classes of certification
within each level developed under (2) should be considered. 
A boiler system may have any combination of fuel type, boiler type and air pollution control system, and an operator
should be certified in the class designation equivalent to or more comprehensive than the type of equipment operated.

Example operator class designations are:



Class A - certified to operate a coal-fired boiler with air pollution control systems 
Class B - certified to operate a coal-fired boiler without air pollution control systems 
Class C - certified to operate a gas or oil-fired boiler with air pollution control systems 
Class D - certified to operate a gas or oil-fired boiler without air pollution control systems 


4. Qualifications


The following are the recommended qualifications that should be met by an operator/operator supervisor to complete
certification: 
a. Minimum age requirement; 
b. Training; 
c. Minimum level of experience under the direct supervision of a certified operator or operator supervisor who must
verify the proficiency of the applicant in all aspects of the job; 
d. Pass a written examination, as discussed in item 5 below, administrated by the State or a State-approved certification
organization. 
The acceptable demonstration of skills and ability should be performed on a boiler system equivalent to, or higher
than, the class of boiler equipment for which certification is being sought.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00050 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

During the initial implementation of a certification program when there are not certified operators or operator
supervisors available to certify the applicant's proficiency, the applicant's employer could be allowed to verify
that the applicant has been continuously employed as either an operator or operator supervisor for a minimum period
of time and that the applicant's job performance has been satisfactory. Further, the employer should verify that
the hands-on experience was as an operator or operator supervisor for a boiler system equivalent to, or higher than,
the class of boiler equipment for which certification is being sought.



5. Training Requirements



The training requirements should be established for boiler operators to provide the operator with a basic understanding
of the principles of fuel combustion and air pollution control and to identify good operating practices. The training
requirements should included both classroom and site-specific ``hands-on'' training of the operator. The objectives
of the training program are: to instruct operators in the basic principles of proper operation and maintenance of
boilers and air pollution control systems; to help assure that the boiler is continuously operated in a manner which
complies with State and Federal regulations; to enhance the operators appreciation for their role in minimizing
air pollution; and to increase the operators awareness of regulatory requirements.



6. Pass Written Examination



The final key element should be a requirement that the applicant demonstrate sufficient knowledge in specified areas
by passing a written examination administered by the State or an approved certification organization. This element
should also require a provision for a ``bank'' of questions to implement the written examination to assure that tests
given at different times are not identical.

The examination should be structured as a closed book, multiple choice, and written examination. The examinations
for operators should differ from those for operator supervisor consistent with the differences in duties. The examination
could be modular in design and given in parts. Candidates successfully passing the appropriate parts can be deemed
to have completed the written testing requirements for a particular certification class.

To successfully pass a test part, a candidate should correctly answer a minimum of 70 percent of the questions in that
part.

Questions should be related to:




a. Water and Steam Circuit

b. Fuel, Air and Gas Circuit

c. Basic Combustion Principles

d. Air Pollution Fundamentals

e. Boiler equipment characteristics

f. Normal Boiler Operation

g. Automatic Control Systems

h. Instrumentation

i. Preventative Maintenance

j. Safety

k. Air Pollutants of Concern

l. Environmental Regulations

m. Continuous Emissions Monitoring

n. Particulate Control

o. NO

X

 Control

p. SO

X

 Control

q. Water Pollution and Control

r. Solids Waste and Control



7. Issuance of Certification



Each candidate who passes the written examination and whose proficiency has been verified should be issued a certificate
valid for a specific time period (e.g., five years). Each certificate should contain the following minimum information:




a. Type of certification;

b. Certified individual's full name;

c. Photograph of certified individual;

d. Effective date and expiration date.

e. Signature of a duly authorized designee.



8. Provision for Recertification





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00050 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Certification should be granted for a limited period of time. The procedure for recertification could be simply verification
of satisfactory employment with the appropriate type of equipment for that certification level/classes since the
time the previous certification was granted or it could entail additional refresher courses, ``hands-on'' demonstration,
or passing of a written examination.



9. Revocation of Certification



There should be a procedure included in the certification program to revoke a certification for falsifying or providing
inaccurate information in the certification process.

The components listed above as the model State certification program are modelled after the certification standards
developed by the ASME for MWC and MWI operators. These ASME certification standards were developed by a committee
balanced by interest classification (e.g., regulatory, operators, manufacturers, etc.) and underwent public
review and comment. The EPA was a member of the ASME committee for the development of the MWI certification standard.

In August 1992, to ensure the availability of at least one appropriate national certification program, the EPA requested
the ASME to develop and manage a nationwide certification program for boiler operators. As a result, the ASME Board
of Safety Codes & Standards and the Council on Codes & Standards approved the formation of a committee in June
1994 to develop such a program. The ASME certification program is anticipated to be completed in late 1996.

As discussed above, the EPA will provide the final student handbook and instructor guide, developed by the EPA, to
the States so they may implement operator training or certification programs prior to finalization of the ASME certification
program. In addition, some States may already require that boiler operators obtain state boiler operator engineer
licenses. If these licensing agencies demonstrate equivalency, a State air pollution control agency could accept
this licensing as certification under this program. Licensing organizations, such as the National Institute for
the Uniform Licensing of Power Engineers Incorporated, have commented that there are other licensing organizations
that may be able to provide certification programs in a shorter timeframe than the ASME since they already have a licensing
program developed for boiler operators along with a possible database of appropriate questions. They also indicated
a willingness to modify their programs to meet whatever criteria a State sets for a certification program.

As stated in the October 6, 1993 

Federal Register

, the training materials developed by the EPA will be revised as necessary when the ASME certification program is sufficiently
developed to ensure that the training course is coordinated with the certification requirements.

The ASME has previously developed certification programs for operators of MWC's and MWI's. In terms of the boiler
operator certification, the EPA's intention is to continue to work with the ASME by serving on the various development
committees and by providing technical assistance to develop a certification program. The ASME certification program
is anticipated to be completed no earlier than late 1996.



V. Authority



This notice of availability of model State programs for the training and certification of operators of high capacity
fossil fuel-fired plants is issued under the authority of section 129 of the Clean Air Act, as amended.

<DOCTITLE>Science Advisory Board Notification of Public Advisory Committee Meeting(s) Open Meeting(s) </DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92-463, notice is hereby given that several committees
of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) will meet on the dates and times described below. All times noted are Eastern Time.
Documents that are the subject of SAB reviews are normally available from the originating EPA office and are not available
from the SAB Office. 



(1) Clean Air Act Compliance Analysis Council (CAACAC) Physical Effects Review Subcommittee (CAACACPERS) Teleconference_October
18, 1994: 



The Clean Air Act Compliance Analysis Council (CAACAC) Physical Effects Review Subcommittee (CAACACPERS) of the
Science Advisory Board (SAB) will conduct a teleconference meeting on Tuesday, October 18, 1994 from 11:00 a.m. to
1:00 p.m. eastern time. In this teleconference meeting, the CAACACPERS intends to discuss six draft documents which
have been prepared for review as required by Section 812 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), to be briefed by Agency staff on the
overall Physical Effects review process, and to plan for an efficient review scheduled for November 15 and 16, 1994
to be held in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (See below for details on the November 15 and 16, 1994 meeting).


In the teleconference, the CAACACPERS will be discussing how the review will take place, provide initial observations
regarding the first review drafts of the Physical Effects Documents pertaining Section 812 of the Clean Air Act (CAA),
namely (1) Ozone, (2) Sulphur Oxides, (3) Particulate Matter, (4) Carbon Monoxide, (5) Nitrogen Oxides, and (6) Lead,
and plan for an upcoming November two-day review meeting. The Agency is preparing a draft methodology document for
review by the SAB's CAACACPERS, which outlines the overall strategy of this effort. This methodology document is
still under preparation, and may be made available prior to the teleconference. Additional draft documents, such
as the methodology used to aggregate the effect of hazardous air pollutants, up-to-date assessments of the significance
of recent research, and possibly select methodology papers may be provided in the future for review as necessary and
appropriate. The Agency has asked the SAB to answer the following questions in the proposed charge relating to this
review: 

(1) Are each of the elements of the methodology developed by EPA sufficiently valid and reliable from a scientific
standpoint for purposes of the CAA Section 812 assessments?, 
(2) The Congress and EPA intend that the CAA Section 812 retrospective analysis should provide the most comprehensive
possible statement about potential benefits of historical reductions in air pollution. This includes reporting
on the potential significance of effects for which there may be no scientific consensus regarding the magnitude or
even the existence of a specific effect. Given this statutory and administrative goal, is the methodology developed
by EPA sufficiently comprehensive in terms of plausible health, welfare, and ecological consequences of exposure
to the relevant air pollutant?, 

(3) If the answer to question 2 is negative, what are the physical outcomes of pollutant exposure which the Agency has
omitted?, 

(4) For physical outcomes already included in the methodology paper, as well as those which should be considered for
inclusion pursuant to question 2, are there potentially relevant data pertaining to quantitative or qualitative
estimation of the effect which should be considered for inclusion in the methodology? What specifically are the sources
of these data and how might they be best utilized?, and 

(5) What is the strength of the scientific evidence underlying each of the physical effects functions or models already
included in the methodology paper? What is the strength of each element of additional scientific evidence suggested
for inclusion pursuant to question 3 and 4 above? 

For copies of the Agency's draft Section 812 draft documents, please contact Ms. Eileen Pritchard, Secretary, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Policy Planning and Evaluation (OPPE), Economic Analysis and Innovation
Division (Mail Code 2127), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Tel. (202) 260-3354, and FAX (202) 260-5732.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Becker Microbial Products Inc., to conditionally
register the pesticide products BMP 123 (48 LC), BMP 123 (2X WP), and BMP 123 (32 LC) containing a new active ingredient
not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 18, 1993 (58 FR 8945), which announced that Becker Microbial Products Inc., 9596 N.W. 11th St., Plantation,
FL 33322, had submitted three applications to conditionally register the pesticide products BMP 123 (48 LC), BMP
123 (2X WP), and BMP 123 (32 LC) (File Symbols 62637-A, 62637-L, and 62637-U),~ containing the active
ingredient 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 at 2.15, 6.4, and 1.60 percent respectively, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products.
The company later amended the name of the active ingredient to read ``

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 strain BMP 123.''

~~~~~~~~~

The applications ~were approved on August 5, 1993, which contain the active ingredient 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 strain BMP 123 for terrestrial, forestry, and food use to control various insects, for the following products: 

1. BMP 123 (48 LC) (EPA Registration Number 62637-6).
2. BMP 123 (2X WP) (EPA Registration Number 62637-5).
3. BMP 123 (32 LC) (EPA Registration Number 62637-4).

A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do
not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration
period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 strain BMP 123, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically,
the Agency has considered the nature and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of
potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which
show that use of 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 strain BMP 123 during the period of conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the
environment, and that use of the pesticide is, in the public interest. 

These products are conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C) provided that the studies
be submitted by December 21, 1994, as listed below: 
1. Avain Oral (Guideline Reference Number 154A-16).
2. A 30-Day Freshwater Fish Toxicity/Pathogenicicty Testing (154A-19).
3. Freshwater Aquatic Invertebrate Toxicity/Pathogenicity Testing (154A-20).
4. Honey Bee Toxicity/Pathogenicity Test (154A-24).
5. Analysis of Samples (154A-13).
If these conditions are not complied with the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA
section 6(e); this registration will expire on May 21, 1996.

Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 

More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

subspecies 

kurstaki

 strain BMP 123. 
A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 

In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703-305-5805).
Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed

 In the Third Report and Order in the Expanded Interconnection proceeding, CC Docket No. 91-141, the Commission
required Tier 1 local exchange carriers (LECs), except National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) pool members,
to offer certain signalling information to interested parties so that those parties could provide tandem switching
services. The Commission ruled that LECs offering of the necessary signalling information will constitute a new
service under price caps. LECs are required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test. This
will enable the Commission to ensure that the required signalling information is reasonably priced. In addition,
LECs will be required to establish a rate element for the signalling information as a separate service category within
the trunking basket. Tier 1 LECs are required to file tariffs for offering signalling information for traffic from
their equal access end offices.

present their views in person or in writing on the strengths and weaknesses of the way the PHS and institutions pursue
such allegations. On the second day, the Commission will continue its discussion of specific issues in scientific
misconduct and the responsible conduct of research. 

The mandate of the Commission is to develop recommendations for the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
Congress on the administration of Section 493 of the PHS Act, as amended by and added to, by Section 161 of the NIH Revitalization
Act of 1993. Discussion items may include but will not be limited to the issues noted above.

Commission members will prepare questions to guide witnesses in their presentations. The questions should be obtained
from the Executive Secretary. More detailed statements from witnesses on their individual experiences may be submitted
in writing to the Executive Secretary before or at the meeting. Each statement will be reviewed by Commission Members.
Witnesses and members of the public are advised that in both written or oral statements presented to the Commission,
they should not reveal any confidential information from any open case under investigation by an institution or the
Office of Research Integrity or from any closed case where there has not been a finding of scientific misconduct or
which has not otherwise been made public.

<DOCTITLE>Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies and
Laboratories That Have Withdrawn From the Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS (Formerly: National Institute on Drug Abuse, ADAMHA,
HHS).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines.



If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Pub. L. 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine
Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine
drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance
testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in a quarterly
performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections.



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 

not 

to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards.

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice sets forth summaries of the proposed United States negotiating positions on agenda items and resolutions
for the ninth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP9) to the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 
Comments or other relevant information concerning these proposed

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an 
international treaty designed to control international trade in certain 
animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with 
extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the treaty. Currently, 123 
countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for 
biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties which review its 
implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat (in 
Switzerland) to carry out its functions, consider amending the list of 
species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the 
Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the 
Convention.

This is part of a series of notices which, together with public meetings, 
provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the development of 
the U.S. positions for the ninth regular meeting of the Conference of the 
Parties (COP9) to CITES. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on July 15, 
1993 (58 FR 38112), requested information and comments from the public on 
animal or plant species the United States might consider as possible 
amendments to the Appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on 
November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60873), requested public comments on possible 
revisions to the criteria for listing species in the CITES Appendices. A 


Federal Register

 notice published on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832), 
requested additional comments from the public on animal or plant species 
the United States was considering submitting as amendments to the 
Appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4096): (1) published the time and place for COP9; (2) announced a public

meeting for February 22, 1994, to discuss the 31st meeting of the CITES 
Standing Committee; (3) detailed the provisional agenda of the COP; and (4) 
requested information and comments from the public on possible COP9 agenda 
items and resolutions that the United States might submit. A 

Federal 
Register 

notice published on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45307), announced a 
public meeting to take place on September 14, 1994. A 

Federal Register

 
notice published on September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46023), set forth summaries of 
proposed U.S. negotiating positions on species proposals that were 
submitted by other countries to amend the CITES Appendices and requested 
public comment on these proposals. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on September 7, 1994 (59 FR 46266), announced an additional public meeting to 
take place on September 16, 1994. The present notice complements the 
previous notices by setting forth proposed U.S. negotiating positions on 
other agenda items and resolutions for COP9, and requests public comments 
on these positions, which were also presented at the September 14 and 16 
public meetings. Another 

Federal Register

 notice will also announce the 
proposed species amendments, resolutions, and agenda topics submitted by 
the United States. The Service's regulations governing this public process 
are found in Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations   23.31-23.39. 




Proposed Negotiating Positions 



In this notice, the Service summarizes proposed negotiating positions on 
agenda items and resolutions for COP9 (other than proposals to amend the 
Appendices, which are presented in the September 6, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice discussed above). Numerals next to each agenda item correspond to the numbers used in the provisional agenda
[COP9 Document 9.1 (revised)] received from the CITES Secretariat. However, documents for a number of the agenda
items have not yet been received from the CITES Secretariat; they will be available on request from the Service after
they have been received. 


A list of documents received to date were made available at the public 
meetings of September 14 and 16, 1994, and copies will be made available to 
the public on request. When information and comments on the agenda items 
were submitted in writing to the Service or received at the February 22, 
1994 public meeting, they are included with the proposed negotiating 
position. Each proposed position includes a brief rationale explaining the 
basis of the position. The Service will endeavor to publish a 

Federal 
Register 

notice in October 1994 that details final negotiating positions on 
all issues pertaining to COP9, with the understanding that new information 
that becomes available during discussions at a COP can often lead to 
modifications in these positions. At COP9, the U.S. delegation will fully 
disclose all position changes and rationale explaining them. 



AGENDA (Provisional) 




I. Opening Ceremony by the Authorities of the United States of America 




The United States is arranging for a suitable ceremony in cooperation with 
the CITES Secretariat. Details of the ceremony will not be finalized until 
October, 1994. 



II. Welcoming Addresses 




The United States is arranging for welcoming addresses from appropriate 
officials in cooperation with the CITES Secretariat. 




III. Adoption of the Rules of Procedure 


See Doc. 9.1 (Rev)_Provisional Agenda for COP9 




Oppose modifications to the Rules of Procedure; support retention of the 
Rules of Procedure from COP8 in Kyoto, Japan.

<TEXT>
 

The Provisional Rules of Procedure have been circulated by the CITES 
Secretariat to the Parties. The Rules of Procedure must be adopted by the 
Plenary of the COP at the outset. The only difference between the Rules of 
Procedure for COP8 and the Provisional Rules circulated by the Secretariat 
are in Rule 15, paragraph 3, which was modified by the Standing Committee 
at its thirty-first meeting in Geneva, 21-25 March 1994. The modifications 
recommended by the Standing Committee, and indeed all of the Rules of 
Procedure, are not official until they are adopted by the COP. Rule 15, 
paragraph 3, refers to secret ballots. According to the Rules of Procedure 
adopted at COP8 (which did not differ from those at COP7), when a 
delegation proposes that a vote be taken by secret ballot, an open vote is 
required to approve this proposal; a majority of all Parties voting must 
approve a secret ballot before it is implemented. The revised Rules of 
Procedure recommended by the Standing Committee, amended at the suggestion 
of the observer from Zimbabwe at that meeting, require that only six 
parties (the proposer and five seconds) request a secret ballot for it to 
be implemented for a particular vote. 

At the Standing Committee meeting, the United States delegation opposed 
modifying the Rules of Procedure. The proposed COP9 position of the United 
States remains in opposition to this modification of the Rules of 
Procedure, which operated effectively at both COP7 and COP8. In numerous 
international fora (e.g., GATT, UNCED), it has been the position of the 
United States to promote openness in the dealings of intergovernmental 
organizations. The United States believes that since a delegation at a COP 
is accountable to its government, it should not need to vote in secret. 

The United States is also very concerned that making secret ballots too 
easy will unnecessarily delay the work of the COP. The United States also 
believes that it is inappropriate for the minority (possibly only six 
countries) to dictate to the majority how votes should proceed. The United 
States believes that a rule allowing a few countries to require use of the 
secret ballot could lead to excessive use of this option. Secret ballots 
are extremely slow and time consuming. For budgetary and other reasons, 
electronic voting cannot be provided at the COP, which would have minimized 
the time necessary to conduct a secret vote. Regardless of how few or many 
secret ballots are taken at the COP, however, all U.S. positions and votes 
on issues will be publicly disclosed. 



IV. Election of Chair and Vice-Chair of the Meeting and of Committees I 
and II and of the Budget Committee 


No documents will be prepared for this item. Support election of a 
Conference Chair from the United States, and highly qualified Committee and 
Vice Chairs representing the geographic diversity of CITES. 
The Chair of the CITES Standing Committee (New Zealand) will serve as 
temporary Chair of the Conference until a permanent Conference Chair is 
elected. It is traditional for the host country to provide the Conference 
Chair, and the United States will propose a person with substantial 
executive skills and international negotiating experience to be nominated 
as Chair. This person, if elected by the parties, will serve as Presiding 
Officer of the Conference and also of the Conference Bureau, the executive 
body which manages the business of the Conference; other members of the 
Bureau include the Committee Chairs (discussed below), the nine members of 
the Standing Committee (see Agenda Item IX), and the Secretariat. 
The major technical work of CITES is done in the Committees, and thus 
Committee chairs must have great technical knowledge and skill. In 
addition, CITES benefits from active participation and leadership of 
representatives of every region of the world. The United States will 
support election of Committee Chairs and Vice Chairs of the Conference 
having requisite technical knowledge and skills and also reflecting the 
geographic and cultural diversity of CITES. The United States is now 
consulting with the Secretariat and the Standing Committee regarding 
suitable candidates. 


V. Adoption of the Agenda and Working Programme 


See Doc. 9.1 (Rev)_Provisional Agenda for COP9; Doc. 9.2 (Rev)_ 
Provisional Working Programme for COP9; Doc. 9.2.1 (Rev)_Provisional 
Working Program for COP9 Committee I; and Doc. 9.2.2 (Rev)_Provisional 
Working Program for COP9 Committee II. Support adoption of an agenda and 
working program that guarantees a smoothly operating meeting that addresses 
all species and implementation issues; the U.S. nominee to serve as 
Conference Chair, if accepted by the parties, will be responsible for 
management of the overall agenda, in consultation with the Bureau.

VI. Establishment of the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
Support the establishment of the Credentials Committee and Committees I and II. 
Establishment of the Credentials Committee is a 

pro forma

 matter. The 
Credentials Committee approves the credentials of delegates to the COP, by 
confirming that they are official representatives of their government, 
thereby affording them the right to vote in Committee and Plenary sessions. 
The United States supports the establishment of Committees I and II, 
provided most participating Parties have been able to send at least two 
delegates, or that the rules governing debate of the Committees ensure that 
most delegations will have an opportunity to debate recommendations before 
a final decision is made. 


VII. Report of the Credentials Committee 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
Support adoption of the report of the Credentials Committee if it does not 
recommend the exclusion of legitimate representatives of countries that are 
Parties to CITES. Representatives whose credentials are not in order 
should be afforded observer status as provided for under Article XI. If 
credentials have been delayed, representatives should be allowed to vote on 
a provisional basis. A liberal interpretation of the Rules of Procedure on 
credentials should be adhered to in order to permit clearly legitimate 
representatives to participate. 
Adoption of the report is generally 

pro forma. 

Exclusion of Party 
representatives whose credentials are not in order could undermine 
essential cooperation among Parties. 


VIII. Admission of Observers 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
Support admission to the meeting of all technically qualified 
non-governmental organizations and oppose unreasonable limitations on their 
full participation at COP9. 
Non-governmental organizations representing a broad range of viewpoints and 
perspectives play an important role in CITES activities and have much to 
offer to the debates and negotiations at a COP. Their participation is 
specifically provided by Article XI of CITES. The United States supports 
the opportunity for all technically qualified observers to fully 
participate at COPs.

IX. Matters Related to the Standing Committee 


No documents have been received yet. This agenda item consists of three 
subitems: 
1. 

Report of the Chairman. 

The United States strongly supports the active 
role which the current Standing Committee, under the leadership of New 
Zealand, has played in carrying out the many functions given to it by 
resolutions adopted by Conferences of the Parties. This includes the 
review of compliance with these resolutions by the Parties and making 
decisions for appropriate action when Parties are not in compliance. 
2. 

Regional representation on the Standing Committee: 

Support an increase 
in Standing Committee membership if budgetary implications can be resolved. 
The Standing Committee is currently composed of six Regional voting 
representatives of North America (Canada), Central and South America and 
the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, the Vice Chair), Asia (Thailand), 
Oceania (New Zealand, the Chair), Africa (Senegal), and Europe (Sweden). 
There are also three 

ex officio, 

nonvoting members: Switzerland 
(depositary country), Japan (past host country), and the United States 
(current host country). Each CITES Region currently has one representative 
on the Standing Committee, regardless of how large or small the number of 
Parties (Africa has 43 CITES parties, for example, while North America has 
only 3 and Oceania only 4). A proposal submitted by Malawi but not yet 
actually reviewed would increase the number of Regional representatives 
from Regions having larger numbers of Parties. The United States will 
consider support for such proposals depending on their exact nature and 
only after full consideration by the Budget Committee of their financial 
effects. 
3. 

Election of new members and alternate regional members: 

Encourage 
membership which will continue the active role of the Standing Committee. 
The Regional representatives of North America, Europe, and Oceania are open 
for review by their respective Regions at COP9. The United States, as host 
of COP9, will continue on the Standing Committee as past host country until 
COP10. A new Chair will be selected by the new Standing Committee during a 
meeting to be held at the close of COP9; while the United States will not 
have a vote, the U.S. position is to encourage selection of a Chair with a 
strong commitment to a proactive Standing Committee role in the management 
of CITES affairs, as New Zealand has done during the past two years. 


X. Report of the Secretariat 


The Report of the Secretariat has not yet been received by the Service. 
When received, the Service will carefully review issues pertaining to: 
success of procedures for Parties to set budgetary and work priorities; 
setting of new short-term and long-term objectives for the Secretariat; 
evaluation of the performance of the Secretariat; and progress in assisting 
Parties to more forcefully implement the Convention. 
The biennial report provides the major way for the Secretariat, and the 
Secretary General, to report priorities, accomplishments, and problems to 
the Parties. These are critical management issues facing CITES which need 
to be addressed in the Secretariat's report. 


XI. Financing and budgeting of the Secretariat and of meetings of the 
Conference of the Parties 


1. Financial Report for 1992-1993 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. The United States continues to advocate fiscal 
responsibility and accountability. 


2. Anticipated expenditures for 1994 and 1995 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. The United States continues to advocate fiscal 
responsibility and accountability. 


3. Budget for 1996-1998 and Medium-term Plan for 1996-2000 


See Doc. 9.10_Budget Estimates for the CITES Trust Fund for 1996-1997 and 
for the Medium-term Plan for 1996-2000. This document was only received a 
short time ago by the Service, and is still undergoing review. 
Oppose any substantial increase in the Secretariat's budget representing a 
significant increase in its work plan. Support budget increases requested 
by the Secretariat in cases where the growing membership is placing 
increasing burdens on staff, without any commitment to an increased U.S. 
contribution. Support an evaluation of priorities and possible 
reprogramming of budget items into underfunded or unfunded areas of higher 
priority.

<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The United States cannot at present commit to a larger contribution to the 
CITES budget. The United States is the largest single contributor; under 
the United Nations scale, the United States is asked to provide 25 percent 
of the annual operating budget. In Fiscal Year 1994, Congress appropriated 
approximately $1 million to the Department of State for this purpose. 
However, the United States recognizes the heavier workload being imposed on 
the Secretariat, Standing Committee, and both the Animals and Plants 
Committees. 


4. External Funding 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 
External funding refers to the financial support by Party governments and 
non-governmental organizations for projects that have been approved by the 
Standing Committee. The CITES Parties have established a process whereby 
the Standing Committee approves projects and approves donors, to avoid even 
the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Secretariat's report on this 
issue is expected to summarize approved donors, approved projects, projects 
that have been funded, and approved projects that are awaiting funding. 
The Service, the Department of State, and the National Marine Fisheries 
Service have made substantial contributions to externally funded projects, 
including travel of delegates from developing countries to COPs, support 
for committee meetings, facilitating a meeting of the Working Group on the 
Transport of Live Specimens, biological studies of significantly traded 
species, review of national laws for the implementation of the Convention, 
numerous enforcement-related projects, and other similar projects. 


XII. Committee Reports and Recommendations 


1. Animals Committee 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. This agenda 
item has two subitems in the provisional agenda: 
(a) Report of the Chairman 
(b) Regional representation on the Animals Committee 
The United States supports the active role of the Animals Committee in 
scientific and management issues pertaining to animal species listed in the 
CITES Appendices. Encourage membership which will continue the active role 
of the Animals Committee, and selection of a Chair with a strong commitment 
to a proactive Animals Committee. 
The Animals Committee report may contain information or recommendations 
dealing with Appendix II species subject to significant trade, marking 
techniques, crocodilian tagging, sea turtle ranching, care for and 
reintroduction of seized live animals, and various other issues. The 
United States has actively participated in the work of the Animals 
Committee since COP8, and will continue to be an active participant in 
Animals Committee functions. 
The Animals Committee is currently composed of individuals representing the 
six CITES geographic regions: North America, Central and South America and 
the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Each CITES Region 
currently has one representative on the Animals Committee. The Regional 
representatives are selected by their respective regional caucuses, at the 
COP. A new Chair will be selected by the new Animals Committee, most 
likely during a meeting to be held at the close of COP9. 


2. Plants Committee 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. The United 
States supports the continued activities of the Plants Committee to improve 
the effectiveness of CITES for plants, with a focus on the following: 
publication of checklists and identification guides; significant trade in 
orchids, succulents, and other species; review of the timber trade; and 
trade in artificially propagated plants. Encourage membership which will 
continue the active role of the Plants Committee, and selection of a Chair 
with a strong commitment to a proactive Plants Committee.

<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00112 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Plants Committee is currently composed of individuals representing the 
six CITES geographic regions: North America, Central and South America and 
the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Each CITES Region 
currently has one representative on the Plants Committee. Dr. Bruce 
MacBryde of the Service's Office of Scientific Authority serves as Vice-Chair of the Plants Committee (representing
North America). The Regional 
representatives are selected by their respective regional caucuses, at the 
COP. A Chair will be selected by the new Plants Committee, most likely 
during a meeting to be held at the close of COP9. 


3. Identification Manual Committee 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
Continue to support the Identification Manual Committee and development of 
animal and plant identification manuals for use by port and border 
enforcement officers, in providing a standard of reference for the 
identification of CITES species, within available resources and priorities. 

The enforcement officers of the Parties must be equipped with guides which 
are accurate, realistic, and helpful in the identification of the many 
CITES species and products found in trade throughout the world. 


4. Nomenclature Committee 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. This agenda 
item has two subitems in the provisional agenda: 
(a) Report of the Chairman 
(b) Recommendations of the Committee 
Encourage the development and adoption of checklists for all taxa, within 
budgetary limits and priorities to be decided upon by the Parties. Support 
revisions of existing checklists for fauna prior to development of new 
ones. Because of the expense in developing checklists for taxa, the United 
States supports recognition of existing checklists for remaining taxa when 
suitable. Implementation of the Convention is strengthened by the use of 
uniform names of listed species. 
The Service understands that the report of the Chair presents technical 
nomenclatural corrections and recommended revisions to names included in 
the Appendices at the Plenipotentiary Conference and at COP1. Those 
revisions will require adoption by the Parties at COP9. 


XIII. Evolution of the Convention 


1. Strategic Plan of the Secretariat 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 


2. How To Improve the Effectiveness of the Convention 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 
This agenda item was suggested by the delegate from Canada at the March 
1994 Standing Committee meeting; the Standing Committee agreed that a 
review of the general evolution and implementation of CITES should by done 
by an independent body, and that a project proposal for this review should 
be developed by the Secretariat. The main concern of the United States is 
what funding will be available for such a project, and that it not impair 
the ability of other functions in the Secretariat budget to receive 
necessary funding. 


XIV. Interpretation and Implementation of the Convention 


1. Review of the Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties 


Support the effort begun by the Secretariat immediately following COP8, at 
the direction of the Standing Committee, to review all of the resolutions 
of the Conference of the Parties with the goal of assisting Parties in the 
effective utilization of the resolutions, in order to more effectively 
implement the Convention, by: (1) Deleting resolutions that have been 
superseded or whose purpose has been accomplished; and (2) consolidating 
resolutions that deal with the same subject. 
At every Standing Committee meeting since COP8, the United States 
delegation has strongly urged (and the Committee has adopted this 
recommendation of the United States) that any consolidation of resolutions 
retain the text of the original, including the preamble, so as to: (1) 
assist the Parties, while retaining the original intent of the resolution; 
and (2) reduce unnecessary or unproductive debate at COP9 on ``old'' issues. 
Therefore, the United States supports deleting only out-of-date resolutions 
that are truly non-controversial, and retaining the text of the original 
for any consolidations. The Standing Committee reiterated its support for 
this approach at its March 1994 meeting. The United States supports an 
expedited approval of these consolidations in Plenary Session at COP9, 
which will only be possible if the original text of resolutions (preamble 
and operative paragraphs) are retained, so that any consolidations will be 
structural and not substantive. 


(a) Deletion of Resolutions that are out of date. 

See Doc. 9.19.1_Deletion of Resolutions that are Out of Date. 
Support the deletion of resolutions that are out of date, if they have been 
superseded by other resolutions or have been overtaken by events. Likely 
to support the deletion of all resolutions proposed by the Secretariat and 
circulated to the Parties, with the following exceptions: Conf. 2.8, 3.13, 
and those relating to certain parts and derivatives of plants_Conf. 2.18, 
4.24, 6.18, and 8.17 (b) and (c). Certain other resolutions on plants 
remain pertinent unless they are superseded by new resolutions coming from 
COP9, e.g., Conf. 5.15 in relation to Doc. 9.30 on nursery registration.

Technical review of Doc. 9.19.1 will continue and the U.S. may offer 
further comment on the affected resolutions before or during the COP. 
The United States supports deletions of resolutions that are out of date or 
no longer relevant. However, recent discussions in the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC) highlight the fact that illegal trade in whale 
products continues, in spite of the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling. 
The United States has requested that this item be discussed at COP9 (see 
agenda item 15). The IWC has not yet completed an observation, inspection 
and enforcement program which would certify that the products of any 
commercial whaling which occurs in the future are taken in compliance with 
IWC regulations. Therefore, the admonitions contained in Resolutions Conf. 
2.8 and 3.13 appear to the United States to be as pertinent today as when 
they were adopted by the Parties. These resolutions are neither out of 
date, nor have they been superseded. Therefore, the United States opposes 
deletion of these resolutions. 
The United States opposes deletion of the aspects pertaining to plants in 
Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 6.18, and 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), which provide an important 
legal basis, which is different from using a limited departure from Conf. 
5.9 on what is readily recognizable, to guide the standard exclusion or 
exemption from CITES provisions of certain specified parts and derivatives 
of certain plants, e.g., the cut flowers of artificially propagated 
Appendix I hybrids and the flasked seedlings of all artificially propagated 
orchids. 
Future germane proposals on taxa for Appendix I simply can be directed by 
Conf. 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), without subsequent proposals on the standard 
exemptions. Future proposals to uplist orchid taxa thus would be routinely 
guided by Conf. 8.17(c) and their flasked seedlings would be exempt. A 
similar process has been in effect for the proposals on Appendix II plant 
taxa, where routinely certain parts or derivatives are standard exclusions, 
as specified through Conf. 4.24 (e.g., for tissue cultures) and Conf. 6.18 
(e.g., for flasked seedling cultures). 


(b) Consolidation of valid resolutions. 

No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, 
documents have been received at several Standing Committee meetings. The 
United States essentially supports those consolidations prepared thus far 
by the Secretariat; a review finds them to be a diligent and accurate 
consolidation of a complex array of resolutions dealing with the same 
subject. Proposed consolidations have been discussed at Standing Committee 
meetings and approved for transmission to the Parties on the following 
issues (final text has not yet been received from the Secretariat, 
however): Transport of live specimens (consolidate Conf. 3.16, 4.20, 5.18, 
7.13, and 8.12); Disposal of illegally traded specimens (consolidate Conf. 
2.15, 3.9, 3.14, 4.17, 4.18, 5.14, and 7.6); Trade in elephant ivory 
(consolidate Conf. 3.12, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, and 7.8); Annual reports 
and trade monitoring (consolidate Conf. 2.16, 3.10, 5.5, 5.6, 5.14, and 
8.7); Trade in readily recognizable parts and derivatives (consolidate 
Conf. 4.8, 5.9, 5.22, and 6.22); Permits and certificates (consolidate 
Conf. 3.6, 3.7, 4.9, 4.16, 5.7, 5.8, 5.15, 6.6, 8.5); Trade in plants (12 
prior resolutions: consolidate Conf. 2.13, 5.14, 5.15, 8.17, propose to 
repeal all or part of Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 5.14, 6.18, and 6.20, and deal with 
Conf. 2.14, 4.16, and parts of 5.14, 8.18, 8.19 in a separate 
consolidation); Trade with non-Parties and reserving Parties (consolidate 
Conf. 3.8, 8.8); and Transit and transhipment (consolidate Conf. 4.10, 
7.4). 


2. Establishment of a List of the Other Decisions of the Conference of 
the Parties 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. Support 
ongoing Standing Committee and Secretariat efforts to differentiate between 
Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties which provide guidance and 
interpretation of the Convention, or call for continuing activities of 
indefinite duration, and decisions of the COP that direct the Secretariat 
or permanent committees to perform certain specific activities of limited 
duration. 
The Standing Committee has recommended that decisions of the Parties at the 
COP be distributed in a manner similar to that for resolutions. The United 
States supports this procedure, utilizing guidelines to be adopted by the 
COP, that have been approved by the Standing Committee. Often, 
recommendations to the Secretariat or permanent committees are included in 
resolutions, when these recommendations are relevant for a particular 
committee only, or for a short time period between two COPs only. The 
United States supports separating these specific and/or short-term 
decisions from resolutions, wherein resolutions should refer to 
recommendations for implementation of the Convention, and interpretations 
of the Convention. 


3. Report on National Reports Under Article VIII, Paragraph 7, of the 
Convention 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
Support efforts to encourage all Parties to submit annual reports, for all 
species of flora and fauna, consistent with their domestic legislation. 
Support efforts whereby proposals for transfer of certain species from 
Appendix I to II with an export quota or pursuant to ranching only be 
considered for Parties that are current with their annual report 
submissions. 
Each Party is required by the Convention to submit an annual report 
containing a summary of the permits it has granted, and the types and 
numbers of specimens of species in the CITES Appendices that it has 
imported and exported. Accurate report data are essential to measure the 
impact of international trade on species, and can be a useful enforcement 
tool. 


4. Review of Alleged Infractions and Other Problems of Implementation of 
the Convention

See Doc. 9.22_Draft Infractions Report for COP9. 

Support the Secretariat's review of alleged infractions by the Parties, and 
necessary and appropriate recommendations to obtain wider compliance with 
the terms of the Convention. Support an open discussion at COP9 of major 
infractions, and a greater emphasis by the Parties on the enforcement of 
the laws and regulations implementing the Convention. 

Article XIII of the Convention provides for COP review of alleged 
infractions. The Secretariat prepares an Infractions Report for each COP, 
which details instances that the Convention is not being effectively 
implemented, or where trade is adversely affecting a species. The first 
draft of the Infractions Report contains numerous such alleged infractions. 
The United States has commented on the draft Infractions Report. A cursory 
review of the alleged infractions indicates a great difference in the depth 
of the reporting on infractions over previous reports. The United States 
considers this to be an excellent, well-researched and well-prepared 
Secretariat document. A large number of infractions are caused by lack of 
training, lack of personnel, or lack of knowledge on the workings of CITES. 
The majority of the alleged infractions should be a major cause of concern 
to the Parties. When the final Infractions Report (incorporating the 
comments of Parties) is circulated by the Secretariat, it will be available 
to the public upon request. 



5. Implementation of the Convention in the European Community 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

This issue was discussed extensively at COP8; absent any document, the 
United States cannot formulate a position at this time. 



6. National Laws for Implementation of the Convention 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

The United States was strongly supportive at COP8 of a review of national 
laws for the implementation of the Convention; such laws are required by 
Article VIII of the Convention. The Service provided funding for this 
project, and has already received reviews of national legislation for 
several countries. The United States believes that the Convention's 
effectiveness is undermined when Party states do not have national laws 
implementing the Convention, including laws and regulations that authorize 
seizure and/or forfeiture of specimens imported or exported in 
contravention of the Convention, and laws and regulations that provide 
appropriate penalties for such violations. 



7. Enforcement of the Convention 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no complete 
position is possible at this time. Support establishment of a Law 
Enforcement Network. 

Notification to the Parties number 776 asked the Parties for their comments 
on a proposal for establishment of a Law Enforcement Network. The United 
States supported establishment of such a network at that time, and 
continues to do so. The United States will continue its support for the 
provision of law enforcement training to assist Parties in implementing and 
enforcing the Convention. 

Nine Parties responded to Notification 776, which asked the Parties for 
their comments on the proposed Law Enforcement Network, as follows: five 
countries (Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States) supported the proposal; three countries (Belgium, France 
and Uruguay) opposed the proposal; and one country (Spain) was neutral. 
Although it was not adopted by the Standing Committee, it was agreed that 
the Parties should discuss the issue at the COP. The United States 
considers effective enforcement of the Convention to be a critical element 
that is lacking for many countries, for a number of reasons, including: 
lack of training, inadequate legislation or regulations, lack of funding, 
lack of infrastructure, and inadequate communications and networking with 
other countries and entities. The United States believes that establishment 
of a Law Enforcement Network, comparable to other committees or working 
groups established by the Parties, will begin the process of alleviating 
these deficiencies.

8. Trade in Hunting Trophies of Species Listed in Appendix I 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat. The United 
States continues to support implementation of Resolution Conf. 2.11 by all 
Parties. 



9. Exports of Leopard Hunting Trophies and Skins 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 

However, the United States opposes any increases in quotas without adequate 
supporting data. 

The Service does not know whether this document will involve only a report 
on exports, or whether it will be similar to Resolution Conf. 8.10, which 
refers to the trade in leopard skins, including hunting trophies, under a 
quota system approved by the COP. Trade in leopard skins for noncommercial 
purposes is allowed under CITES Resolution Conf. 8.10, which recognizes 
killing in defense of life and property and to enhance the survival of the 
species. 



10. Interpretation and Application of Quotas 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 



11. Trade in Specimens of Species Transferred to Appendix II Subject to 
Annual Export Quotas 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. In the past, this agenda item has involved a 
report noting compliance with provisions of quota systems. 



12. Trade in Rhinoceros Specimens 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

The United States continues to be an advocate for strong enforcement of the 
Convention, and use of all possible measures to encourage countries to 
effectively implement the Convention. The United States continues to 
support decisions of the Standing Committee that illegal trade in 
rhinoceros specimens undermines the effectiveness of CITES. 



13. Conservation of Rhinoceros in Asia and Africa 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

The United States continues to be supportive of efforts to benefit the 
conservation of rhinoceros species in Asia and Africa, while realizing that 
such conservation efforts are seriously undermined by any trade in 
rhinoceros specimens in contravention of the Convention. 



14. Trade in Tiger Specimens 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

The United States continues to be an advocate for strong enforcement of the 
Convention, and use of all possible measures to encourage countries to 
effectively implement the Convention. The United States continues to 
support decisions of the Standing Committee that illegal trade in tiger 
specimens undermines the effectiveness of CITES. The United States is also 
exploring the possibility of having a special evening program on tiger 
conservation during the Conference. 



15. Illegal Trade in Whale Meat 



The United States requested that this item be included on the agenda for 
COP9, and will submit a paper to the CITES Secretariat for transmission to 
the Parties prior to COP9. 

There was extensive discussion at the May, 1994 meeting in Mexico of the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) regarding illegal international 
trade in whale meat, including involvement by CITES Parties. All whales 
subject to the IWC moratorium on commercial harvest are listed in CITES 
Appendix I. A resolution was adopted by IWC (introduced by the United 
States and other Parties) on this topic, and the issue is discussed in the 
IWC Infractions Report. The Service submitted the information in the IWC 
Infractions Report on international trade in whale meat to the CITES 
Secretariat. The United States is concerned that illegal trade in whale 
meat undermines the effectiveness of CITES for whale species, and will 
submit a paper on this topic for discussion at COP9. Several IWC member 
countries raised concerns at the IWC meeting that it was inappropriate to 
discuss trade in whale specimens outside of CITES. While a CITES COP is 
the appropriate venue for such discussions, the U.S. paper will encourage 
IWC to continue to explore this issue, and to report on progress to both 
the CITES Standing Committee and COP10. 



16. Trade in Shark Products 



The United States requested that this item be included on the agenda for 
COP9, and will submit a paper to the CITES Secretariat for transmission to 
the Parties prior to COP9. The United States will request in that paper 
that this agenda item be renamed ``Trade in Shark Parts and Products'', in 
order to more accurately frame the debate. It is not the intent of that 
document to discuss shark management regimes, including catch quotas, 
minimum sizes, time and area closures, or gear restrictions. 

As was discussed in the January 27, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice, the 
United States considered whether or not to submit a proposal to COP9 to 
include several taxa (families or genera) of sharks in Appendix II. There 
is limited information about a recent increase in international trade in 
shark parts and products, particularly in fins for the food market. The 
United States considered there to be insufficient scientific and trade data 
on which to base a listing proposal. The United States believes that this 
is an important issue for the Parties to discuss. The United States is 
considering requesting that the Animals Committee be called upon to 
recommend methods and processes for assessing the biological and trade 
status of shark species in international trade. The paper that the United 
States will submit may request action by the Animals Committee. 

The intent of the United States in asking that this issue be discussed by 
the Conference of the Parties is twofold: (1) To encourage discussion of 
how best to collect data on international trade in shark parts and 
products, particularly how to document catches by species; and (2) to 
collect data that will provide the best information about the impact of 
international trade (including introduction from the sea) in shark parts 
and products on both shark populations and the ecosystems on which they 
depend. 



17. Trade in Plant Specimens 





(a) Nursery registration for artificially propagated Appendix I species.

 
See Doc. 9.30_Nursery Registration for Artificially Propagated Appendix I 
Species.

<TEXT>
 

Tentatively oppose the resolution establishing a stipulated registration 
system within the CITES Secretariat for plant nurseries artificially 
propagating specimens of species included in Appendix I. The United States 
supports a system that would improve the credibility of the existing system 
for determining which plant specimens are artificially propagated. 

The registration system proposed in this draft resolution is complex and 
would be costly to implement by many Parties. Furthermore, it may place 
too much of a burden with nurseries themselves in determining what 
constitutes artificially propagated specimens, and thereby be 
counterproductive. The current draft of this resolution is an improvement 
over previous versions, and the United States encourages the Secretariat to 
continue to make progress in this important area. 



(b) Revision of the consolidated Resolution.

 
No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 



(c) Standard reference for Orchidaceae.

 
No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. The United 
States supports continued work toward a standard reference for traded 
orchid species. 




(d) Implementation of the Convention for timber species.

 
No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 

However, the United States notes that the provisions of CITES apply to 

all

 species of wild fauna and flora, including tree species used as timber; some timber species are already listed in the
CITES Appendices. CITES' 
purview is in addition to the fact that the trade in timber species may 
come under the competence of another international treaty, convention, or 
agreement. 



(e) Ramin (Gonystylus bancanus).

 
No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 



18. Significant Trade in Appendix II Species 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 

However, the United States continues its long-standing support for the 
continued focus of the Parties on Appendix II species identified as subject 
to significant trade and the proper implementation of Article IV, as 
critical to the implementation of the treaty and species conservation. 
Support the provision of funding for the coordination and implementation of 
significant trade study projects, with oversight by the Animals, Plants, 
and Standing Committees. 

This topic refers to the trade in those Appendix II species identified as 
subject to significant trade, for which a review is necessary to determine 
if there exists sufficient biological information to warrant trade at 
current levels. Many of these species may have been traded at levels 
detrimental to their survival. The CITES Parties have provided funds to 
the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the Conservation Monitoring Centre 
to assess priorities in studying these species. The United States has 
provided funds for field projects involving several of these species. 

This process has worked effectively since COP8, with the implementation of 
Conf. 8.9. The Animals and Standing Committees have taken a very active 
role in this process, with net benefit for the conservation of some species 
and for improvements in the implementation of the Convention. The United 
States supports continuation of this process, for both animals and plants, 
with a high priority being placed on implementation of studies by Parties, 
scientific assessments, implementation of scientifically-based quotas when 
appropriate, and effective implementation of Article IV. 



19. Standardization of CITES Permits and Certificates 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position

20. Non-commercial Samples of Skins 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 



21. Marking of Crocodilian Specimens 



No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 

At COP8, the United States advocated adoption of a resolution that it 
submitted jointly with Australia, to require the skins of all crocodilian 
species to be tagged before being allowed to be traded by CITES Parties 
(whether or not a reservation has been entered by a Party). 

Resolution Conf. 8.14, submitted by both the United States and Australia, 
established the framework for a system of universal marking for all 
crocodilian skins in trade, as a response to serious problems of illegal 
trade in crocodilian skins, parts, and products. The Animals Committee was 
charged with setting up the system for the Parties. The Animals Committee 
has prepared a revision of Resolution Conf. 8.14 on this topic, due to 
problems with implementation of portions of the resolution. The draft 
resolution of the Animals Committee has not yet been received from the 
CITES Secretariat. 



22. Transport of Live Specimens 



Support the adoption by the COP of the report of the Chair of the Working 
Group on the Transport of Live Specimens (TWG). The United States will 
remain an active participant in the TWG, and with all aspects of the 
transport of live wild animals. 

Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Service's Office of Management Authority has 
served as Chair of the TWG since COP8. Copies of all reports of the Chair 
of the TWG to the Standing Committee are available on request, including 
the Terms of Reference of the TWG. The Chair submitted a report to the 
Standing Committee Chair and to the Secretariat, for transmission to the 
Parties and discussion at COP9. That report makes recommendations for the 
future of the TWG. The Service fully supports the report, and recommends 
its adoption, with the exception of reserving its position on adoption of 
budgetary and personal recommendations of the Chair contained therein. 
Those budgetary recommendations would facilitate increased training efforts 
and greater involvement of exporting Parties in TWG activities and 
deliberations, which the Service supports. The Service also supports the 
provision of time near the beginning of the first week of COP9 for those 
interested in the TWG to meet and discuss transport issues, prior to full 
discussion in Committee II. Several past participants in TWG activities 
have inquired as to whether such a meeting of the TWG would be possible; 
the Service believes that it would be in the best interest of CITES 
implementation and of the transport of live animals. 

The humane transport of live wild animals remains a significant concern of 
the United States. The TWG's Terms of Reference with the Standing 
Committee include working to improve implementation of the Convention and 
relevant resolutions, training, improvement of international standards, 
coordination with the International Air Transport Association Live Animals 
Board, and the transport of live wild birds. 



23. Implementation of Article XIV, Paragraphs 4 and 5 



Support adoption of the resolution submitted by the United States, which 
deals with the implementation of Article XIV, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the 
Convention. The U.S. goal in submitting this resolution is to clarify how 
an Appendix II listing could be implemented expeditiously for a marine 
species whose management is under the competency of a pre-existing treaty. 

The provisions of CITES apply to all species of wild fauna and flora, 
including marine species. The management of many marine species comes 
under the jurisdiction or competence of another international treaty, 
convention, or agreement. International trade in any species of marine 
fauna or flora is also within the purview and competence of CITES. 
Therefore, even if a marine species is subject to management under another 
international treaty, convention, or agreement, if it is listed in any 
CITES Appendix, international trade and introduction from the sea in the 
species is regulated by CITES. 

CITES made preparation for such situations when the treaty was written. 
Article XIV, paragraph 4, of the Convention provides that a State party to 
CITES, which is also a party to any other treaty, convention, or 
international agreement which was in force at the time of the coming into 
force of CITES and under the provisions of which protection is afforded to 
marine species included in Appendix II, is relieved of the obligations 
imposed on it under CITES with respect to trade in specimens included in 
Appendix II that are taken by ships registered in that State and in 
accordance with the provisions of such other treaty, convention, or 
international agreement. 

This relief from CITES obligations does not apply to specimens of species 
included in Appendix I. For example, several whale species are managed 
under the competence of the International Convention for the Regulation of 
Whaling, but all those species are listed in Appendix I. 

Currently no marine species whose management is under the competence of 
another treaty, convention, or agreement is listed in Appendix II. 
Therefore, this provision of the Convention in Article XIV has never been 
used, and standards for its implementation have not been developed. The 
United States has determined that it would be wise to plan for the need to 
implement Article XIV, by specifying requirements for certificates issued 
pursuant to Article XIV, paragraph 5, of the Convention, even if its use is 
not necessary at this time. The Service notes that Appendix II allows for 
international commercial trade. The resolution provides for the 
utilization as a valid certificate under Article XIV, paragraph 5, of a 
certificate of origin or statistical document issued on the authority of 
the other treaty, convention, or international agreement, with certain 
stipulations of minimum information and validation as required by CITES.

Such certificates are only an option for CITES Parties that are also 
parties to the other treaty, convention, or agreement. 


24. Disposal of Confiscated Live Animals 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 
This issue was discussed at the Animals Committee, and the Service believes that the Animals Committee prepared a
draft resolution that will be 
discussed at COP9. The Service has not yet received the final draft 
resolution prepared by the Animals Committee. However, the Service is 
supportive of uniform guidelines for the Parties on how to deal with 
confiscated live animals, that will benefit both the welfare of the 
individual animals and the conservation of their species in the wild. The 
Service is supportive of such guidelines, consistent with U.S. law. The 
Service is concerned about the risk of introduction of disease to wild 
populations from confiscated live animals being considered for 
reintroduction programs. The Service believes that transport and handling 
concerns for live animals should be coordinated with the Working Group on 
the Transport of Live Animals. 
Interest in what Parties should do with confiscated specimens, particularly live animals, goes back to the drafting
of the Convention. The re-export of Appendix II specimens does not require a Scientific Authority finding. The Parties
have spoken quite clearly on the issue of return of confiscated specimens to the country of origin, when feasible.



25. Disposal of Skins of Illegal Origin 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position 
is possible at this time. 


26. New Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II 


See Doc. 9.41_New Criteria for Amendment of Appendices I and II. 
Support adoption of the alternative Annexes submitted by the United States 
on this issue, rather than those prepared by the Standing Committee (as 
pertain to Annexes 1 and 2 of the draft resolution). The United States 
basically supports the other annexes of the Standing Committee resolution. 
The existing CITES listing criteria, known as the ``Berne Criteria'' 
(Resolutions Conf. 1.1 and 1.2) were developed at the first CITES 
Conference in 1976 in Berne, Switzerland. The United States agrees that 
the Convention will be strengthened by reevaluating the Berne Criteria for 
listing species in the Appendices, and that the Berne Criteria need to be 
reviewed and adapted to address a broader array of taxa and to be more 
descriptive and definitive, to the extent possible. At the same time, the 
United States notes that an inherent strength of CITES, which must be 
safeguarded, is its ability to seek balanced conservation-based solutions 
for a broad range of species and populations being considered. Thus, if 
any revision of the Berne Criteria is to be adopted at COP9, the United 
States is supportive of retaining maximal flexibility while firmly 
maintaining scientific credibility. 
The move to revise the Berne Criteria originated at the 1992 CITES 
Conference, in Japan (COP8). At COP8 the Parties agreed to start a 
process, coordinated by the Standing Committee, to develop a scientifically 
sound revision for consideration at COP9 in 1994. The World Conservation 
Union (IUCN) was asked to do a first draft, which would first be reviewed 
at a joint meeting of the Standing, Animals and Plants Committees, and put 
into CITES resolution form. The United States participated in a joint 
meeting of the Standing, Animals, and Plants Committees in Brussels in 
August-September 1993, which reviewed the IUCN draft and produced a draft 
resolution that was circulated to the Parties. 
The Service submitted comments to the Standing Committee, after 
consultation with other Federal agencies and reviewing extensive public 
comments received. The U.S. comments maintained that much of the draft 
resolution was not valid scientifically, and was not acceptable from 
management or practical perspectives. The United States believed that the 
criteria as proposed met neither the CITES treaty's requirements for the 
conservation of species in their ecosystems, nor the diverse needs of the 
CITES Parties. The U.S. comments and those of other Parties were 
discussed at the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee, in Geneva in March 
1994. Some of the U.S. comments were taken into consideration in 
developing the final Standing Committee draft resolution. The Standing 
Committee resolution was not available to the United States or other CITES 
Parties until after the June 10 deadline for submission of resolutions and 
proposals to the CITES Secretariat. The Standing Committee resolution 
contains six annexes, several of which the United States looks forward to 
discussing further with the CITES Parties at COP9. In particular, the 
United States believes the Standing Committee draft is an improvement on 
the Berne Criteria as regards precautionary measures. However, the United 
States believes that Annex 1 (Biological criteria for Appendix I) and Annex 
2 (Criteria for inclusion of species in Appendix II) are in need of major 
revision, particularly from a scientific perspective. The United States is 
particularly concerned about the utility and scientific validity of 
arbitrary numerical cutoffs for decision-making on which Appendix a species 
should be included in. After detailed review of the scientific literature 
and consultation with other Federal agencies, the United States has 
submitted alternatives to those Annexes to the Secretariat, along with some 
additional material for inclusion in the resolution. The U.S. intent is to 
urge the CITES Parties to substitute the Annexes 1 and 2 it submitted for 
those prepared by the Standing Committee. 
The United States could have waited to present these alternative Annexes 1 
and 2 at COP9. However, the United States preferred to provide ample time 
to Parties to review this proposed alternative to the document submitted to 
the Parties by the Standing Committee. The United States believes that 
increased flexibility must be included in any revised listing criteria. 
The biological criteria submitted by the United States for inclusion of 
species in Appendix I (Annex 1) are grounded in the scientific literature, 
and are based on the concept that determination of whether a species is 
threatened with extinction should be risk averse, utilizing the best 
available scientific and trade information, and assessment of a series of 
biological factors and criteria. The proposed Annex 1 lists a series of 
interdependent factors to be included in an assessment of the status of a 
species, and thereby the determination that it is threatened with 
extinction. The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex 2 (in 
accordance with Article II paragraph 2(a)) of the Convention involve a 
determination of whether a species may become threatened with extinction, 
in order to avoid utilization incompatible with its survival. 
The Service received numerous comments recommending that the United States 
submit an alternative to the Standing Committee draft resolution. Several 
comments provided detailed analyses of the IUCN submission to the 
Secretariat, and of the resolution submitted to the Parties prior to the 
31st meeting of the Standing Committee. These comments were taken into 
consideration by the Service and other Federal agencies. 


27. Inclusion of Species in Appendix III 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, the 
Service is aware that a resolution on this issue has been prepared by the 
Animals Committee. The Service is supportive of urging of more judicious 
use of Appendix III, including recommending direct consultation with the 
Animals or Plants Committee and a review of existing Appendix III listings.

The CITES Secretariat has been working to screen Appendix III proposals and 
consult with the submitting Party. 


28. Guidelines for Evaluating Marine Turtle Ranching Proposals 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, the 
United States participated in a working group at the ninth meeting of the 
Animals Committee in Brussels in September, 1993 which developed draft 
guidelines for recommendation to the Animals Committee on this issue. The 
ninth meeting of the Animals Committee adopted a requirement for ``regional 
management on the basis of genetically defined populations''. The United 
States strongly supported that element, which may have been removed by a 
subsequent meeting of the Animals Committee. The United States remains 
supportive of regional cooperation in the management of such widely 
migratory endangered species as marine turtles. 


29. Proposals To Register the First Commercial Captive-breeding Operation 
for an Appendix I Animal Species 


No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. 


30. Standard Nomenclature 


Support adoption of the resolution submitted by the United States, which 
was submitted at the request of the Nomenclature Committee. 
This resolution was submitted at the request of the CITES Nomenclature 
Committee, and deals with nomenclature and taxonomy of CITES species. The 
resolution submitted was discussed and agreed upon by the Nomenclature 
Committee at its May, 1994 meeting in Beijing, China. The names of the 
genera and species of several families are in need of standardization and 
the current lack of a standard reference with adequate information creates 
an implementation problem for some species. The United States also 
recognizes that the taxonomy used in the appendices to the Convention will 
be most useful to the Parties if standardized and correlated by 
nomenclatorial references. 
This resolution makes several recommendations dealing with the inclusion of subspecies in the Appendices, use of
references in proposals, synonyms, and 
the role of the Scientific Authorities in nomenclature issues. The resolution also recommends several standard
references for species listed in the CITES Appendices, for mammals, birds, amphibians, cacti, cycads, tree ferns,
and other plants. 


XV. Consideration of Proposals for Amendment of Appendices I and II 


See the 

Federal Register

 notice published on September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46023), which sets forth summaries of the proposed U.S. negotiating 
positions on the proposals for amendment to the CITES Appendices for COP9 
and requests information and comments from the public on these proposed 
U.S. positions. 


XVI. Conclusion of the meeting 


1. Determination of the Time and Venue of the Next Regular Meeting of 
the Conference of the Parties 


No documents have been received indicating requests from possible host 
governments. Favor holding COP10 in a country where all Parties will be 
admitted without political difficulties. Support the holding of COPs on a 
biennial basis, or, as in the case of COP9, after an interval of two and 
one half years. 
COP meetings energize governmental and nongovernmental organizations 
concerned with CITES issues to examine its implementation, and the 
conservation of affected species. The United States recognizes that the 
financial burdens of hosting a Conference of the Parties may serve to 
discourage developing countries from offering to serve as host, unless 
innovative ways can be found to provide them with financial assistance. 


Request for Information and Comments 


The Service invites information and comments on the proposed negotiating 
positions on COP9 agenda items, excluding item XV, ``Consideration of 
proposals for amendment of Appendices I and II,'' which is the subject of a 
separate 

Federal Register

 notice. Information and comments on this present notice should be submitted to the Service no later than October 19,
1994.

Alra Laboratories, Inc., Denial of Application for Registration




On March 4, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), directed an Order to Show Cause to Alra Laboratories, Inc. (Respondent), proposing to deny its application
for registration as a manufacturer of controlled substances, on grounds that: (1) during an on-site inspection in
July 1990 DEA investigators determined that although it was not registered to do so, Respondent continued to distribute
and possess controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 843(a)(2), had failed to comply with inventory
and recordkeeping requirements regarding these controlled substances, and had improperly stored controlled substances
together with non-controlled drugs and other materials; (2) in April 1987 Respondent was cited for failure to file
periodic ARCOS reports for 1985, 1986, and the first quarter of 1987; (3) as the result of a November 1987 inspection,
Respondent was issued a Letter of Admonition citing its failure to file ARCOS reports as required by 21 U.S.C. 827(d)
and 21 CFR 1304.35, an accurate biennial inventory in violation of 21 U.S.C. 827(a) and 21 CFR 1304.11, and its failure
to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances as required by 21 CFR 1301.71; (4)
in 1986, 1988, and 1989 Respondent did not timely renew its registration; and (5) Respondent has a history of violating
Food and Drug Administration [FDA] requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, documentation and good manufacturing
practices.


Respondent, by counsel, filed a request for hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was
docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held
in Chicago, Illinois, on August 18 and 19, 1992.


On July 30, 1993, in her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision, the administrative
law judge recommended that Respondent's application for registration be granted, contingent upon a satisfactory
pre-registration investigation and upon Respondent arranging at its own expense for annual independent audits
of its controlled substance handling for a period of five years after registration is granted. No exceptions were
filed by either party, and on August 30, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator.
On October 13, 1993, the DEA Chief Counsel filed a request for remand with the Administrator, and on October 27, 1993,
then-Administrator Robert C. Bonner remanded the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings,
noting that an indictment had been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
alleging that Respondent's owner had violated the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) with respect to the manufacture
and distribution of prescription drugs.

On November 3, 1993, the administrative law judge rescinded her July 30, 1993 decision, reopened the record, and directed
the parties to submit statements specifying the additional evidence that they wished to produce. A hearing on remand
was scheduled, but canceled after the Government advised that it had no further evidence other than the indictment
itself. Respondent submitted additional documents and both parties submitted argument on remand. On May 12, 1994,
Judge Bittner issued her supplemental opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision,
in which she found that the Government had shown probable cause that Respondent's owners had committed the acts alleged,
but that the Government had failed to show the criminal conduct alleged by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly,
Judge Bittner found that there was no basis to modify her previous conclusions set forth in her July 1993 decision,
and therefore she reissued that decision. No exceptions were filed by either party. On June 17, 1994, the administrative
law judge transmitted the entire reord, including her original and supplemental opinions, to the Deputy Administrator.

The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

In her supplemental opinion issued on May 12, 1994, the administrative law judge found that there was nothing on the
record from the 1992 hearing or upon remand tending to prove or disprove the allegations of the August 13, 1993 indictment
or the January 26, 1994 superseding indictment. The Deputy Administrator adopts this finding of the administrative
law judge. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has not considered any of the matters offered on remand and, in this
decision, will refer solely to matters on the record from the 1992 hearing.

The administrative law judge found that Respondent is a pharmaceutical manufacturer founded by Baldev Raj Bhutani,
Ph.D., in 1982. Respondent was registered as a manufacturer of controlled substances by DEA on July 30, 1982, and renewed
this registration in June 1983 and July 1984. Respondent developed a generic form of clorazepate dipotassium, a Schedule
IV controlled substance, and received FDA approval to market it in 1988. In 1991, Respondent subsequently received
FDA approval to manufacture dosage forms of the Schedule IV controlled substances propoxyphene and meprobamate,
and acquired Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) for the Schedule IV controlled substance chlordiazepoxide.

The administrative law judge found that in December 1984, DEA investigators conducted a regularly scheduled investigation
and determined that Respondent was generally in compliance with DEA recordkeeping requirements, except that it
had never filed required Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) reports. Dr. Bhutani was advised
by DEA investigators of the proper reporting procedure for a manufacturer, and the less stringent reporting requirements
under a DEA researcher registration. No further action was taken. In his testimony, Dr. Bhutani disputed this version
of the events, but Judge Bittner credited the investigator's testimony, while finding Dr. Bhutani's answers to be
less than wholly responsive.

In November 1987, DEA investigators conducted another periodic investigation of Respondent. Investigators determined
that Respondent still had not been filing required ARCOS reports since the previous inspection in 1984. Dr. Bhutani
attributed this problem to a lack of National Drug Code (NDC) numbers for his product, but Judge Bittner again found
the investigator's testimony more credible. Investigators also determined that Respondent did not have a required
accurate biennial inventory, and had stored controlled substance raw material in a filing cabinet located in an unsecured
and unapproved storage area. As a result of this inspection, DEA issued Respondent a letter of admonition. Respondent
represented, in a subsequent letter to DEA, that he had reviewed the inventory records and corrected any errors.

The administrative law judge found that in July 1982, an investigator from the FDA determined that Respondent was
not complying with mandated good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and issued a Form 482 list of deficiencies to Respondent.
Subsequently, after an inspection in March 1983, FDA issued a notice of adverse findings to Respondent citing non-compliance
with tamper-resistant packaging requirements. In December 1983, FDA issued a regulatory letter to Respondent regarding
combination over-the-counter drugs. FDA inspections in October 1984 and November 1985 indicated that Respondent
was not complying with GMPs. Another regulatory letter was issued in February 1986. Another inspection in that same
month disclosed GMP deviations which let the FDA to recommend against using Respondent as a government supplier.
Follow-up inspections in May and June 1986 indicated that Respondent was still not in compliance. Afterwards, the
FDA considered obtaining an injunction against Respondent, but follow-up inspections in September and October
1986 indicated that Respondent was then sufficiently in compliance. Respondent was found in compliance in December
1986 and January 1987, but at the next scheduled FDA inspection in September and October 1989, GMP deficiencies were
again discovered. Another regulatory letter was issued on April 30, 1990. A follow-up inspection in January 1991
revealed deficiencies that resulted in a Complaint for Forfeiture being filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois. As a result, Respondent's prescription drug inventory was seized on March
19, 1991. On July 9, 1991, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois found Respondent's
drugs to be adulterated. Respondent was permitted to recondition some of these drugs and was permitted to resume operations
in November 1991.

An FDA official testified at the hearing in this matter that Respondent's history was one of ``just being unable to
bring themselves into compliance with GMPs. * * *'' Respondent testified that he disagreed with this
assessment and had hired a consultant who performed a GMP audit and found only minor problems.
DEA commenced another periodic inspection of Respondent in July 1990, and discovered that Respondent's DEA registration
had expired on June 30, 1989. Accordingly, Respondent was illegally selling and in possession of approximately 178,000
dosage units of the Schedule IV controlled substance clorazepate dipotassium. On July 26, 1990, DEA placed Respondent's
stock of controlled substances under seal. Additionally, investigators found that Respondent had not filed timely
renewal applications from 1984 through 1988. Dr. Bhutani claimed that this was due to clerical oversight.
DEA returned to Respondent on July 31, 1990, and executed a search warrant. This search determined that Respondent
was using his secure storage area and safe for the storage of items other than controlled substances in violation of
the regulations, and had no documentation of the registration of his controlled substance customers.
On July 26, 1990, Respondent filed an application for a new DEA registration as a manufacturer of Schedule III through
V controlled substances. That application is the subject of these proceedings.

The administrative law judge found that in June of 1991, DEA investigators returned to Respondent's facility as part
of the evaluation of the pending application. Investigators noted that the facility had been enlarged, that ``it
was a pretty * * * good looking [plant]'', and that there was no controlled substance activity underway.
Dr. Bhutani testified that he had designed and completed an addition to his facility in order to meet DEA requirements.
On June 1, 1992, Respondent was registered as a researcher in Schedule III through V by the DEA. Respondent hired a consultant
in May 1992 to make recommendations and do follow-up consulting if the application for a manufacturer's registration
is approved. This consultant testified at the proceeding that he had made many recommendations and that Respondent
appeared ready to adopt procedures which would bring it into compliance with DEA requirements. Dr. Bhutani testified
that some of the consultant's recommendations had in fact been implemented as of the date of the hearing.
The administrative law judge found that the Government maintained that over a ten year period, Respondent's failure
to comply with GMPs and past experience in handling controlled substances gave no assurance that Respondent could
conduct itself consistent with the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in the future. The Government
further maintained that Dr. Bhutani tended to minimize the severity of Respondent's violations and blame others
for its regulatory difficulties. Respondent asserted that its past violations were de minimis or due to inadvertence,
and that it had demonstrated itself capable of understanding and meeting DEA requirements.
The Deputy Administrator may deny an application to manufacture controlled substances in Schedules III through
V if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(d),
``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors shall be considered:
(1) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances and any controlled
substance in Schedule III, IV, or V compounded therefrom into other than legitimate medical, scientific or industrial
channels;
(2) Compliance with applicable State and local law;
(3) Promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing these substances and the development of new substances;
(4) Prior conviction record of applicant under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution,
or dispensing of such substances;
(5) Past experience in the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances, and the existence
in the establishment of effective controls against diversion; and
(6) Such other factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.''

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 54 FR 16422 (1989). 

Of the stated factors, the administrative law judge found that there is little if any evidence that the Respondent
failed to comply with applicable State and local law, or was convicted under Federal or State law, or developed new
substances or promoted technical advances. Accordingly, Judge Bittner determined that the first, fifth and sixth
factors are relevant to the proceeding. 

Under the first and fifth factors, the administrative law judge found that Respondent's past practices with respect
to recordkeeping, reporting, and security are clearly relevant. With respect to the sixth factor, the administrative
law judge found that Respondent's history of noncompliance with FDA regulations was relevant to the public health
and safety. Judge Bittner found that for a number of years, Respondent's compliance with DEA and FDA regulations ranged
from poor to abysmal, eventually culminating in seizure of its drug products by both the FDA and DEA. Furthermore,
she found that Dr. Bhutani was less than responsive to the regulatory concerns, and tended to hold others responsible
for Respondent's failures and to minimize the seriousness of the deficiencies. Judge Bittner concluded that there
was a legitimate basis for the Deputy Administrator to find that the registration of the Respondent as a manufacturer
of Schedule III through V controlled substances would be inconsistent with the public interest. 

However, the administrative law judge recommended, ``admittedly with some reservations'', that the Respondent's
application be granted because the Respondent has undertaken measures to improve its physical security, standard
operating procedures, recordkeeping and reporting, and that Dr. Bhutani recognized that compliance with FDA and
DEA requirements was mandatory for continued business operation. 

The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision
of administrative law judge, except as noted below. 

The Deputy Administrator finds that with respect to the first and fifth factors, Respondent has failed to maintain
proper records and submit reports, failed to ensure that its facility has proper security and that it was properly
registered with the DEA as a manufacturer, and illegally possessed and distributed controlled substances. 

The Deputy Administrator further finds with respect to the sixth factor that Respondent has a lengthy history of violations
of the FD&C GMP regulations related to its activities as a manufacturer of controlled substances. A manufacturer
is at the apex of the legitimate controlled substance distribution system, often producing large quantities of the
most dangerous drugs of abuse, and making these controlled substances widely available to hundreds of thousands
of registered controlled substance handlers for ultimate dispensing to patients. A registrant conducting the business
activities of a manufacturer bears some of the heaviest responsibilities under the regulatory scheme of the CSA.
Respondent, in its capacity as a manufacturer, has twice been the subject of seizures of its product: once by FDA for
its adulteration of drugs, and once by DEA for illegal possession and distribution of controlled substances. 

The Deputy Administrator finds that Respondent's President and founder, Dr. Bhutani, has not taken his controlled
substance responsibilities seriously; has shown a history and pattern of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations
pertaining to controlled and non-controlled substances; has minimized the importance of compliance with these
laws and regulations; and has, throughout the years and in the instant proceedings, been less than wholly responsive,
candid, and forthright, thereby failing to evidence the type of direction and leadership to be expected of a manufacturer
under the CSA. 

The Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent has not shown the commitment to compliance required of a DEA registrant,
that its registration as a manufacturer of controlled substances would not be in the public interest, and that its
application for registration should be denied. 

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration
of Alra Laboratories, Inc., be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective on October 4, 1994.

ACTION: 

Notice of partially closed meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary's Task Force on Excellence in State and Local Government Through Labor-Management Cooperation was
established in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (Pub. L. 82-463)). A Notice of Establishment
for the Task Force was published in the June 9, 1994, 

Federal Register.

 Pursuant to Section 10(a) of FACA, this is to announce the first meeting of the Task Force which is to take place on October
19 and 20, 1994. 



The purpose of the Task Force is to investigate worker-management relations in the public sector and identify trends
in excellence in labor-management cooperation. 

Specifically, the Task Force will be asked to address the following questions: 

(1) What (if any) new methods or institutions should be encouraged to enhance the quality, productivity and cost-effectiveness
of public sector services through labor-management cooperation and employee participation, recognizing the broad
variety of functions performed by different levels of government and various other agencies and public organizations?


(2) What (if any) changes to legal frameworks which impact on labor-management relations, including collective
bargaining and civil service legislation could be considered to enhance cooperative behaviors that would improve
the delivery of services by reducing conflict, duplication and delays? 

(3) What (if anything) should be done to increase the extent to which workplace problems are resolved directly by the
parties themselves rather than through recourse to administrative bodies and the courts? 

(4) What (if anything) can be done to improve the coordination between appropriate executive and legislative bodies
to enhance labor-management relations in the public sector and to create a climate where productivity improvement,
innovation and risk taking are encouraged and rewarded? 

(5) What conditions are necessary to enable elected political leaders, public managers, public employees and labor
organizations to work together to achieve excellence in state and local government? What (if any) are the obstacles,
and how can they be overcome? 

(6) What examples of successful cooperative efforts are appropriate to serve as public sector models? Why have some
initially successful efforts failed, and what can be done to enhance prospects for success?

<DOCTITLE>Fuelco, Denver, CO.; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration </DOCTITLE>



On September 13, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice
of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 9, 1994 and published in the Federal register

FR 43866). 
The company submitted information indicating that the same conditions still exist when it was certified earlier
under TA-W-27,295.


Conclusion 



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on August 15, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register

 on September 2, 1994 (59 FR 45711).

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
Department is changing the March 25, 1993 impact date to August 25, 1994 for the subject workers at Beloit, Wisconsin
because they were already covered for certification under petition TA-W-27,235 which expired on August
25, 1994.

Accordingly, the Department is amending the subject certification by deleting the old impact date of March 25, 1993
and inserting a new impact date of August 25, 1994.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,737 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of United Industries, Inc., Beloit, Wisconsin engaged in the production of stainless steel tubing who
became totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 25, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Elf Atochem North America, Inc. Industrial Chemicals Division Tacoma, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration



On July 25, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance for former workers engaged in employment related to the production
of chlor-alkali products at the subject firm.

Investigation findings show that the subject plant ceased production on April 20, 1994 resulting in the separation
of all the Tacoma workers.

On reconsideration, new information was obtained showing that a major customer switched its entire purchases of
sodium chlorate from the subject firm to a Canadian supplier.

Company officials indicated that they decided to close the Tacoma plant because of additional Canadian chlor-alkali
capacity coming on-line.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that Elf Atochem's workers
in Tacoma, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with
the chlor-alkali products produced at Elf Atochem, Tacoma, Washington. In accordance with the provisions of the
Act, I make the following revised certification for the Elf Atochem workers in Tacoma, Washington.




All workers of Elf Atochem in Tacoma, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after
December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of September 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional
Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of September, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.

(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,

(2) that sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.



Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.

The preponderance of the terminations at the subject firm are attributable to the transfer of the electroplating
and compounding operations to another affiliated domestic site for consolidation of the company.

under the terms of the Trade Act of 1974.




TA-W-30, 105; Champion Parts Northeast Div., Beech Creek, PA
TA-W-30, 106; Champion Parts Northeast Div., Lock Haven, PA




The investigation revealed that criterion (2) and criterion (3) have not been met. Sales or production did not decline

Negative Determinations NAFTA-TAA

clothing did not account for an important portion of the firm's sales decline during the period under investigation.



NAFTA-TAA-00203; Catoosa Knitting Mills, Inc., Crossville, TN



The investigation revealed that criteria (3) and criteria (4) were not met. Catoosa Knitting Mills is a contractor,

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organization; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to the Listing and Trading of Indexed Term Notes Based on a Portfolio of Banking Industry Securities



September 27, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change





The Exchange proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''),
Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based in whole or in part on changes in the value of a static portfolio
of twenty banking industry securities (``Index'').
 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change






Under Section 107 of the Guide, the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily
categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants.
 The Amex now proposes to list for trading, under Section 107A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part
on the Index.





The Notes will be non-convertible debt securities and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of
the Guide.
 Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the
Notes will provide for maturity within a period of not less than one nor more than seven years from the date of issue.
The Notes may provide for periodic payments and/or payments at maturity based in whole or in part on changes in the value
of the Index.
 In addition, the Notes may feature a ``cap'' on the maximum amount and/or a ``floor'' on the minimum amount to be paid
periodically. Additionally, the Notes shall provide that at maturity, holders will receive not less than 90% of the
initial issue price of the Notes. Prior to the commencement of listing and trading of the Notes, the Exchange shall
distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities,
including appropriate suitability criteria and/or guidelines.

Eligibility Standards for Index Components



The Components of the Index shall meet the following criteria at the time of issuance of the Notes: (1) A minimum market
capitalization of $75 million, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a market capitalization
of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less
than one million shares, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a trading volume in each of the six
months prior to the offering of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least 90% of the weight of the Index and at least 80%
of the total number of components will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in
Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components of the Index will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be
National market securities traded through Nasdaq; and (5) all components of the Index will be subject to last sale
reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Act.



Index Calculation



The Index will be calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the
component securities is represented in an approximately equal dollar amount in the Index. To create the Index, a portfolio
of equity securities will be established by the issuer representing an investment of a specified dollar amount in
each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market
value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding
the establishment of the Index.

The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate
actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split,
reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with
respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary,
in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as
the distribution of property by an issuer to stockholders. Shares of a component security may be replaced (or supplemented)
with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component stock into another class
of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary. If the security remains
in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's
relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action.
 In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index.

the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed
Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading Options on the CBOE Emerging
Latin American Markets Index</DOCTITLE>



September 27, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on July 20, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change
on August 18, 1994,
 and Amendment No. 2 on September 26, 1994.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.








I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



As provided in Exchange Rule 24.2, ``Designation of the Index,''
 the CBOE proposes to list for trading options on the CBOE Emerging Latin American Markets Index (``Emerging Latin
American Markets Index'' or ``Index''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary,
CBOE, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
 index options on the Emerging Latin American Markets Index. The Index will initially consist of ten
 closed-end funds which invest in the stocks of firms in the emerging Latin American economies. According to the Exchange,
no proxy for the performance of these emerging economies is currently available in the U.S derivatives markets. The
Exchange believes, therefore, that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating
in the performance of these markets and/or hedging against the risk of investing in the Latin American emerging markets.






Index Design



The Emerging Latin American Markets Index will initially consist of ten closed-end funds.
 All of the closed-end fund components of the Index currently trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00151 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00087 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As of September 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $118.63
million to a high of $1.294 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $313.35 million. The closed-end
fund accounting for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Chile Fund Inc. (16.64%),
while the smallest was the Argentina Fund Inc. (5.65%).



Calculation



The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December
31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor
that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on September 15, 1994, was 168.07.
The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-scale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation.



Maintenance



The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
certain rights issuances.

The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the emerging Latin American markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component from the
Index, every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such circumstances,
the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed
replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain nine closed-end funds in the Index at all times.



Long-Term Index Options



In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10th) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value
Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced
value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.



Exercise and Settlement



Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Latin American Markets Index options. The Exchange
states that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month.
Thus, the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding
the expiration date.





Exchange Rules Applicable


Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based indexes
will be applicable to Index options.
 Pursuant to Exchange Rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Latin American Markets Index will be
subject to position limits of 7,500 contracts.
 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis.
Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP
for purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support
new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options an Index LEAPS.

American Markets Index pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote
just and equitable principles of trade, foster cooperation and coordination with persons facilitating transactions
in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change
Modifying Comparison Procedures for Corporate Bond and Unit Investment Trust Transactions and Modifying the Fee
Structure for Correction Fees</DOCTITLE>



September 27, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on August 9, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's trade comparison procedures for corporate bond and unit investment trust
(``UIT'') transactions and corresponding correction fees. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Since 1993, NSCC has been redesigning its bond comparison system to accelerate the processing (

i.e., 

submission and comparison) of bond transactions to achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in
the comparison process. NSCC believes accelerated processing will help to increase certainty and reduce risk in
the clearance and settlement of debt transactions. The first phase of this redesign process enhanced the processing
of transactions in municipal securities and was implemented by NSCC on August 13, 1993.
 The primary purpose of the current proposed rule change is to expand the accelerated comparison system to include
the processing of transactions in corporate bonds and UITs. the proposed rule change also will permit NSCC to provide
comparison services for baby bonds (

i.e., 

corporate bonds having a par value of less than $1,000) and new issue trading. The proposed rule change also will modify
the fee structure for correction fees. 





Under the proposed rule change, the cutoff time for submission of original trade input for all corporate bond and UIT
transactions will be moved from 1:00 p.m. on the day following trade date (``T+1'') to 2:00 a.m. on T+1. These trades
will be reported back to members by 8:00 a.m. on T+1. Adjustments to original trade input will have to be made prior to
the time specified by NSCC on T+1, which will be 6:00 p.m. 

NSCC will accept trade input for trade-for-trade processing of corporate baby bonds. If transactions are submitted
as a mixed lot (

i.e., 

submissions including baby bonds and round lots), the baby bond and the round lot portions of the transaction will
be separated by NSCC upon input. 

At the option of members, corporate bond and UIT transactions will be compared when the net buy side and sell side aggregate
principal amounts can be matched for a particular security, even if the relevant principal amounts are specified
in more than one buy side and/or more than one sell side submission, if the transactions would have been compared had
such buy side and sell side principal amounts each been specified on a single submission.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941004-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941004-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because correction processing occurs at the New York and American Stock Exchanges and at the National Association
of Securities Dealers before the trade input is transmitted to NSCC, Add-by-Seller tickets, as well as Delete-by-Seller,
Delete Add-by-Seller and Delete-by-Buyer instructions, will no longer be accepted under the proposed rule.
 This change is being proposed in order to standardize correction processing.





NSCC will provide comparison services for corporate bond new issue transactions on the same basic terms and conditions
as are currently provided for municipal securities transactions with the exception of syndicate takedown processing.
 Original trade input for new issue corporate bond transactions will be accepted until the third day prior to the initial
settlement date for the issue. Original input may set forth either (1) A final settlement price and a settlement date
that is either the initial settlement date or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date or (2) a dollar
price. Original trade input that is submitted between three and five days prior to the initial settlement date but
does not set forth a final settlement price and settlement date or does not set forth a dollar price will be treated as
regular input. Any corporate bond new issue transactions that remain uncompared at the opening of business on the
day prior to the initial settlement date will be deleted from NSCC's system.







NSCC's fee structure relating to correction fees will be amended to reflect that correction capabilities will be
accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. These fee changes will conform all bond correction fees
to the fees implemented in connection with municipal securities transaction processing in that participants will
be charged for supplemental input on or after T+1.
 Currently, NSCC charges participants for supplemental input relating to corporate bond and UIT transactions on
or after T+2. In addition, the bond system correction fees for ``don't know'' and ``questioned trade'' input will
be deleted because NSCC no longer processes such transactions. The proposed rule change also makes certain conforming
changes and deletions to NSCC's Procedures in order to reflect greater uniformity in NSCC's bond comparison system
and to eliminate certain language which has become obsolete.





The proposed changes to NSCC's comparison procedures should help achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier
points in the comparison process and thus increase certainty and reduce risk in the clearance and settlement of corporate
bond and UIT transactions. Moreover, the expansion of corporate bond processing to cover baby bond and new issue transactions
will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. Therefore, NSCC believes
the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



NSCC has not solicited or received any comments. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received
by NSCC.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) As the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Adoption of New Rule 123A.46</DOCTITLE>


September 27, 1994.


On February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt a new Rule 123A.46 pertaining to members' representation of multiple orders.





The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34343 (July 11, 1994), 59
FR 36243 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
Currently, the NYSE Rules do not place any limitations upon members who represent orders for more than one customer
at the same time and on the same side of the market. New Rule 123A.46 will require such members and member organizations
(including ``upstairs'' trading personnel) to inform customers if their orders may not receive an execution in time
priority of receipt, or may not receive an equal or proportional split.
For example, if a broker was representing three not held orders to buy stock, one for 100,000 shares, and two for 50,000
shares each, and the broker executed a trade for 12,000 shares, the broker will be permitted under Rule 123A.46 to (1)
allocate all 12,000 shares to the customer who entered the order first (time priority), (2) split the trade equally
by giving 4,000 shares to each customer, or (3) split the trade proportionally to the customer orders, 

i.e.,

 6,000 shares, 3,000 shares and 3,000 shares. Under these circumstances, the new rule will not require NYSE members
to make a disclosure to its customers. However, if the execution would be split in any other manner, the member will
be required by Rule 123A.46 to disclose this information to its customers prior to representing the multiple orders,
unless the terms of the order provides for a different split.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.




The Commission believes that new NYSE Rule 123A.46 will benefit investors by requiring that they are informed of the
manner in which their orders will be executed should a member represent multiple orders on the same side of the market.
The rule specifies that in this situation, members may execute the customer orders in time priority of receipt, or
split the execution equally among the orders or proportionally based upon the size of the orders. If members who represent
multiple orders on the same side of the market allocate executions in any other manner, they must first inform their
customers. Customers would then have the ability to withdraw their orders if they so desire.
The Commission believes that requiring members to notify customers if their orders may be executed other than in the
specified manners allows investors to better monitor the representation of their orders and helps to ensure that
their orders are being handled fairly and equitably. By requiring such executions or notification to customers,
investors are assured that their orders will not be executed in a manner which they believe may be disadvantageous
to their interests.







It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-03) is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. Each of the Funds is an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the Act. With the
exception of The Investment Company of America, which is a Delaware corporation, each of the Funds is either a Massachusetts
business trust or a Maryland corporation.
2. Each Fund is governed by a board of directors/trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the
Funds within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. CRMC, a subsidiary of The Capital Group, Inc., serves as investment
adviser to each of the Funds. In addition, certain of the Funds employ advisory boards, as defined in section 2(a)(1)
of the Act, whose members (``Advisors'') consult from time to time with CRMC and Fund directors, primarily with respect
to such Fund's investments or management. No director or Advisor employed by CRMC or its affiliated companies (other
than the Funds) or by Washington Management Corporation (``WMC'') (the business manager for three of the Funds) or
its affiliates receives any remuneration from the Funds.
3. Applicants request an exemptive order to permit the Funds to offer certain deferred compensation plans (``Plans'')
to their directors who are not employees of either CRMC or its affiliates or WMC or its affiliates (the ``Non-Employee
Directors'')
 and their Advisors (collectively, the ``Participants'').
 Applicants request that the exemption requested, other than the exemption from section 13(a)(3), which is requested
only for certain of the Funds that are named as applicants, also apply to any open-end management investment company
that is advised by CRMC in the future.





4. The purpose of the Plans is to permit Participants to defer receipt of all or a percentage of the fees otherwise payable
to them by such Fund. Fees deferred under a Plan, and any earnings thereon, are not subject to federal or state income
taxation until actually received by the Participants or their beneficiaries.
5. Each of the Plans became effective upon adoption by the board of directors of the relevant Fund, prior to the filing
of the application for an exemptive order. An order is required for the Plans because the Funds wish to use returns on
investment companies in The American Funds Group (which encompasses all of the Funds named as applicants, with the
exception of the American Variable Insurance Series) to determine the amount of earnings and gains or losses allocated
in respect of a Participant's deferred compensation account (``Deferred Payment Account''); this feature may not
be implemented without SEC approval. Pending receipt of SEC approval, each Plan provides that compensation deferred
by a Participant under a Plan will be credited to the Participant's Deferred Payment Account in the form of cash, and
credited with earnings in an amount equal to the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury Bills. Any conversion of previously
credited cash amounts will be effected at the net asset value of the relevant Fund(s) as of the date of any order granting
exemptive relief or an appropriate date thereafter.
6. Compensation deferred under a Plan is credited to a Deferred Payment Account established in the name of each Participant
on the books of the relevant Fund on the date on which it would otherwise have been credited to a Participant. Participants
may select one or more Funds in The American Funds Group, in which their deferred compensation will be deemed to be invested
in the form of fictional shares (``Phantom Shares'') of the Fund(s) selected by a Participant for purposes of crediting
earnings and determining payments. Participants will receive periodic statements, at least annually, showing
the balance credited to their respective Deferred Payment Accounts. A Participant's benefits under a Plan are not
transferable or assignable, except in the event of death. If a Participant dies at any time before all amounts in his
or her Deferred Payment Account have been paid, such remaining amounts will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable
to the Participant's designated beneficiaries.
7. Except in the case of Funds that are money market funds, a Fund sponsoring a Plan will be under no obligation to a Participant
to purchase, hold, or dispose of any underlying shares of any Fund in order to exactly match its obligations to credit
or charge Participants' Deferred Payment Accounts with the earnings and gains or losses attributable to any Phantom
Shares. Nevertheless, if underlying shares of any Funds are purchased by a Fund for matching purposes, any and all
such shares will continue to be a part of the general assets and property of such Fund. Amounts credited to a Participant's
Deferred Payment Account are not evidenced by any note or other security, or funded or secured in any way. In addition,
no assets of a Fund will be segregated for the account of any participant; Participants' will be general unsecured
creditors of the relevant Fund for payments due under any Plan. The obligations under a Plan will be reflected as a liability
on the books of the relevant Fund.

8. Participants in any Plan may elect to transfer to such Plan any amounts deferred by the Participant under any Pre-Existing
Plan offered by the relevant Fund. Amounts transferred from Pre-Existing Plans will continue to earn a rate equal
to the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury Bills (as provided under the Pre-Existing Plans). Conversion to Phantom Shares
of amounts transferred to the Plans from accounts under the Pre-Existing Plans will be effected at the net asset value
of the relevant Fund(s) as of the date of any other granting exemptive relief or an appropriate date thereafter.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior securities.
Section 13(a)(2) permits an investment company to borrow funds or issue senior securities only as described in the
recitals of policy contained in its registration statement, unless authorized by its shareholders. Applicants
assert that the Plan contain none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact the restrictions
on the issuance of such securities. The Funds would not be borrowing for securities speculation. All liabilities
created by a accruals under a Plan will be offset by assets of its corresponding Fund, which would not otherwise exist
if Participants' compensation were paid on a current basis. Applicants also believe that, given the common existence
of deferred compensation plans today, the Plans will not confuse shareholders, complicate the valuation of a Fund's
shares, convey a false sense of safety, or be inconsistent with the theory of mutually of risk.
2. Section 13(a)(3) prohibits an investment company from deviating from the fundamental investment policies set
forth in its registration statement without authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities.
Applicants request an exemption from this section to enable the Funds named in the application to purchase shares
of investment companies in The American Funds Group as underlying securities for their Participants' Deferred Payment
Account without shareholder approval. Most of the Funds have fundamental investment policies that prohibit them
from purchasing the securities of other investment companies.
 This policy would prevent the Funds from purchasing shares of any other Funds in The American Funds Group without shareholder
approval. Each Fund will disclose the existence of the Plans in its prospectus and, if applicable, the exception to
its fundamental policies for which relief is requested herein in its statement of additional information. Applicants
content that the value of the underlying securities will be 

de minimis

 in relation to the total net assets of each Fund. Furthermore, the value of the underlying securities held by a particular
Fund in respect of a Participant's Deferred Payment Account would at all times equal the value of the Fund's obligations
to pay deferred fees in respect of the corresponding Phantom Shares credited to such account. Consequently, changes
in the value of such underlying securities would not affect the value of shareholders' investments. Thus, permitting
the Funds to invest in underlying securities without obtaining the shareholder approval required by section 13(a)(3)
would result in no harm to shareholders.




3. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such person, from selling any security to such investment company. This section was designed to prevent
sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they
were associated or to acquire controlling interests in such enterprises. The sale of securities issued by a Fund pursuant
to a Plan would not involve Congress' concerns in enacting this section, but would merely facilitate the matching
of a Fund's liability for a Participant's deferred fees with the underlying securities that would determine the amount
of such Fund's liability.
4. Section 22(f) prohibits a registered open-end investment company from restricting the transferability or negotiability
of any security of which it is the issuer unless the restriction is disclosed in its registration statement, and does
not contravene rules and regulations prescribed by the SEC. The section was designed to bar only those restrictions
on transferability or negotiability that were either not disclosed to the holder of the security or were expressly
prohibited by SEC rules and regulations. Applicants assert that neither of these circumstances would apply to the
restriction on transferability of a Participant's benefits under a Plan; such restrictions are clearly set forth
in the Plans and do not adversely affect the interests of the Participants or of any Fund shareholder.
5. Section 22(g) prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services
or for property other than cash or securities. The provision was intended to prevent the dilutive effect on the equity
and voting power of the equity of an open-end company that could result from the issuance of securities for consideration
not readily value. Applicants believe that the Plans do not have this effect, particularly in view of current disclosure
requirements applicable to directors' compensation. Moreover, a Fund's obligation to make payments under a Plan
would not be ``issued'' for services or for property other than cash or securities. Although any Participant's fees
which become payable to the Participant would be for services rendered to the relevant Fund, any such fees would become
payable independently of the Plans.

6. Rule 2a-7 provides that the current price per share of any money market fund may be computed by use of the amortized
cost method or the penny rounding method, provided the fund meets certain conditions. These conditions include requirements
that the fund (a) limit its investments to securities that have a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and meet certain
credit quality standards, and (b) does not maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 90
days. Applicants request an exemption from rule 2a-7 for each Fund that is a money market fund solely to the extent necessary
to permit each such Fund to invest in underlying securities (and to exclude underlying securities in calculating
its dollar-weighted average maturity) so that an exact match with the investments chosen by the participants from
such Funds can be achieved. Such an exemption would ensure that the deferred fees will not affect net asset value. The
amounts involved will in all cases be 

de minimis

 in relation to the total net assets of each fund, and will have no effect on the per share net asset value of the Fund (since
any increase or decrease in the value of the underlying securities will be precisely offset by a simultaneous increase
or decrease in the value of the Fund's liability for deferred fees). 
7. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any
person, security or transaction from any provisions of the Act, if, and to the extent that, such exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) provides that any person may file with the SEC an application
for an order exempting a proposed transaction of the applicant from one or more provisions of section 17(a), provided
that the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair, the transaction is consistent with the policy
of each registered investment company concerned, and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants
believe that the requested exemption meets the standards of sections 6(c) and 17(b).
 




8. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 thereunder are designed to limit or prevent a registered investment company's
joint or joint and several participation with an affiliated person in a transaction on a basis different from or less
advantageous than that of the affiliated person. Applicants note that, while the Plans do possess profit-sharing
characteristics, they do not have the effect of placing any Fund on a basis different from or less advantageous than
that of any Participant. The effect of a Plan is merely to defer the payment of fees that the corresponding Fund otherwise
would be obligated to pay on a current basis as services are performed by the Participants, enabling the fees to remain
as part of the Fund's general assets and property.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. If a Fund purchases shares issued by an affiliated Fund, the Fund will vote such shares in proportion to the votes
of all other holders of shares of the affiliated Fund.
2. Any Fund that is a money market fund that values its assets by the amortized cost or penny-rounding methods will buy
and hold shares in the Funds selected by a Participant that determine the performance of Deferred Payment Accounts
to achieve an exact match between the liability of any such Fund to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset that
liability.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is registered as a closed-end, diversified management 
investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On August 21, 1992, applicant filed a registration
statement on Form N-2 under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement
became effective on October 23, 1992, and the public offering of applicant's shares commenced soon thereafter.

2. On March 18, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved an agreement and plan of reorganization and liquidation
providing for the transfer of substantially all of the assets of applicant to Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal
Fund, a closed-end, diversified management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. In
exchange, the agreement provided for the issuance of shares of Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund and the assumption
by Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund of substantially all of applicant's liabilities. In accordance with
Rule 17a-8, the trustees of applicant determined that the reorganization was in the best interests of applicant
and that the interests of applicant's shareholders would not be diluted as a result.






3. A registration statement on Form N-14 was filed with the SEC on April 30, 1993, and the proxy statement/prospectus
contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders. On July 28, 1993, at applicant's annual shareholder
meeting, shareholders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the agreement and plan
of reorganization and liquidation.

4. On July 28, 1993, the effective date of reorganization, applicant had 4,490,556 shares outstanding, with a net
asset value per share of $11.68. On that date, Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund distributed to applicant's
shareholders, in exchange for their shares, shares of Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund (or cash in lieu of
fractional shares) of aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective interests
in applicant.

5. The expenses attributable to the acquisition of applicant by Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund, including
SEC registration fees, printing, accounting, and legal expenses, amounted to $155,211. These expenses were allocated
between applicant and Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund pro rata in proportion to their respective assets,
except that Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund paid all SEC registration fees.

6. Applicant has no remaining assets, outstanding debts, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation
or administrative proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders, and is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage
in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.

7. Applicant intends to file a certificate of dissolution in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
