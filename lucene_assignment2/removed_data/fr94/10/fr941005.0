Deemed Elections of Coverage Under the Federal Employees Retirement System



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is adopting, as final, its interim regulations to allow employees to remain
covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), if their employing agency erroneously placed them under
FERS during the period when they would have had the opportunity to elect FERS coverage. These regulations deem employees
to have elected FERS coverage unless they notify the employing agency that they do not want to be deemed to have elected
FERS. These regulations are necessary to prevent the agency error from depriving such employees of their statutory
right to have elected FERS coverage.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 13, 1993, we published (at 58 FR 47821) interim regulations to allow employees to remain covered by the
Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), if their employing agency erroneously placed them under FERS during
the period when they would have had the opportunity to elect FERS coverage. The interim regulations establish a procedure
under which employees (who were denied the opportunity to elect FERS coverage because their employing agency erroneously
placed them under FERS) would be deemed to have elected FERS coverage unless they notify the employing agency that
they do not want to be deemed to have elected FERS. We designed the procedure to minimize the actions that both an agency
and an employee would be required to perform to correct records. We received four comments on the interim regulations.



All of the comments were supportive of the concept of allowing this group of employees the opportunity to have FERS
coverage. The commenters expressed their concerns with specific aspects of our interim method for choosing FERS
coverage.



One commenter expressed concern that our proposal was too narrow because it failed to cover employees who were correctly
placed under full CSRS, CSRS offset, or social security only, but were incorrectly or never informed of their opportunity
to elect FERS. We believe that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 

Killip 

v. 

Office of Personnel Management, 

991 F.2d 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1993), leaves us without authority to permit coverage elections except for the situation
of employees who were incorrectly denied any right of election whatsoever during the election period provided by
statute. Specifically, the court determined that OPM did not have authority to allow retroactive belated FERS elections
made after June 30, 1988, on the basis that the employing agency provided incomplete information to the employee,
or that the employee was otherwise prevented form making an informed election by circumstances beyond the employee's
control.

Although the court decision technically applies only to elections that should have been made during the 1987 open
season, the court's analysis is equally applicable to cases of employees rehired after the open season. We believe
that the court decision prevents us from allowing retroactive transfers by any employees who did have an opportunity
to make an election, regardless of circumstances that may have prevented the employee from making an informed election.
Accordingly, we could not adopt this suggestion.

Three commenters requested that we provide more information about the procedures that agencies will be expected
to follow when implementing the regulations. We will provide agencies with instructions on documenting elections
and correction of records under these regulations in the usual manner, through a payroll office letter.

Three commenters objected to the interim procedure that deems the employee to have elected FERS coverage unless the
employee informs the agency of the desire not to be covered by FERS. Each objected for different reasons.

The interim procedures were based on the premise that most employees who have been automatically covered by FERS in
error will want to continue to be covered under FERS. One commenter questioned this premise. However, our experience
in handling belated FERS election requests causes us to believe this premise is correct. We continue to believe that
this procedure will cause the maximum number of employees to have the retirement coverage they want without having
to elect out of FERS.

One commenter suggested that we require an affirmative FERS election to obviate the need for agencies to develop procedures
for handling requests to waive the time limit. The commenter also suggested that the ``open-ended nature of the passive
election almost guarantees that there will be waiver requests and that agencies will feel obligated to grant them,''
resulting in longer periods for which the records will have to be corrected. The commenter states, ``The agency will
also sustain additional losses in contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. (Agencies forfeit automatic and matching
contributions that are more than one year old.)'' While these problems will occur, we believe that requiring an affirmative
FERS election, which, under 

Killip, 

would also require an inflexible time limit, would not be sufficiently responsive to the needs of the employee who
has already been placed in a difficult situation because of an agency error. Agencies can avoid problems concerning
waiver of the time limit by providing adequate counseling and follow-up procedures to assure that employees make
informed choices during the 60-day period.

Although the regulatory procedures deem employees to have elected FERS if the employee takes no action, we strongly
encourage agencies to follow-up all cases involving these regulations and to obtain and document express (and written)
elections whenever possible. We expect agencies to approve waivers of the time limit in which to decline the deemed
election unless they can document that the employee did not act with reasonable diligence or that the employee made
an informed choice of FERS. Because of the adverse consequence for agencies that the commenter noted, agencies should
develop procedures to fully document their counseling efforts and employee elections.

One commenter questioned the provisions concerning the rights of survivors. The regulations provide a special rule
if an employee dies during the election period. Because the employee's election period ended prematurely due to death,
the benefits payable to the survivor (either FERS or the benefits available in the absence of a deemed election) depend
on whether the deemed election is forced upon the survivor. Because of the unique situation created by a deemed election,
the regulations allow a survivor to decline the deemed election. In this way, we are assuring that the deemed election
will not deprive a survivor of benefits established by statute, while providing what the employee and survivor would
be anticipating (benefits under FERS) unless the survivor chooses otherwise.

One commenter raised questions concerning eligibility of an employee to be deemed to have elected FERS when a former
spouse is entitled to a portion of the employee annuity or a survivor annuity. Deemed elections are permitted only
for employees who were eligible to elect FERS during the election period. Agencies will have to confirm eligibility
by obtaining a certification from the employee concerning former spouses, similar to the certification required
on the SF 3109, Election of FERS Coverage, or by obtaining telephone approval from our Court-Ordered Benefits Section.

Two commenters specifically raised questions about the effective date of the deemed elections. The effective date
is the later of the employee's entry-on-duty date or the beginning of the first pay period commencing after June 30,
1987. In devising the interim procedure we wanted to minimize the correction of records. If as we expect most employees
affected by these regulations will want FERS coverage, records correction will be minimal. The only correction action
required in cases of employees whose entry-on-duty date is on or after the beginning of the first pay period in July
1987, will be an SF-50 showing that FERS coverage, as of the entry-on-duty date was by election, rather than automatic.
Of course, if the employee was erroneously placed in FERS before the beginning of the first pay period of July 1987 or
if the employee elects not to be covered by FERS, more substantial records corrections will be required. We will issue
a payroll office letter to provide more details on correction of records. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government
employees and their survivors.

NRC Library; Address Change 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations regarding the availability of material approved
for incorporation by reference to make a needed change to the address provided for the NRC Library. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is revising those portions of 10 CFR chapter I that reference the availability
of materials that have been approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register for incorporation by reference.
This amendment revises the text of 10 CFR chapter I to indicate the current location where this material is available
for inspection. The material that has been approved for incorporation by reference is maintained and available for
inspection at the NRC Library, which is now located at 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852-2738.

Because this is an amendment dealing with agency practice and procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendment is of a minor
and administrative nature dealing with an address change. 


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150-0007,
-0010, -0002, and -0036.

Customs Service Field Organization; Extension of Port Limits of Morgan City, Louisiana


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations pertaining to the field organization of Customs by extending the geographical
limits of the port of entry of Morgan City, Louisiana. The current boundaries are being extended to include Lafayette
Parish. This change is being made in order to include Lafayette Regional Airport and to complement current international
trade activities at the Morgan City port of entry. This change will enable Customs to obtain more efficient use of its
personnel, facilities, and resources and to provide better service to carriers, importers, and the general public.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


As part of its continuing program to obtain more efficient use of its personnel, facilities and resources, and to provide
better service to carriers, importers and the public, Customs is amending  101.3, Customs Regulations (19
CFR 101.3), to expand the boundaries of the port of Morgan City, Louisiana. The expansion 
of the port will add Lafayette Parish to the existing limits which are the parishes of Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary,
and Terrebonne, the corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle, and that portion of the right-of-way pertaining to
State Highway 1 extending in a northeasterly direction from the Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish boundary line
to the corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle.
The addition of Lafayette Parish, including Lafayette Regional Airport, will complement the current international
trade activities in the parishes of Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary and Terrebonne and the town of Grand Isle. Lafayette
Parish's inclusion in the international port of entry will provide a boost to the economy of southern Louisiana. It
will reduce the operating costs of recipients of Customs services, thereby greatly improving prospects for international
trade. 


Comments


Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23817) on May 9, 1994 which invited the public to comment on this proposed change to the port limits.
Nine comments were received. All of them were in favor of the proposed expansion. Accordingly, the amendment is being
published in final as it was proposed.


Revised Port Limits


The revised port limits are as follows: 
In the State of Louisiana: All of the territory within the 
Parishes of Iberia, Lafayette, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Terrebonne; the Corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle;

and that portion of the right-of-way pertaining to State 
Highway 1 extending in a northeasterly direction from the 
Lafourche Parish and Jefferson Parish boundary line to the 
corporate limits of the town of Grand Isle. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Although Customs solicited public comments on this port expansion, no notice of proposed rulemaking was required
because the port expansion relates to agency management and organization. Accordingly, this document is not subject
to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). 


Executive Order 12866 


This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order
12866. 


Drafting Information


The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel
from other offices participated in its development. 


List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 101 


Customs duties and inspection, Exports, Imports, Organization and functions (Government agencies). 


Amendment to the Regulations


Accordingly, Part 101 of the Customs Regulations is amended as set forth below: 


PART 101_GENERAL PROVISIONS 


1. The general authority citation for Part 101 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 301, 19 U.S.C. 2, 66, 1202 (General Note 17, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), 1623, 1624.



 101.3 

[Amended]


2. The list of Customs regions, districts and ports of entry in 
 101.3(b) is amended by removing the reference ``T.D. 93-30'' and adding in its place ``T.D. 94-77'',
alongside ``Morgan City'' in the column headed ``Ports of entry'' in the New Orleans, Louisiana District of the South
Central Region.

Mailing Prescription Medicines Containing Narcotic Drugs and Other Controlled Substances 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The final rule will remove a provision in the current postal regulations that restricts use of the mails to carry prescription
medicine containing narcotic drugs. This rule also would fully harmonize those regulations, namely, Domestic Mail
Manual CO23.6.8 and CO23.6.9, with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. As a consequence,
such use of the mail by dispensers of such medicine would be allowed to the same extent that distribution via any carrier
is permitted under the Controlled Substances Act and implementing regulations. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 67747-67748) on December 22, 1993, a proposal to amend the Domestic Mail Manual to remove postal regulations
restricting use of the mail to carry prescription medicine containing narcotic drugs. 




Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) CO23.6.9 currently states that ``prescription medicines containing narcotic drugs
may be mailed only by Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities to certain veterans.'' Some commercial suppliers
have reported that they routinely ship such medicines via carriers competing with the Postal Service, and that the
shipments are not prohibited by the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and its implementing regulations,
21 CFR 1300 et seq. These suppliers state that they would prefer to make these shipments via the Postal Service, except
for the foregoing restriction in postal regulations. 


Upon review, the Postal Service has found no need for provisions in its regulations on mailing controlled substances
that would be stricter than those applicable to shipments via competing carriers. Whatever the means of carriage,
such shipments must comply with the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations implementing it that provide a
comprehensive system for protecting the public. 


The revisions will make postal regulations fully consistent with that protective system. Although adopting this
proposal may lead to substantial increases in the amount of mailed medicines containing narcotics, compliance with
Postal Service regulations for preparation and packaging prerequisites should yield secure transit for those shipments.



The Postal Service received comments on the proposed rule from five parties. All comments were in favor of implementing
the proposed rule. 



List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 


Postal Service. 




For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual,
which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR 111).

PART 111_[AMENDED] 


1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001-3011, 3201-3219, 3403-3406, 3621, 3626, 5001.





2. Domestic Mail Manual C023 is hereby amended to read as follows: 



6.0 Poisons, Controlled Substances, and Drug Paraphernalia 


* * * * * 


6.8 Controlled Substances 


A ``controlled substance'' is any anabolic steroid, narcotic, hallucinogenic, stimulant, or depressant drug in
Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act (Public Law 91-513), 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and 21 CFR 1300
et seq. Because controlled substances are potentially addictive and abusable, if distribution of a controlled substance
is unlawful under 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and under any relevant implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1300 et seq., distribution
of such matter by mail is also unlawful under 18 U.S.C. 1716. Section 1716(a) prohibits from being conveyed in the mails
all matter capable of killing or injuring a person. 


6.9 Mailing Requirements 



Under 18 U.S.C. 1716(b), the Postal Service may permit the mailing of matter not outwardly or of its own force dangerous
or injurious to a person's life or health, subject to the preparation and packaging standards specified by the Postal
Service. Accordingly, if distribution of a controlled substance is lawful under 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and any relevant
implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1300 et seq., the Postal Service considers such distribution by mail to constitute
the mailing of matter not outwardly or of its own force dangerous or injurious to a person's life or health, if the following
preparation and packaging standards are met: 


a. The inner container of any parcel containing controlled substances is marked and sealed under the applicable provisions
of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq. and the regulations implementing it, 21 CFR 1300 et seq.) and
placed in a plain outer container or securely overwrapped in plain paper. 


b. If the controlled substances consist of prescription medicines, the inner container is also labeled to show the
prescription number and the name and address of the pharmacy, practitioner, or other person dispensing the prescription.



c. The outside wrapper or container is free of markings that would indicate the nature of the contents. 


* * * * * 



A transmittal letter making these changes in the pages of the Domestic Mail Manual will be published and will be transmitted
to subscribers automatically. Notice of issuance will be published in the 

Federal Register

, as provided by 39 CFR 111.3.

 This rule makes several changes to the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) rules in 40 CFR part 15 governing the 
ineligibility of facilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 
Clean Water Act (CWA) to receive Federal contracts, assistance 
and loans; and in 40 CFR part 32 governing nonprocurement 
suspension and debarment under EO 12549. This rulemaking 
conforms parts 15 and 32 to the changes EPA has made to the 
internal administrative responsibilities for the two debarment 
programs. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 




In 1993, EPA's Office of Administration and Resources 
Management (OARM) was reorganized to improve the administration 
contracts. That reorganization changed the titles of certain EPA 
officials having prescribed responsibilities under part 32 for 
the nonprocurement suspension and debarment program. 


Earlier this year, the EPA Administrator decided to 
reorganize the former Office of Enforcement (OE). As part of 
that reorganization, administrative responsibility for the part 
15 CAA and CWA contractor listing program was transferred to OARM 
so that all EPA debarment functions would be conducted by a 
single office. 


These two reorganizations make it necessary to amend 40 CFR 
parts 15 and 32 to conform them to EPA's internal administrative 
changes. This rulemaking also modifies provisions of part 15 so 
that they describe the current practice of publishing all CAA and 
CWA ineligibility information in the List of Debarred, Suspended, 
Voluntarily Excluded, and Ineligible Persons maintained by the 
General Services Administration. In 1995, the Agency plans to 
propose substantive revisions to 40 CFR parts 15 and 32 which 
will consolidate these two sets of rules into a single part. 



Rulemaking Analysis 


B. Executive Order 12866 


This is not a significant regulatory action under EO 12866; 
therefore, no review by the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs is required. 



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The EPA certifies that this rule does not exert a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The rule makes nomenclature changes only to existing 
rules. 


D. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this 
rule does not contain information collection requirements for 
the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 


E. Public Comments 


The EPA has not solicited public comments on this final rule.

Air Quality: Revision to Definition 
of Volatile Organic Compounds_Exclusion of Volatile Methyl Siloxanes and Parachlorobenzotrifluoride 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action revises EPA's definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State implementation
plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title I of the Clean Air
Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. This revision adds
parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) and volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) to the list of compounds excluded from
the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 


On September 28, 1992, the Occidental Chemical Corporation (also known as OxyChem) petitioned EPA to take all necessary
and appropriate action to exclude parachlorobenzotrifluoride (also known as 4-chlorobenzotrifluoride, PCBTF,
C

7

H

F

Cl (CAS number 98-56-6)) from regulation as a precursor to tropospheric ozone. In support of their petition,
Occidental Chemical Company submitted two reports: ``Loss Processes for 4-Chlorobenzotrifluoride Under
Atmospheric Conditions,'' by Roger Atkinson, Sara M. Aschmann, Arthur M. Winer and James N. Pitts, Jr., University
of California at Riverside, October 1984; and ``Tropospheric Lifetime Estimates for Several Aromatic Compounds,''
by David Nelson and Robert Brown, Aerodyne Research, Inc., May 1992. In addition, Occidental Chemical Company submitted
a copy of an October 18, 1985 

Federal Register

 notice (50 FR 42216) which announced a decision by EPA not to require further testing of parachlorobenzotrifluoride
for health effects, environmental effects, and chemical fate under the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
On December 11, 1992, Dow Corning Corporation petitioned EPA to take several actions that would have the effect of
exempting VMS under the Act as precursors to tropospheric ozone. The VMS are organic compounds whose basic molecular
structure is built on a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, formed into either a ring or linear chain
containing from two to seven silicon atoms. Methyl groups (and no other functional groups, as defined here) are attached
to this central backbone, their numbers varying with the size and shape of the molecule. Compounds covered by the designation
VMS in this proposal are cyclic, branched, or linear, completely methylated siloxanes, including the compounds
listed in Table 1. Symbols shown in the table, such as MM and D

4

, are commonly accepted abbreviations for the longer chemical name shown beside each.

Based on the results of reactivity studies demonstrating that VMS do not contribute to tropospheric ozone formation,
Dow Corning Corporation requested that EPA do the following: 

1. Amend EPA's general regulatory definition of VOC appearing in 40 CFR 51.100(s) (see 57 FR 3945, February 3, 1992)
so as expressly to exclude VMS from the term ``VOC'' by final regulatory action. 

2. In taking action on any currently-pending or future proposal to approve State VOC regulations as part of a SIP, clarify
that EPA lacks authority to approve or enforce VOC regulations to the extent that they apply to VMS or otherwise regulate
VMS as precursors to tropospheric ozone. 

3. In taking any future proposed or final regulatory action to amend or promulgate VOC regulations for the purpose
of reducing tropospheric ozone (e.g., any action pursuant to section 183(e) of the Act to control VOC in consumer and
commercial products), take such action and make such statements as may be necessary to ensure that such regulations
will not apply to VMS. 

4. Take such other actions and make such other statements as may be necessary to implement the exemption of VMS from
regulation as precursors to tropospheric ozone. 

In support of its requests, Dow Corning submitted supporting information and documentation to demonstrate that
VMS:

1. Do not contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone, and in some situations inhibit the formation of tropospheric
ozone; 

2. Do not deplete stratospheric ozone; 

3. Are generally nontoxic to humans and the environment; 

4. Are used in personal care products and other consumer products; 

5. Have potential uses as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons in a number of specified applications; and, 

6. Have a wide variety of applications and potential applications as substitutes for other VOC. 

The petition included a number of reports on smog chamber reactivity studies on VMS and other supporting information.
A copy of this material is included in the docket for this rulemaking. 

Several toxicity studies for multiple routes of exposure exist for parachlorobenzotrifluoride. In laboratory
animals, kidney and liver effects have been documented. More importantly, eye and nasal irritation were observed
during inhalation exposures. However, it is not expected to have ecological effects. There is a lack of data concerning
carcinogenicity in humans and animals. Of the volatile methyl siloxanes, only the D4 has been studied extensively.
Mild liver effects (inhalation exposure) and testicular effects (dietary exposure) were observed in laboratory
animals. The D4 compound is known to produce adverse immunological effects when injected, but it is not known if the
same effect can be elicited by inhalation exposure. These compounds are not included on the 112(b)(1) list of hazardous
air pollutants and are not regulated by any program. Our best judgment at this time is that the known toxic effects of
the pollutants do not warrant alteration of a decision to remove them from the VOC list nor warrant addition to the 112(b)(1)
list. If additional data were to alter this judgment, or if petitioned, the Agency would further consider the need
to add either or both compounds to 112(b)(1). 

If VMS and PCBTF are accepted as having negligible photochemical reactivity, exempting them from regulation as ozone
precursors could contribute to the achievement of several important environmental goals. For example, they might
be used as a substitute for several compounds (e.g., methyl chloroform) that are listed as hazardous air pollutants
(HAP) under section 112 of the Act. 

Another area of concern is finding substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODS) which are active in depleting
the stratospheric ozone layer. Under the London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the
ozone layer (``Montreal Protocol''), the United States agree to phase out production and consumption of certain
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) by the year 2000 and methyl chloroform by 2005 (see 58 FR 15016 (March 18, 1993)). In 1990,
Congress added title VI to the Act in part to provide for the implementation of this phaseout (see 42 U.S.C.  7671


et seq.

). The 1990 Amendments specified an initial list of Class I and Class II ODS, authorizing EPA to add compounds to both
lists depending on a given compound's potential to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, (

Id. 

7671a.) The 1990 Amendments further required phaseout of the production and consumption of Class I ODS by 2000, methyl
chloroform by 2002, and Class II ODS by 2030 (see 42 U.S.C. 7671c, 7671d). At the fourth meeting, in 1992, of the parties
to the Montreal Protocol in Copenhagen, Denmark, the parties adjusted the phaseout schedules of Class I substances
under the Montreal Protocol to phase out Class I CFC and methyl chloroform by 1996. In 1993, EPA proposed to accelerate
the phaseout of Class I CFC and methyl chloroform in order to discontinue use of these compounds after January 1, 1996
(see 58 FR 15022). 

As a result of these phaseout deadlines, there is a need to develop substitutes for ODS. The EPA has listed several VMS
compounds as ozone-depleting substance substitutes under the program known as the ``Significant New Alternatives
Policy'' (SNAP) program, (59 FR 13044, March 18, 1994). Within the context of the SNAP rule, substitutes are ``acceptable''
if they are technically feasible to be used as an alternative to an ODS for particular uses and give reduced overall
risk to human health and the environment compared to the ODS they replace. In the SNAP rule, EPA listed several volatile
siloxanes as acceptable substitutes for metal cleaning, electronics cleaning, and precision cleaning (59 FR 13134).
The SNAP program lists benzotrifluorides as ``pending decisions'' for use in aerosols and adhesives, coatings,
and inks (59 FR 13145). The Agency has not yet completed reviews of data for these benzotrifluoride compounds, but
plans to issue a SNAP determination for these substitutes in the next set of listing decisions (59 FR 13118). 

In these areas of concern, toxic air emissions and depletion of stratospheric ozone, adding these compounds to the
list of negligibly-reactive VOC may provide support for the EPA's pollution prevention efforts. By enacting the
Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established as a national policy that ``pollution should be prevented
or reduced at the source whenever feasible'' (42 U.S.C. 13). An important part of EPA's pollution prevention strategy
is encouraging companies to use substitutes in their production processes that are more environmentally benign
than the substances they currently use. For example, in its blueprint for a comprehensive national pollution prevention
strategy, (56 FR 7849 (February 26, 1991)), the EPA recognized that the definition of pollution prevention 
includes a ``switch to non-toxic or less toxic substitutes'' (

Id. 

at 7854).

II. The EPA Response to the Petitions 



The EPA is responding to these petitions by taking action in this notice to add PCBTF and VMS to the list of compounds
appearing in 40 CFR 51.100(s) that are excluded from the definition of VOC. By this final action, PCBTF and VMS are excluded
from the VOC definition. 

The EPA's conclusions concerning the exclusion of PCBTF are based on the report ``Loss Processes For 4-Chlorobenzotrifluoride
Under Atmospheric Conditions,'' by Roger Atkinson et al. (University of California/Riverside), October 1984.
This report along with other information was submitted by Occidental Chemical Corporation and has been placed in
the docket for this action. 

The Atkinson et al. report indicated that the k

OH

 reactivity of PCBTF (2.3 x 10

^13

cm

3

 molecule

^1

 sec

^1

) is somewhat lower than, but statistically indistinguishable from, that of ethane (2.7 x 10

^13

cm

3

 molecule

^1

 sec

^1

). Ethane is currently the most reactive of the compounds currently excluded as VOC due to negligible photochemical
reactivity. It is conceivable, however, that there are other processes, e.g., photodissociation, reaction with
ozone or with nitrogen trioxide (NO

3

) radicals, that might enhance the ozone-forming reactivity of PCBTF. Atkinson et al. explored to some extent these
possibilities by studying experimentally the photodissociation of PCBTF and its reaction with ozone. They found
a negligibly low rate of reaction with ozone and no measurable photolysis of PCBTF. The photolysis detection limit,
however, was 2.7 x 10

^6

 sec

^1

, which is a rate somewhat higher than that of the reaction rate with hydroxyl radicals (OH) in typical mid-day urban
atmospheres (1.4 x 10

^6

 sec

^1

). Thus, significant, though nonmeasurable, photodissociation of PCBTF in the atmosphere cannot be precluded.
On the other hand, it is not known whether dissociation, even if it does occur, would enhance the ozone-forming reactivity
of PCBTF. In the absence of measurable photodissociation, Atkinson et al. could not obtain evidence on the nature
and follow-up chemistry of the photodissociation products. 

In summary, the evidence available indicates that: (1) The k

OH

 reactivity of PCBTF is not higher than that of ethane, and (2) there is no evidence of processes (other than reaction
with OH) that might increase the ozone-forming reactivity above that of ethane. 

The EPA's decision concerning the exclusion of VMS as VOC is based on the following: ``Investigation of the Ozone Formation
Potential of Selected Volatile Silicone Compounds,'' by William P. L. Carter et al. (University of California/Riverside),
November 1992; ``Determination of the Atmospheric Lifetimes of Organosilicon Compounds,'' by Roger Atkinson et
al. (University of California/Riverside), September 1990; and ``Kinetics of the Gas Phase Reactions of a Series
of Organosilicon Compounds with OH and NO

3

 Radicals and O

3

 at 297

#

2K,'' by R. Atkinson et al. (Environmental Science & Technology, 

25

, p.863, 1991). These reports were submitted, along with other materials by Dow Corning, in support of its petition.
This information has been placed in the docket for this action. 

The Atkinson et al. studies indicated that volatile methyl siloxanes have k

OH

 reactivities higher than that of ethane, and suggested that follow-up smog chamber studies should be conducted to
determine their ozone-forming potentials. Such a chamber study is the subject of the Carter et al. report. Carter
produced evidence for hexamethyldisiloxane (MM), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D

4

), and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D

5

) that showed these siloxanes have negative ozone-forming potentials for commonly-occurring ambient conditions.
However, the degradation pathways (mechanism) are still not well understood. Nevertheless, the investigators
concluded that the ozone-forming reactivities of these siloxanes cannot be higher than that of ethane.

III. Final Action 



Today's final action is based on EPA's review of the material in Docket No. A-93-47. The EPA is publishing
this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates
no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the definition revision should adverse or critical comments be filed
or a request for a public hearing be made. The EPA hereby amends its definition of VOC at 40 CFR 51.100(s) to exclude PCBTF
and VMS as VOC for ozone SIP and ozone control purposes. The revised definition will apply in the Chicago ozone nonattainment
area pursuant to the 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3) definition of volatile organic material or volatile organic compound. States
are not obligated to exclude from control as a VOC those compounds that EPA has found to be negligibly reactive. However,
States should not include these compounds in their VOC emissions inventories for determining reasonable further
progress under the Act (e.g., section 182(b)(1)) and may not take credit for controlling these compounds in their
ozone control strategy. Further, these negligibly-reactive compounds may not be used for emissions netting (e.g.,
40 CFR 51.166(b)(2)(c)), offsetting (40 CFR appendix S), or trading with reactive VOC (Emissions Trading Policy
Statement, 51 FR 43814, December 4, 1986 and Economic Incentive Program Rules, 59 FR 16690, April 7, 1994). 

In addition, corrections are made to the names of three compounds which have previously been exempted from the definition
of VOC: 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC-113) is changed to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane
(CFC-113); chlorodifluoromethane (CFC-22) is changed to chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22);
and trifluoromethane (FC-23) is changed to trifluoromethane (HFC-23). These changes are corrections
to nomenclature only and are not substantive. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because it relaxes current regulatory requirements rather than imposing new ones. The EPA
has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is, therefore, not
subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. This action does not contain any information collection
requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 

Assuming this rulemaking is subject to section 317 of the Act, the Administrator concludes, weighing the Agency's
limited resources and other duties, that it is not practicable to conduct an extensive economic impact assessment
of today's action since the rule promulgated today will relax current regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the
Administrator simply notes that any costs of complying with today's action, any inflationary or recessionary effects
of the regulation, and any impact on the competitive standing of small businesses, on consumer costs, or on energy
use, will be less than or at least not more than the impact that existed before today's action.

AGENCY: 

Federal Supply Service, GSA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This regulation changes FPMR Subchapter H to authorize Heads of Federal agencies to determine who will sell the agency's
personal property and to reduce the length of the regulations. These changes delete the requirement that agencies
must report property to GSA for sale and reduce the regulations, where feasible.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




This rule is not required to be published in the 

Federal Register

 for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This order revokes a public land order insofar as it affects the remaining 1,442.14 acres of public lands withdrawn
for use by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy). The lands are no longer needed for energy purposes.
The revocation is needed to permit disposal of the land to the Navajo Nation through land exchange. The lands are within
an overlapping withdrawal and thus remain closed to surface entry, mining, and mineral leasing, but remain open to
exchange under the Act of March 3, 1921.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS implements a regulatory amendment to establish standard groundfish product types and standard product recovery
rates (PRRs) for purposes of managing the groundfish fisheries off Alaska and specify certain product types and PRRs
that may be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of pollock for purposes of calculating amounts of pollock
roe that may be retained onboard a vessel during the pollock fishery. These actions are necessary to facilitate enforcement
of existing regulatory measures and to implement a statutory prohibition against the wasteful use of pollock by stripping
roe (eggs) from female pollock and discarding female and male pollock carcasses without further processing, commonly
known as pollock roe stripping. The intended effect of this action is to promote the purposes and policies of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering Sea
and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the
Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs
were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Act and are implemented
by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations that also
pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
An explanation of, and reasons for, the establishment and specifications of standard product types and standard
PRRs are contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 44643, August 24, 1993). The notice invited comments
through September 23, 1993. It also proposed a regulatory amendment to reduce the proportion of pollock roe that may
be retained onboard a vessel while participating in the directed pollock fishery. That regulatory amendment has
already been implemented by a final rule (59 FR 14121, March 25, 1994). Six letters of comments were received that addressed
standard product types and standard PRRs. They are summarized and responded to in the Comments Received section,
below. 


Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule 


Table 2 is redesignated as Table 1 in 50 CFR 672.20(j)(1), (2) and (3)(i) and (3)(ii). 
The newly designated Table 1 in 50 CFR 672.20(j)(2) is revised as follows. 
1. Product codes and standard PRRs are established for rex sole in the GOA to accommodate a new target species category
at 50 CFR 672.20(a) resulting from 1994 groundfish specifications.

2. The standard PRR for rockfish fillets/no skin (code 22) is changed from 0.35 to 0.33, and the standard PRR for sculpins,
headed & gutted with roe (code 4) is changed from 0.88 to 0.87. These changes are insignificant and are made to reflect
information contained in the literature for these product types. 
3. A standard PRR for pollock surimi of 0.14 was proposed. That rate does not reflect seasonal variations experienced
in this product. Seasonal variations are caused by changes in the physical condition of pollock flesh during the spawning
season. This season generally occurs from January through June, followed by a recuperation period. Starting in July,
the condition of pollock flesh improves, becoming optimum during the late summer months. For this reason, the BSAI
pollock non-roe season was changed by regulation from June 1 to August 15, beginning in 1993. 
To investigate seasonal differences in pollock products, NMFS reviewed data from the 1993 pollock roe and non-roe
seasons, which occurred January 20-March 8 and August 15-September 22, respectively, for the ``offshore
component.'' NMFS also reviewed data from the ``offshore component'' from the 1994 pollock roe season, which occurred
January 20-February 18. These data contained estimates of total retained pollock catches as reported by NMFS
observers and amounts of surimi produced from the retained pollock as reported by vessels. During the 1993 roe season,
20,934 metric tons (mt) of surimi were produced from a retained pollock catch of 134,558 mt resulting in a average PRR
of 0.155. During the 1994 roe season, 23,267 mt of surimi were produced from a retained pollock catch of 144,134 mt,
resulting in an average recovery rate of 0.161. During the non-roe season, 29,878 mt of surimi were produced from a
retained pollock catch of 171,320 mt, resulting in an average recovery rate of 0.17. 
From these data, NMFS has determined that sufficient information exists to demonstrate seasonal differences in
surimi recovery rates. Therefore, NMFS is establishing a standard PRR of 0.16 for the period January through June
and a standard PRR of 0.17 for the period July through December. 
4. The standard PRR for pollock skinless/boneless fillets (product code 23) is revised from 0.22 to 0.21. This revision
is based on results of recovery tests conducted by NMFS observers.
5. The target species category ``flathead sole'' had been proposed to be referenced in  675.20(a), which was
an error. It is now correctly referenced in  672.20(a). 
6. The target species category ``other flatfish'' had been proposed to be referenced in  672.20(a), which was
an error. It is now correctly referenced in  675.20(a). 
7. The standard PRR for Atka mackerel, headed and gutted western cut (code 7) is changed from 0.61 to 0.64, and the standard
PRR for Atka mackerel, headed & gutted eastern cut (code 8) is changed from 0.64 to 0.61 to correct a transposition
error in the proposed rule. 
8. The product codes 95 for discards and 99 for dockside discards have been removed, because they serve no useful purpose.

Section 672.20(j)(3) is revised to limit the aggregate adjustments of any standard PRR during a calendar year that
the Regional Director may make without providing opportunity for prior public comment to no more than 15 percent of
the standard PRR specified for a preceding calendar year. Aggregate adjustments greater than 15 percent may be made
after providing notice and opportunity for prior public comment. 



Comments Received 



NMFS received six letters of comments on the proposed rule. Some comments addressed standard PRRs for specific products
(e.g., surimi and deep-skin fillets made from pollock). Other comments focused on concerns about being accountable
for the standard PRRs that would be different from actual recovery rates. 



Comment 1

. A vessel that achieves an actual recovery rate for a product that varies from the standard PRR could be prosecuted
for violating a directed fishing closure or Vessel Incentive Program (VIP) rate, or be subject to higher fees under
the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan), even though irrefutable evidence existed to demonstrate
that the vessel's actual recovery rate was real. 



Response

. NMFS concurs that a vessel could be prosecuted as stated in the comment. A vessel may have to adjust the amounts of products
retained onboard to comply with the regulations that depend on round-weight equivalents calculated from processed
products. A vessel would not be in violation if it has amounts of products onboard that are consistent with standard
PRRs. Although NMFS considered means by which a vessel could claim it was achieving a recovery rate that differed from
a standard PRR at any particular time, NMFS does not have the ability to determine whether a vessel's claimed recovery
rate was representative of its processing operations or whether it had claimed a particular recovery rate as a means
of justifying amounts of fish onboard to avoid violations of directed fishing closures or VIP definitions, or being
charged higher fees under the Research Plan. 



Comment 2

. A vessel that achieves a higher recovery rate for a particular product receives no benefit under a program that uses
standard PRRs, thereby discouraging the use of more efficient and productive equipment. 



Response

. Standard PRRs are used to determine the amount of fish caught because their use is the best practicable method of doing
so available at this time. Economic incentives outside the regulatory management scheme exist for vessels to increase
their product recovery efficiency. As overall fleet efficiency in producing any particular product increases,
NMFS will revise the standard PRR for that product. 



Comment 3

. By establishing one standard PRR for each product form, the rule ignores seasonal, area, and vessel-by-vessel variation
in actual recovery rates. 



Response

. NMFS has considered variation in determining that standard PRRs are necessary to enforce certain management measures.
Where NMFS has been able to determine a variation in a PRR over a wide area or season, as in pollock used for surimi (See
response to Comment 4, below.), a separate PRR is specified. NMFS does not have the means to account for vessel-by-vessel,
seasonal, and area variations from a standard PRR that may occur at any particular time. 



Comment 4

. Proposed standard PRRs for certain products are inaccurate. These are listed as follows: 

1. The standard PRR for pollock surimi of 0.14 is too low, given that data used by NMFS during the 1992 non-roe season
reflected product recovery from small-sized pollock and that actual recovery rates achieved by vessels, by season,
shows product recoveries that range from 0.12 to 0.30. Data from the 1993 fishery should be a more reliable source of
information; 

2. The standard PRR for deep skin pollock is too low, given that data submitted to NMFS suggest that the standard PRR
is closer to 0.16 or even 0.18; 

3. The standard PRR for headed-and-gutted Pacific cod is too low, given that other sources of published information
indicate that the standard PRR should be in the range of 0.56-0.75 or 0.58-0.64; and 

4. Other standard PRRs may be in error as well. 



Response

. With respect to the standard PRR for pollock surimi, NMFS has reviewed 1993 production information on a seasonal
basis and notes that the average recovery rate for the period January through June is 0.16 (see discussion under the
section on Changes In the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule). The average recovery rate for the period July through
December is 0.17. The final rule establishes these two recovery rates to accommodate seasonal differences. 

NMFS has reviewed information with respect to PRRs for deep skin pollock and headed-and-gutted Pacific cod. Deep
skin pollock is such a new product that few data exist to demonstrate the extent of annual variation. On the basis of
information available, NMFS concludes that 0.13 is an appropriate standard PRR. With respect to headed-and-gutted
Pacific cod, many independent observers' tests onboard vessels have demonstrated PRRs averaging 0.47 and 0.57,
respectively, for eastern and western cut products made from Pacific cod. Other changes made to PRRs are as noted in
the section on Changes In the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule for the reasons given. NMFS does not have information
that indicates any of the other proposed standard PRRs are in error; therefore, NMFS is establishing them as proposed.

Comment 5

. The 15 percent leeway provided to the Regional Director to make adjustments in standard PRRs without further rulemaking
is inadequate. 



Response

. Changes in management measures sometimes have effects that are not anticipated. Notice-and-comment procedures
provide the agency and the public the opportunity to determine what such effects might be. There is no limit to the change
in a PRR that may be made in any one year. The Regional Director may make changes to a PRR without providing opportunity
for prior public comment as long as the aggregate change in any one year does not exceed 15 percent. Changes to a PRR which,
when aggregated with all other changes made during that same calendar year, are greater than 15 percent require notice
and opportunity for prior public comment to ensure that all data and all possible effects are considered. 

NMFS, having reviewed the purpose of this rule and comments received, has determined that it is necessary for fishery
conservation and management. Standard PRRs, rather than recovery rates provided by vessel operators, are necessary
to estimate the round-weight equivalent of retained species: (1) To assign vessels to fisheries for purposes of monitoring
fishery specific bycatch allowances of prohibited species; (2) to monitor vessel compliance with fishery specific
bycatch rate standards set forth under the VIP to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates; and (3) to calculate round-weight
equivalents for purposes of assessing fees under the Research Plan. This rule is also necessary to promote compliance
with regulations that prohibit pollock roe stripping as intended by the Magnuson Act. 



Classification 



The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis as part of the EA/RIR/FRFA, which concludes
that this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA
may be obtained from the Regional Director (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines that arctic peregrine falcons (

Falco peregrinus tundrius

) are no longer a threatened species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. This determination
is based upon evidence that arctic peregrine falcon populations have recovered due to a reduction in organochlorine
pesticides in the environment. Section 4(g) of the Act requires the Service to monitor recovered species for at least
5 years following delisting. This rule includes the Service's post-delisting monitoring plan for arctic peregrine
falcons. Removal of the arctic peregrine falcon as a threatened species under the Act will not affect the protection
provided under the similarity of appearance provision of the Act listing all 

Falco peregrinus

 found in the wild in the conterminous 48 States as endangered; nor will it affect the protection provided to this species
under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The peregrine falcon is a medium-sized brown or blue-gray raptor that preys predominantly upon birds. Three subspecies
occur in North America_arctic peregrine falcon (

Falco peregrinus tundrius

); American peregrine falcon (

F. p. anatum

); and Peale's peregrine falcon (

F. p. pealei

). Only arctic peregrine falcons are included in this rule; American and Peale's peregrine falcons are not affected.
Arctic peregrine falcons nest in the tundra regions of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. They are highly migratory with
most individuals wintering in Latin America, although some may winter as far north as northern Mexico and southern
Florida. 

Arctic peregrine falcon numbers declined in the period following World War II as a result of contamination with organochlorine
pesticides. Organochlorine pesticides, used widely in the United States and other nations in North, Central, and
South America for control of agricultural and forest pests and mosquitos, are stable, long-lived compounds that
persist in the environment. Organochlorines are deposited in the fatty tissues of animals eating contaminated food,
and bioaccumulate in high concentrations in animals near the top of the food chain, such as peregrine falcons. Peregrine
falcons contaminated with organochlorines can die if acutely poisoned, but a serious effect of organochlorines
upon peregrine falcons in North America resulted from sublethal doses of the pesticide DDT. The principal metabolite
of DDT is DDE. DDE prevents normal calcium deposition during eggshell formation, causing females to lay thin-shelled
eggs that often break before hatching. Although organochlorines were not used in areas where arctic peregrine falcons
breed, arctic peregrine falcons were nevertheless exposed to organochlorines because they and some of their prey
species migrated through or wintered in areas of organochlorine use. Arctic peregrine falcon populations may have
declined by as much as 75 percent as a result of organochlorine- caused mortality and reproductive impairment. 

As a result of population declines, arctic peregrine falcons were protected in 1970 under the Endangered Species
Conservation Act of 1969. They were later afforded the greater protection of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 upon
its passage. The Act and its implementing regulations prohibit the take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot,
wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or to attempt any of these), ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. The Act also requires review
of all activities funded, permitted, or conducted by Federal agencies to consider impacts to endangered or threatened
species. As a result of the prohibitions and requirements of the Act, harvest of peregrines for the sport of falconry
was prohibited and peregrine falcon nest sites were provided protection. The pivotal action in aiding the recovery
of peregrine falcons, however, was regulation of the use of organochlorine pesticides. The use of DDT was restricted
in Canada in 1970 and in the United States in 1973. Restrictions that controlled the use of other organochlorine pesticides,
including aldrin and dieldrin, were imposed in the United States in 1974. 

Following restrictions on the use of organochlorine pesticides, reproductive rates in arctic peregrine falcon
populations increased and populations began to expand by the mid- to late-1970's. By 1984, the recovery of arctic
peregrine falcons had progressed sufficiently that the Service reclassified the subspecies from endangered to
threatened (49 FR 10520, March 20, 1984). The number of arctic peregrine falcons continued to increase. In 1991, the
Service announced that it was reviewing the status of the threatened arctic peregrine falcon to determine if a proposal
to delist was appropriate (56 FR 26969, June 12, 1991). On the basis of all available information and the comments received
in response to the notice of status review, the Service proposed to delist the subspecies on September 30, 1993 (58
FR 51035). A summary of the information demonstrating the recovery of arctic peregrine falcons follows. 

Arctic peregrine falcons nest in the tundra regions of Alaska, Canada, and the ice-free perimeter of Greenland. The
exact degree of population decline and subsequent recovery has been poorly documented because most breeding areas
are extremely remote and because there were few population studies prior to the pesticide era, but it appears likely
that the species' population has expanded 3-fold or more since the late 1970's. Counts of the number of pairs found
breeding in one area in Alaska and three areas in the Northwest Territories, Canada (NWT), follow:

<TEXT>
 



Population size has increased in these four areas, although the rate of increase has varied among areas. Long-term,
historical data are not available from other areas within the breeding distribution of arctic peregrine falcons;
however, similar trends have been observed in several other areas for which short-term data are available. The range-wide
population size remains unknown because so few areas have been thoroughly sampled, but certainly the breeding population
now numbers in the thousands. 

Only one local population was known to have been extirpated; this was a small population of about 15 nesting pairs on
the north slope of the Yukon Territory (Mossop 1988). This area is apparently being gradually recolonized by individuals
from adjacent populations (Dave Mossop, Dept. of Renewable Resources, Yukon Territory, pers. comm., 1992). 

Counts of the number of peregrine falcons seen passing fixed points during migration also provide evidence of the
rapid increase in the number of arctic peregrine falcons since the late 1970's. Although some of the peregrine falcons
seen during migration are American peregrine falcons, the majority seen on the east coast and near the Great Lakes
are arctic peregrine falcons (Yates 

et al.

 1988; William S. Clark, Cape May Bird Observatory, pers. comm., 1992; Mueller 

et al.

 1988). The number of migrants seen during fall migration at two well-known concentration areas on the east coast,
Assateague Island, Maryland, and Cape May, New Jersey, reflect the overall growth of the arctic peregrine falcon
population. In the years 1970-1975, the average number seen per year at Assateague Island was about 100; by 1976-1979
the average number had increased to 310; and between 1990 and 1993 an average of 564 were counted (Seegar and Yates 1991;
Seegar 

et al.

 1993; William Seegar, U.S. Army, pers. comm., 1994). At Cape May, the average number seen in 1976-1979 was 136;
by 1990-1993, the average number seen per year was 588 (Schultz 

et al.

 1992; Paul Kerlinger, Cape May Bird Observatory, pers. comm., 1994). Counts conducted at Cedar Grove, Wisconsin,
show a similar trend_the number seen decreased in the 1950's and 1960's, reached a low in the mid-1970's, increased
rapidly in the 1980's, and may now equal the numbers seen in the 1930's (Mueller 

et al.

 1988). 



Review of Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan 



Four regional recovery plans were produced by the Service for peregrine falcons. The Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan,
Alaska Population (Alaska Recovery Plan), was the only plan that established recovery criteria for arctic peregrine
falcons. The Alaska Recovery Plan, while including both arctic and American peregrine falcons nesting in Alaska,
did not pertain to populations outside of Alaska; recovery objectives and criteria for arctic peregrine falcon populations
in Canada and Greenland were never established. This rule applies only to arctic peregrine falcons so only those sections
of the Alaska Recovery Plan that pertain to arctic peregrine falcons are mentioned in this discussion. 

The Alaska Recovery Plan was written in 1982 using the best information then available. It included a strategy for
population monitoring, recovery objectives, and criteria for reclassification. The monitoring scheme proposed
that breeding surveys be conducted regularly in the two areas in Alaska (Colville and Sagavanirktok Rivers) for which
historical population data were available. The Alaska Recovery Plan listed four parameters to be measured in the
study areas to assess recovery status of those populations, and established an objective for each of the parameters.
The four parameters and objectives were:





(1) Number of nesting territories occupied by pairs with an objective of 36 total pairs within the 2 specified study
areas; 

(2) Average number of young per nesting attempt with an objective of 1.4 young per nesting attempt; 

(3) Average organochlorine concentration in eggs with an objective of less than 5 ppm DDE; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941005-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Average degree of eggshell thinning with an objective of shells averaging not more than 10 percent thinner than
pre-DDT era eggs. 




The Alaska Recovery Plan based reclassification criteria upon these objectives. It was suggested that these objectives
should be met for 5 years before downlisting to threatened status, and the parameters should remain constant or improve
during the ensuing 5 years before delisting. 

Recovery plans and objectives are expected to guide and measure recovery, but are intended to be flexible enough to
adjust to new information. Research conducted since the Alaska Recovery Plan was written in 1982 has shown that some
of the recovery objectives were based upon incorrect assumptions. A discussion of the basis of each objective, the
current status of arctic peregrines as measured against the objectives, and a review of recent information pertaining
to the objectives follows: 




(1) The objective of 36 pairs occupying territories in the two study areas was based on historical data and assumed
that there were 51 available territories and 70 percent of these would be occupied in a fully recovered population
(70 percent  x  51 = 36). The plan suggested that 36 or more pairs should occupy territories for 10 or more years
before delisting. Thirty-six pairs occupied the areas for the first time in 1984, and the number has increased each
year since then. Seventy-seven pairs were present in the study areas in 1993, the tenth consecutive year in which this
objective was met. The number of pairs now occupying breeding territories (77) greatly exceeds the original estimate
of the number of available territories (51). 

(2) The objective of 1.4 young per pair was based upon early studies of arctic peregrine falcons. Productivity exceeded
1.4 young per pair for the first time since the pesticide-era in 1982, and averaged about 1.6 young per pair for the 12-year
period of 1982-1993. 

(3) The objective of DDE residues in eggs averaging less than 5 ppm for 10 or more years was based upon the assumption
that arctic peregrine falcons would not reproduce normally as long as residues exceeded this measure (this assumption
was based upon the observation that peregrine falcons in the Aleutian Islands reproduced normally in the early 1970's
when residues in eggs averaged 5 ppm). Average DDE residues declined below 5 ppm in arctic peregrine falcons in Alaska
between 1984 and 1988, but it is unclear exactly when this threshold was crossed. It is therefore uncertain if the objective
has been met for at least 10 years. 

However, it is now apparent that this objective was inappropriate; normal reproduction was occurring for several
years before the average concentration declined to 5 ppm and may have occurred while residues exceeded 10 ppm. The
exact relationship between DDE residues in eggs and reproductive success remains unknown. The Service now believes
that it is most appropriate to gauge ``acceptable'' contaminant exposure by reproductive success. Because reproductive
success has been sufficient to allow population growth since the late 1970's and the objective for the production
of young (1.4 young per pair) has been met or exceeded for 12 years, the Service considers the desired objective for
exposure to organochlorines to have been met. 

(4) The criterion requiring eggshells to average less than 10 percent thinner than pre-DDT era shells was based upon
the observation that Peale's peregrine falcons in the Aleutian Islands reproduced normally with shells 8 percent
thinner than normal in the early 1970's. This assumed that peregrine falcons could not reproduce normally if shells
were more than 10 percent thinner than normal. Subsequent field work has shown this to be incorrect. Although the degree
of thinning has gradually decreased over time, shells collected in arctic Alaska still average approximately 12.5
percent thinner than pre-DDT era shells. Reproduction, however, has been sufficient to fuel population growth since
the late 1970's, and productivity has met or exceeded the stated objective for 12 years. The Service considers, therefore,
that the basic goal that eggshell thinning not significantly affect reproduction, population growth, or recovery
for at least 10 years, has been met. 




In summary, the Alaska Recovery Plan identified four parameters to be measured in two study areas in arctic Alaska
to monitor population health and recovery. Objectives were established for measuring recovery and indicating when
downlisting and delisting were appropriate. The plan suggested that the four objectives were to be met or exceeded
for 5 years prior to downlisting to threatened status and an additional 5 years prior to delisting. Two of the four objectives
have been met for the 10-year interval suggested as a prerequisite for delisting. However, knowledge gained subsequent
to the writing of the recovery plan indicates that the two objectives that have not been met were based upon incorrect
assumptions. The Service concludes, based upon current information, that the basic goals underlying all four objectives
have been reached_the number of pairs occupying territories in two study areas surpassed the objective for the tenth
consecutive year in 1993; productivity surpassed the objective for the twelfth year in 1993; DDE residues in eggs
have not prevented population growth and recovery since the late 1970's; and eggshell thinning has not inhibited
population growth and recovery since the late 1970's.

In the September 30, 1993, proposed rule, the Service requested that all interested parties provide information
and comments on the status of arctic peregrine falcons, on the proposed delisting of the subspecies, and on the draft
monitoring plan included in the delisting proposal. The appropriate foreign, state and provincial governments,
Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and encouraged to comment.
During the 90 day comment period, 39 responses were received by the Service. Responses were received from one Federal
agency, 9 foreign governments, 16 State governments, and 13 organizations or private individuals. No requests for
public hearings were received. Comments concerning the status of arctic peregrine falcons and the proposed delisting
are presented below; comments that addressed the proposed monitoring plan are presented in the Monitoring Plan section
of this rule. 

Of the 39 responses, 24 (61 percent) expressed support for delisting, 5 (13 percent) opposed delisting, and 10 (26
percent) stated no position. Of those expressing support for delisting, 11 (the government of Trinidad and Tobago,
8 State governments, and 2 organizations) specifically addressed the need for the Service to implement the proposed,
post-delisting monitoring plan. Two of those (the government of Trinidad and Tobago and the State of Pennsylvania)
stated that their support for delisting was contingent upon implementation of the monitoring plan. One nation (France,
which governs the colony of French Guiana in South America), three individuals and one conservation organization
opposed delisting. No position on delisting was given by the governments of Canada or Greenland, which are the only
nations other than the United States in which arctic peregrine falcons nest. 


Responses to the Service's proposal to delist arctic peregrine falcons contained several concerns. In some cases,
similar or identical concerns were raised by more than one individual or party submitting comments. Similar comments
have been grouped; the different comments and the Service's response to each are listed below. 



Comment 1: 

Arctic peregrine falcons are still at risk from natural and human-caused factors. Additionally, pesticides, in
low-level concentrations, may interact synergistically with other human-caused or natural stresses to negatively
affect arctic peregrine falcons. 



Service response: 

The Service recognizes that little is known of the effects of low-level pesticide contamination upon arctic peregrine
falcons and the synergistic interactions of pesticides with other decimating factors. However, the Service must
base its decision to list or delist species upon the factors discussed in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''
section of this rule. A species is protected if one or more of the five factors affects its continued existence. Since
the late 1970's, arctic peregrine falcon populations have steadily increased in size, indicating that the cumulative
and synergistic effects of pesticides and other decimating factors have been insufficient during this interval
to threaten arctic peregrine falcons at the population level. The monitoring plan included in this rule is designed
to detect any possible changes in the status of the subspecies following delisting, regardless of what factor or combination
of factors prompts the change in status. 




Comment 2: 

The use of pesticides may increase in Latin America as agricultural development proceeds. 



Service response: 

The Service is concerned that arctic peregrine falcons and their migratory prey are exposed to pesticides during
migration and the winter. Decreasing residues in blood and eggs show that contamination with pesticides is declining,
however, despite continued agricultural development in Latin America. As part of the post-delisting monitoring
effort, the Service will continue to monitor pesticide residues in arctic peregrine falcon blood and eggs so an increase
in contamination can be documented. 



Comment 3: 

The potential for over-utilization of arctic peregrine falcons for falconry following delisting has been underestimated
by the Service. 



Service response: 

Take of arctic peregrine falcons will remain prohibited under the Act in the conterminous 48 States by the listing
of all 

Falco peregrinus 

wherever found in the wild due to similarity of appearance. In Alaska take will be governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act (16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.

). Section 2 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act requires that in adopting regulations for the take of migratory birds,
the Secretary of the Interior is to ensure that take is compatible with the protection of the species. Therefore, take
of arctic peregrines, as with other migratory birds, will be regulated so as to provide for adequate conservation
of the subspecies. 



Comment 4: 

The 

anatum 

Peregrine Recovery Team, Canadian Wildlife Service, expressed concern about harvest for falconry following delisting.
This Team asked that the Service ensure that capture of migrant falcons will not remove birds from breeding populations
not yet completely recovered. They suggested that this could be accomplished by allowing take only on the breeding
grounds. 



Service response: 

Take of arctic peregrine falcons migrating through the 48 conterminous States will be prohibited under the Act due
to the listing of all 

Falco peregrinus 

due to similarity of appearance. Moreover, the management of migratory birds, including arctic peregrine falcons,
is governed in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act provides for the cooperative
protection of migratory bird resources that are shared by the Treaty signatory nations, including Canada. As the
Service develops regulations allowing the harvest of arctic peregrine falcons, the concerns of other nations with
which the United States shares this resource will be addressed. In particular, the Service will work with the appropriate
Canadian officials to provide for the protection of breeding populations that have not recovered to the satisfaction
of Canadian resource managers and recovery teams. 



Comment 5: 

The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission pointed out that the Service was incorrect in stating that arctic
peregrine falcons winter exclusively in Latin America. An estimated 200-300 arctic peregrine falcons over-winter
in Florida each year. 



Service response: 

The Service acknowledges that some of the peregrine falcons over-wintering in Florida are undoubtedly of the arctic
subspecies. The Service has updated its information on the subspecies to reflect this correction.

Comment 6:

 The final rule delisting arctic peregrine falcons should be modified to include those American peregrine falcons
that nest north of 55 degrees N latitude. This is appropriate because the northern American peregrine falcons have
recovered similarly to arctic peregrine falcons. Limiting the delisting rule to arctic peregrine falcons is confusing,
inconsistent, and ignores a large portion of a stable, recovered, and definable population of American peregrine
falcons. 



Service response:

 The Service listed arctic and American peregrine falcons as endangered under the Endangered Species Protection
Act in 1970. They were listed separately, by subspecies, in order to differentiate these subspecies from Peale's
peregrine falcons, which did not warrant or receive protection. Arctic and American peregrine falcon populations
were affected by pesticides differently_arctic peregrine falcons did not decline to the same extent as American
peregrine falcons and they recovered more quickly after the use of organochlorine pesticides was restricted. Additionally,
although the recovery of arctic peregrine falcons appears to have progressed to a comparable degree throughout the
range of the subspecies, American peregrine falcons have recovered to dissimilar degrees and at various rates in
different portions of their range. As a result, the Service is handling the reclassification of American peregrine
falcons separately. 



Comment 7:

 It is difficult to identify subspecies of peregrine falcons in the wild. The conservation of listed subspecies, which
may be confused with arctic peregrine falcons, will be compromised if arctic peregrine falcons are delisted. 



Service response:

 The Service considers all 

Falco peregrinus

 in the conterminous 48 States to be endangered under the similarity of appearance provision of the Act and this consideration
will not be affected by delisting arctic peregrine falcons (see Effects of This Rule section below). This is to ensure
that protection given to American peregrine falcons, currently considered to be endangered, is not weakened by confusion
with members of other subspecies. Although this protection pertains only to peregrine falcons in the United States,
the Service hopes that other nations, where the subspecies ranges overlap, will similarly regard all peregrine falcons
as endangered in order to assist the full recovery of American peregrine falcons. 



Comment 8:

 Delisting will affect international laws and legislation. 



Service response:

 This final rule applies only to United States domestic law. All peregrine falcons are listed under Appendix I to the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Delisting arctic peregrine
falcons under the Act will not directly affect classification of the species or subspecies under CITES. Separate
procedures to delist the subspecies under CITES can be pursued. Such amendments of the CITES appendices are done cooperatively
by the numerous parties to the Convention in accordance with provisions outlined in the Convention's Articles XV
and XVI. There are no other international laws or legislation that will be affected by this delisting. 



Comment 9:

 The opinions of Canada and Greenland, countries principally involved, have not been solicited, considered, or provided.

Service response:

 The Service announced on June 12, 1991, that it was reviewing the status of arctic peregrine falcons and considering
whether proposing to delist the subspecies was warranted. The Service notified the federal governments of Canada
and Greenland of the status review and asked that they provide pertinent information and comments on whether delisting
was appropriate. Neither nation stated a position on delisting but numerous biologists and resource managers within
Canada provided the Service with information on the status of the subspecies in Canada. On September 30, 1993, the
Service proposed to delist the subspecies and again the governments of Canada and Greenland were asked to provide
information and to comment on delisting. The response of the 

anatum 

Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team, Canadian Wildlife Service, stated that ``the proposal to remove the arctic peregrine
falcon from the U.S. list of endangered and threatened wildlife seems well justified by the population increases
and sustained productivity that is documented in the September 30, 1993 

Federal Register

.'' One specific concern was raised (see Comment 4 above) concerning the harvest of arctic peregrine falcons for falconry;
this concern will be addressed by the Service when harvest regulations are formulated under the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act. No comments were received from the government of Greenland. 



Comment 10:

 The data presented in the proposal indicate that populations in some areas have declined for the last two years. The
Service attempted to discount this trend as being the result of ``exceptional years.'' 



Service response:

 Surveys of nesting peregrine falcons at Hope Bay and Coppermine, NWT, are conducted by helicopter at about the time
that falcons in these areas are hatching (Shank 

et al. 

1993). Failed or non-nesting pairs may be absent at nesting cliffs during single, brief visits to cliffs, so may go
undetected in this type of survey (C. Shank, pers. comm., 1992). As a result, annual variation in the number of pairs
counted can be greatly affected by annual variation in nesting success. In years with good success, most pairs have
viable nests and are present when nest sites are checked. In years with poor nest success, many pairs may have failed
by the time surveys are conducted and the adults may go undetected. Annual variation in nesting success is large at
Hope Bay and Coppermine, and is probably caused by the extreme weather conditions found near the coast in arctic areas
(C. Shank, pers. comm., 1992). 

Regression analysis provides a means of detecting and describing trends in the number of pairs found at these areas
despite annual variation. Regression analysis shows that the number of pairs at Coppermine and Hope Bay has increased
significantly since surveys began and that the rate of population growth has averaged about 10 percent per year. Furthermore,
surveys in 1993 showed a slight increase from the previous year at Hope Bay and a substantial increase from 1992 at Coppermine
(see 

Summary

 section above). The Service believes, therefore, that despite several short-term decreases in the number of pairs
detected, local populations at both Hope Bay and Coppermine have shown considerable growth in the last 10 to 12 years.
Furthermore, the Service believes that decreases seen between 1990 and 1992 do not indicate that populations are
declining in either area. 



Comment 11:

 The recovery plan established four criteria to be met before delisting should be considered but only two of the four
currently have been met. The data on organochlorine concentrations in eggs and eggshell thickness (the two criteria
that have not been met) are unpublished and as such have not been verified and validated by scientists. 



Service response:

 As required by the Act, the Service collected all available information on the status of arctic peregrine falcons
before deciding whether delisting was warranted. Much of the available information is unpublished. In using unpublished
data, the Service is able to include the most recently acquired data as well as data collected by a broader array of sources.
The Service recognizes, however, that unpublished data have not been subjected to review by the scientific community.


The unpublished data and the Service's interpretation of that data were presented to the scientific community for
review in the proposal to delist, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 (September 30, 1993). Since the 

Federal Register

 is not widely read among scientists, the Service sent copies to and requested comments from over 30 professional biologists
that have worked with peregrine falcons in Greenland, Canada, and the United States. Additionally, copies were sent
to members of the Western Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team, a number of professional ornithological organizations,
the appropriate natural resource agencies in seven provinces and territories in Canada, and every State fish and
game agency in the United States. Several professional biologists or resource managers expressed support for delisting_none
expressed opposition to delisting. Furthermore, neither the validity of any data contained in the proposal nor the
Service's interpretation of the data were questioned. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



According to the Act and implementing regulations outlined in 50 CFR part 424, a species shall be listed if the Secretary
of the Interior determines that one or more of five factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act threatens the continued
existence of the species. A species may be delisted, according to  424.11(d), if the best scientific and commercial
data available substantiate that the species is neither Endangered or Threatened for one of the following reasons:


1. Extinction; 

2. Recovery; or 

2. Original data for classification of the species were in error. 

After a thorough review of all available information, the Service has determined that arctic peregrine falcons are
no longer endangered or threatened with extinction. A substantial recovery has taken place since the 1970's, and
none of the five factors addressed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act currently jeopardizes the continued existence of
arctic peregrine falcons. These factors and their relevance to arctic peregrine falcons are as follows: 

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.

 Arctic peregrine falcons nest in arctic tundra regions of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. They migrate through the
mid-latitudes of North America across a broad front, but concentrate in some coastal and estuarine areas along the
Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico. Migrants also pass through inland areas including the Great Lakes, Great Plains,
and Rocky Mountains, although the relative importance of coastal and inland habitats to migrants is unknown. Most
arctic peregrine falcons spend the winter in Latin America, but some winter as far north as southern Florida. 
Although the rate of habitat alteration in nesting, migration, and wintering habitats is greater now than in the past,
the rapid increase in the number of arctic peregrine falcons during the last 15 years indicates that habitat modification
does not currently threaten the continued existence of the subspecies.

B. 

Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 Delisting of the Arctic peregrine falcon will not result in the over-utilization of the subspecies for the following
reasons. All 

Falco peregrinus

 found in the wild in the conterminous 48 States are listed as endangered due to similarity of appearance. Therefore,
take of arctic peregrine falcons migrating through the conterminous 48 States will be prohibited by the Act. Additionally,
the take of all migratory birds, including arctic peregrine falcons, is governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
and the corresponding regulations codified in 50 CFR Part 21. Migratory bird regulations allow for the take of wild
peregrine falcons subsequent to obtaining a permit, for recreational, scientific, and educational purposes, but
require that harvest is limited to levels that prevent over-utilization. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 Although individuals may be vulnerable to disease or predation, these factors are not known to affect arctic peregrine
falcons at the population level. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 Arctic peregrine falcons will remain protected by the similarity of appearance provision of the Act while in the conterminous
48 States as long as other subspecies occurring in this area remain listed. This protection will not extend beyond
such time that other peregrine falcons occurring in those areas are removed from the list of endangered and threatened
wildlife. 

Arctic peregrine falcons are also protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which governs the taking, killing,
possessing, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests. A more thorough discussion
of the protection offered by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is included in the Effects of This Rule section below. 

In addition to Federal laws governing the taking of arctic peregrine falcons within the United States, international
agreements govern the transport of arctic peregrine falcons across international borders. The Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is an international agreement that regulates trade in species threatened with
extinction and those that may become threatened if trade is not regulated. The arctic peregrine falcon is currently
listed under Appendix I of CITES, and, as a result, international trade in arctic peregrine falcons is restricted
by the United States and 122 other signatory nations. This final rule only affects United States domestic endangered
species law and does not result in removal of arctic peregrine falcons from Appendix I of CITES. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 There is general agreement within the scientific community that contamination with organochlorine pesticides
was the principal factor responsible for the decline of arctic peregrine falcons. The population decline was likely
a result of both reproductive impairment from sublethal dosage and direct mortality from lethal dosage, although
the relative importance of those two factors remains unknown. Change in population size, therefore, is the best indicator
of the total impact of pesticides because population size is affected by both direct mortality, which is extremely
difficult to measure in wild populations, and reproductive impairment, which is more easily quantified in the wild.
The consistent growth in arctic peregrine falcon numbers since the late 1970's, previously discussed in the Background
section of this rule, provides the strongest supporting evidence that organochlorine pesticides no longer pose
a threat at the population level. 

The use of organochlorine pesticides was restricted in the United States and Canada in the early 1970's. Their use
in Latin America continues, however, and some arctic peregrine falcons undoubtedly winter in areas where organochlorines
are currently used. It has been shown, by comparing blood samples collected during fall and spring migration, that
migrant peregrine falcons accumulate pesticides while wintering in Latin America (Henny 

et al

. 1982). Additionally, some of the avian prey utilized by arctic peregrine falcons during the summer in arctic and
subarctic areas also winter in Latin America. Many of these prey return to their northern nesting areas with pesticide
residues accumulated during the winter (Fyfe 

et al.

 1990). Peregrine falcons preying upon these birds during the summer are thus further exposed to Latin American pesticides.
Pesticide use in Latin America, however, may never have been great enough to cause a decline in the number of arctic
peregrine falcons. The widespread reproductive failure and population crash coincided with the period of heavy
organochlorine use in the United States, and a noticeable increase in productivity occurred in Alaska within a few
years following restrictions on the use of organochlorines in the United States. 

Furthermore, the exposure of arctic peregrine falcons to organochlorines continues to decrease. Average DDE residues
in blood collected from peregrine falcons during spring migration in Texas decreased 38 percent between 1978-1979
and 1984 (Henny 

et al

. 1988). 
Pesticide residues in arctic peregrine falcon eggs have decreased similarly. A sample of eggs from 9 clutches collected
in arctic Alaska in 1968 averaged (geometric mean, wet weight basis) 23.5 ppm DDE with a maximum of 99 ppm (Jeff Lincer,
BioSystems Analysis, pers. comm., 

in litt

., 1992). By the late 1970's to early 1980's, the average DDE concentration in eggs collected from 19 clutches had declined
to 9.3 ppm with a maximum of 46.4 ppm (unpubl. Service data, on file in Fairbanks, Alaska). In 1990-1991, eggs
from 13 clutches averaged 3.3 ppm with a maximum of 5.3 ppm (unpubl. Service data, Fairbanks, Alaska). Similar trends
were observed in Canada. Residues in eggs collected in arctic Canada averaged 9.9 ppm DDE in 1965-1972 (maximum
72.0); 8.5 ppm in 1973-1979 (max. 19.6); and 6.8 ppm (max. 18.5) in 1980-1986 (Peakall 

et al

. 1990). Eggs from 36 clutches collected at Rankin Inlet, NWT, in 1981-1986 averaged 7.6 ppm DDE (Court 

et al

. 1990). Eggs collected in Greenland between 1972 and 1978 averaged 12.8 ppm DDE (Burnham and Mattox 1984), but by 1981
and 1982 the maximum (average not given) in 9 eggs was 9.1 ppm (Mattox and Seegar 1988). To put these values in perspective,
concentrations of DDE in peregrine falcon eggs in excess of 15 to 20 ppm (parts per million, wet weight basis) are associated
with high rates of nesting failure; if residues average less than this critical level, productivity is usually sufficient
to maintain population size (Peakall 

et al

. 1975; Newton 

et al

. 1989). Residues of other organochlorines in arctic peregrine falcon eggs have also decreased since the 1970's,
and residues are currently well below concentrations associated with reproductive impairment or population declines.

Most researchers consider DDE-caused eggshell thinning to be the proximate factor that caused peregrine falcon
populations to decline in North America. Average eggshell thickness decreased by as much as 24 percent in Alaska during
the peak period of organochlorine contamination. This decreased eggshell thickness correlated with greatly reduced
reproductive success. Eggshell thickness has increased significantly since the use of DDT was restricted in the
United States, but pesticides accumulated in Latin America still affect shell thickness. Shells from Rankin Inlet,
NWT, collected in 1981-1986 averaged 15.8 percent thinner than pre-DDT shells (Court 

et al

. 1990). Alaskan shells collected in 1979-1984 averaged 13.4 percent thinner than pre-DDT thickness measurements,
and shells collected in 1988-1991 averaged about 12 percent thinner. Peregrine populations are expected to
decrease in size if eggs have shells averaging at least 17 percent thinner than normal while populations with eggs
averaging less than 17 percent thinning generally remain stable or can increase in size (Kiff 1988). Although arctic
peregrine falcon eggs remain vulnerable to an increase in exposure to organochlorines, eggshell thinning has been
insufficient to prevent widespread population recovery since the late 1970's. 


Reproductive success is another parameter used in measuring the effects of pesticide poisoning upon peregrine falcons.
``Normal'' productivity rates vary among regions; therefore, it is difficult to assess the health of a local population
based upon productivity rate alone. In Alaska, productivity reached its lowest level of about 0.6 yg/pr in the mid
1970's. Productivity improved in the late 1970's, reaching 0.9 yg/pr in 1979. From 1980 to 1993 it varied between 1.3
and 2.0 yg/pr, which was sufficient to support an average annual increase in the breeding population size of about
9 percent (unpublished Service data on file, Fairbanks, Alaska). In Canada, a decrease in the productivity of arctic
peregrine falcons was never clearly documented, although populations decreased in size so productivity almost
certainly declined. At Rankin Inlet, NWT, productivity averaged about 1.5 yg/pr between 1981 and 1992 (Court 

et al

. 1988; C. Shank, pers. comm., 1991, 1992), although annual productivity varied tremendously in response to variation
in weather conditions (Court 

et al. 

1988). Productivity in Ungava Bay, Quebec, reached a low of 1.33 yg/pr in 1970, and exceeded 2.7 yg/pr in each of 3 surveys
conducted since 1980 (Bird and Weaver 1988; David Bird, pers. comm., 

in litt.

, 1991). Reproductive rates have remained high in Greenland since observation began in 1972. In western Greenland
productivity from 1972 to 1992 remained at least 1.80 yg/pr (William Mattox, Greenland Peregrine Falcon Survey,
pers. comm., 

in litt.

, 1992). Similarly, in southern Greenland, production remained high from 1981 to 1991 (Knud Falk, Ornis Consult A/S,
pers. comm., 

in litt.

, 1992). 

The only recent measurable effect presumably attributable to organochlorine use in Latin America has been found
in Rankin Inlet in the NWT. Between 1982 and 1986, pesticides caused about 10 percent of the nesting pairs to fail, but
average productivity within the population was high, and numbers were stable at the extremely high density of one
pair per 17 square kilometers (Court 

et al

. 1988). Despite the effect on a small portion of the pairs, the overall impact to the population in this area was minimal.
There has been no other recent evidence of pesticide-caused reproductive failure found in any other arctic peregrine
falcon population studied. 

In summary, the reproductive failure and resultant population crash seen in arctic peregrine falcons were likely
the result of the heavy use of organochlorines in the United States and possibly Canada. However, arctic peregrines
are still exposed to organochlorine pesticides due to continuing use in Latin America. Because organisms at the top
of the food chain bioaccumulate environmentally stable contaminants, arctic peregrine falcons remain vulnerable
and could suffer from an increase in the use of organochlorines or the widespread use of other stable toxins that affect
survival or reproduction. The concentration of organochlorines in arctic peregrine falcon tissues continues to
decline, though, and is currently well below those levels associated with population declines. The widespread recovery
of arctic peregrine falcon populations is convincing evidence that pesticides and other contaminants do not currently
threaten the continued existence of the subspecies. 


The Service has carefully reviewed all available scientific and commercial data and concluded that the threat or
threats that caused arctic peregrine falcon populations to decline no longer pose a risk to the continued survival
of the subspecies. A widespread recovery has followed restrictions on the use of organochlorine pesticides in the
United States and Canada. This recovery indicates that the subspecies is no longer endangered or likely to become
endangered within the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range. Under these circumstances, removal
from the list of threatened and endangered wildlife is appropriate. 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Service has determined that this rule relieves an existing restriction and
good cause exists to make the effective date of this rule immediate. Delay in implementation of this delisting would
cost government agencies staff time and monies conducting formal section 7 consultation on actions which may affect
species no longer in need of the protection under the Act. Relieving the existing restriction associated with this
listed species will enable Federal agencies to minimize any further delays in project planning and implementation
for actions that may affect arctic peregrine falcons. 


Effects of This Rule 



Pursuant to the similarity of appearance provisions of section 4(e) of the Act, species (or subspecies or distinct
vertebrate population segments) that are not considered to be endangered or threatened may nevertheless be treated
as such for law enforcement purposes of protecting a listed species (or subspecies or vertebrate population segment)
that is biologically endangered or threatened. Under the similarity of appearance provision (implemented by 50
CFR 17.50), the Service must find: 

(a) that the species so closely resembles in appearance an endangered or threatened species that enforcement personnel
would have substantial difficulty in identifying listed from unlisted species; 

(b) that the effect of the substantial difficulty is an additional threat to the listed endangered or threatened species;
and 

(c) that such treatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcement and further the purposes
of the Act.

The Service considers ``all free-flying 

Falco peregrinus, 

not otherwise identifiable as a listed subspecies, to be endangered under the similarity of appearance provision
in the 48 conterminous States'' (49 FR 10520, March 20, 1984). Therefore, arctic peregrine falcons will be protected
as endangered or threatened while migrating through the 48 conterminous States as long as American peregrine falcons
that occur in this area are classified as endangered or threatened. American peregrine falcons are known to occur
or could occur in all areas in which arctic peregrine falcons are found in the 48 conterminous States, so protection
would be complete in this region. The protection of this provision would not extend beyond such time that the American
peregrine falcon is delisted. The Service anticipates that recovery will eventually allow the American peregrine
falcon to be removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife. At such time, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
will govern the take of arctic peregrine falcons, as will the appropriate State regulations. State regulations applying
to falconry currently vary among States and are subject to change with time. The applicable State regulations, however,
may be more but not less restrictive than Federal regulations. 
The similarity of appearance provision does not apply to arctic peregrine falcons while they are outside the conterminous
United States. Although American peregrine falcons occur in northern areas, such as Alaska, there is no overlap in
the breeding ranges of the two subspecies in Alaska (arctic peregrine falcons breed north of the Brooks Range and along
the west coast near Norton Sound whereas American peregrine falcons breed south of the Brooks Range). If this proposal
is enacted, therefore, the taking of arctic peregrine falcons within their breeding range would not be prohibited
by similarity of appearance protection and would, therefore, be governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Additionally,
the similarity of appearance protection is provided by United States domestic law; this protection does not apply
to arctic peregrine falcons outside the United States. 
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act regulates the taking of migratory birds for educational, scientific, and recreational
purposes, such as falconry. Section 2 states that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to determine
if, and by what means, the take of migratory birds should be allowed, and to adopt suitable regulations permitting
and governing the take. In adopting regulations, the Secretary is to consider such factors as distribution and abundance
to ensure that take is compatible with the protection of the species. Existing regulations applying to the use of raptors
for falconry and the captive propagation of raptors are outlined in 50 CFR 21.28 to 21.30. 
In addition to Federal regulations, Alaska State regulations would apply to harvest of arctic peregrine falcons
in Alaska. Alaska State regulations outlined in 5 AAC 92.037 do not currently allow for the use of arctic peregrine
falcons for falconry, but it is likely that State regulations will be amended to allow harvest in the near future. Alaska
State regulation 92.037(b)(3) requires that ``no person may permanently export a raptor taken from the wild in Alaska
unless the person has legally possessed that raptor for at least one year.'' The Service anticipates little or no pressure
within Alaska to amend this latter regulation; therefore, the take of arctic peregrine falcons in Alaska should remain
limited to the roughly 30 falconers who are permanent residents of Alaska. 
Falconry regulations in Canada and Greenland do not allow foreign falconers to take raptors, so this delisting will
not result in United States residents taking arctic peregrine falcons within these countries. Take of arctic peregrine
falcons in Canada and Greenland by residents of those nations is not affected by United States domestic law; therefore,
delisting will not affect regulations allowing harvest in those countries. In addition, as mentioned above, international
trade in arctic peregrine falcons is regulated as a result of the subspecies' inclusion on the CITES Appendix I list.



Future Conservation Measures 


Section 4(g)(1) of the Act requires that the Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and Wildlife Service, monitor
species for at least 5 years after delisting. If evidence acquired during this monitoring period shows that endangered
or threatened status should be reinstated to prevent a significant risk to the species, the Service may use the emergency
listing authority provided for by the Act. At the end of the 5-year monitoring period, the Service will, based upon
results of monitoring efforts, decide if relisting, continued monitoring, or an end to monitoring activities is
appropriate. 
The Service included a draft monitoring plan in the September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51035) proposal to delist arctic peregrine
falcons. The public was asked to provide comments and suggestions for improving the draft plan. Of the 39 parties responding
to the proposal, 15 specifically addressed the monitoring plan, including 11 State fish and game agencies, one Federal
agency, the government of Trinidad and Tobago, and two non-governmental organizations. Of the 15 that addressed
the plan, five supported the plan as written, five stressed the importance of implementing the plan, two stated they
supported delisting only if the monitoring plan was implemented, and three suggested modifications to the plan.
The parties suggesting improvements raised three different concerns; those concerns and the Service's responses
are given below: 


Comment 1: 

The Service has chosen an inappropriate criterion for considering relisting if population size again declines.
Thirty-five pairs found nesting along the Colville River in 1959 should be considered the historical norm for this
population, not 57 pairs found in 1992.

Service response: 

The Service believes that recent survey results provide the most accurate estimate of the number of pairs that will
nest along the Colville River when the population is in a normal, healthy condition. Furthermore, the Service's post-delisting
monitoring plan for arctic peregrine falcons is designed to detect a change in the status of the subspecies. The Service
believes that a significant (25 percent or more) change in population size will indicate that some factor or factors
is affecting either reproductive performance or survival within the population. A change in productivity or survival
will be more quickly detected and accurately measured if recent population estimates are used as baseline levels.



Comment 2: 

The monitoring plan should be expanded to include one nesting area in the Canadian arctic, one nesting area in Greenland,
and migration data from Assateague Island, Maryland, and Cedar Grove, Wisconsin. Cooperative agreements should
be pursued with the governments of Canada and Greenland to ensure the continuation of projects in those nations. 


Service response: 

In formulating the monitoring plan, the Service emphasized breeding surveys conducted in Alaska because surveys
in northern Alaska were designed to measure the criteria listed in the Peregrine Falcon Recovery Plan, specifically,
population size, reproductive performance, and contaminant levels. These factors are the most important in monitoring
the status, trends, and threats to the subspecies, and they are not consistently measured in any other study area in
North America. Additionally, the Service has greater influence over the funding and implementation of monitoring
efforts conducted in the United States, and in particular, those conducted by the Service. 
The Service agrees that continuation of on-going research on arctic peregrine falcons will contribute greatly to
monitoring the subspecies following delisting. In particular, three nesting surveys in the NWT, Canada, and one
in Greenland, and counts of migrants conducted at a number of different sites have provided data substantiating the
recovery of the subspecies. The delisting criteria have been modified to consider information on breeding pairs
gathered in Canada and Greenland. In addition, the Service intends to utilize all available information when reviewing
the overall status of the subspecies, and will encourage the continuation of all research efforts wherever possible.



Comment 3: 

The monitoring plan should be extended to 10 years to allow adequate measurement of the impacts of resumed falconry
harvest, to compensate for short-term variability in productivity due to weather and other variables, and to measure
long-term changes in organochlorine contamination and eggshell thickness. This is particularly important because
the Service reevaluated criteria concerning organochlorine concentrations in eggs and eggshell thickness in the
recovery plan. 


Service response: 

Although two of the recovery criteria in the original recovery plan were reevaluated to reflect current information,
the Service feels that the subspecies has recovered sufficiently to warrant delisting without reservation. At the
end of the minimum 5-year monitoring period, the Service will review all available information, including organochlorine
contamination and eggshell thickness, to decide if continuation of monitoring is warranted for any reason. The Service
believes that this evaluation process allows for adequate consideration of all pertinent factors. 

After consideration of the comments received on the draft monitoring plan, the Service has produced the following
monitoring plan. This plan will be revised, as appropriate, to incorporate new knowledge of threats to the subspecies,
research techniques, or other applicable information. 


Monitoring plan. 

As discussed above, exposure to organochlorines, particularly DDT, was the primary factor causing the decline of
arctic peregrine falcons. Organochlorines affected populations by reducing reproductive success, although the
mortality rate of adults and juveniles may have increased as well. As productivity and recruitment declined to levels
insufficient to replace mortality, populations dwindled. This monitoring plan, therefore, is designed to detect
changes in the status of arctic peregrine falcons by monitoring population size, reproductive performance, and
contamination with organochlorine pesticides and other pollutants. 
In reviewing the status of arctic peregrine falcons and preparing the proposal to delist the subspecies, the Service
relied heavily on data provided by Service biologists. However, information from research projects conducted by
non-governmental organizations and Canadian provincial agencies was also used extensively. The Service is hopeful
that research efforts will continue and that investigators will continue to share data with the Service for management
purposes. Monitoring efforts, therefore, will utilize to the fullest extent possible information collected at
a number of sites by a varie
