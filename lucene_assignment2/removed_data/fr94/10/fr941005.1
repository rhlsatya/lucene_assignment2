OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Federal Employees Retirement System_Computation of the Basic Employee Death Benefit for Customs Officers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations concerning the use of overtime and premium pay
in determining the final annual rate of basic pay of customs officers under the Federal Employees Retirement System
(FERS). These regulations would establish the methodology (similar to the one that OPM uses for other flexible schedule
employees) that the employing agency will use to compute customs officers' ``final annual rate of basic pay'' for
determining FERS ``basic employee death benefit.'' The regulations are necessary to implement the changes in the
statutory definition of basic pay under FERS made by section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, amended section 8331(3) of title
5, United States Code, the definition of basic pay under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), to include, as
basic pay for CSRS computations, certain overtime pay for customs officers. Section 8401(4) of title 5, United States
Code, provides that the CSRS definition of basic pay in section 8331(3) applies to the Federal Employees Retirement
System (FERS). For customs officers, basic pay will include the regular pay under the general schedule, any applicable
locality pay, and allowable overtime pay up to $12,500 per fiscal year. Basic pay is used to compute final salary for
the basic employee death benefit under FERS.



For determining final salary, the employing agency will use a methodology similar to the one used for determining
the ``final annual rate of basic pay'' of intermittent employees for the FERS basic employee death benefit established
in  843.102 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The employing agency will determine the total number of
hours for which the employee was paid two-times-hourly-rate overtime and the total number of hours for which the employee
was paid three-times-hourly-rate overtime during the 52-week workyear ending the pay period before separation.
The employing agency will then determine the amount of overtime pay that the employee would have received during the
52-week workyear if that overtime were paid at two or three times the employee's hourly rate (regular general schedule
pay rate plus locality pay) at the time of death. The amount of allowable overtime is the lesser of the amount that would
have been paid during that 52-week workyear using the employee's hourly rate (times the appropriate multiplier)
at the time of separation or $12,500. The final salary is equal to the allowable overtime computed under the previous
sentence, plus the final annual general schedule pay, plus locality pay. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government
employees and their survivors.

Measurex Corporation, Receipt of 
a Petition for Rulemaking 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Petition for rulemaking; Notice of receipt. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received and requests public comment on a petition for rulemaking filed
by the Measurex Corporation. The petition has been docketed by the Commission and has been assigned Docket No. PRM-150-3.
The petitioner requests that the NRC amend its regulations governing Agreement State regulation of byproduct material
to require Agreement States to notify the NRC of all proposed and completed regulatory actions. The petitioner also
requests that the NRC amend its regulations governing rulemaking to require the NRC to publish Agreement State notices
of proposed and completed rulemaking. The petitioner believes that these amendments would alert NRC and Agreement
State licensees of applicable Agreement State requirements and permit them to more fully participate in the rulemaking
process. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a petition for rulemaking dated April 7, 1994, submitted by the
Measurex Corporation. The petition was docketed as PRM-150-3 on April 12, 1994. The petitioner requests
that the NRC amend its regulations in 10 CFR part 150 that govern Agreement State regulation of byproduct material.
Specifically, the petitioner is seeking an amendment to 10 CFR 150.31 that will require Agreement States to notify
the NRC of proposed and completed changes to that State's regulations. The petitioner is also seeking an amendment
to 10 CFR part 2 that will require the NRC to publish Agreement State notices of proposed and completed rulemaking in
the 

Federal Register

.

The petitioner notes that current NRC requirements contained in 10 CFR 2.804 through 10 CFR 2.807 establish a procedure
for the publication of proposed changes, participation by interested persons, and notification of changes, and
believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures is specified for Agreement States in
10 CFR 150.31. The petitioner claims that the current rulemaking and notification procedure contained in 10 CFR 150.31
fails to provide a mechanism for persons located outside of any particular Agreement State to learn about proposed
changes in that State's regulations. The petitioner believes that the legislative intent of 10 CFR 150.31 is to provide
a mechanism for interested persons to participate in the rulemaking process. However, the petitioner claims that
because there is no current notification procedure required for Agreement States, the petitioner and other persons
do not have ample opportunity to participate in discussion of proposed rules. 

The petitioner states that under both its specific license for device distribution issued by the Agreement State
of California and the general license issued by other Agreement States, it is required to provide generally licensed
device recipients with a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner also indicates that
although it makes a substantial effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC
and Agreement State regulations, it is not always notified of actual changes that may directly affect it and its customers
in Agreement States. The petitioner believes that the proposed amendments to 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 would alert NRC
and Agreement State licensees to all relevant Agreement State requirements and permit them to more fully participate
in the rulemaking process. 

The NRC is soliciting public comment on the petition for rulemaking submitted by Measurex Corporation that requests
the changes to the regulations in 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 as discussed below. 



The Petitioner 



The petitioner is a manufacturer, distributor, and supplier of service for process control sensors used by NRC licensees
throughout the United States. The petitioner states that it and its customers are directly affected by regulations
adopted by the NRC and Agreement States. The petitioner also states that both its specific license for device distribution
issued by California, an Agreement State, and other Agreement State licenses require it to provide generally licensed
recipients a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. For these reasons, the petitioner claims that it
makes a considerable effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC and Agreement
State regulations. 

The petitioner indicates that it is submitting this petition for rulemaking to amend 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 because
it believes that the current regulations completely fail to provide a mechanism for persons located outside any particular
Agreement State to learn about proposed and completed changes to that State's regulations. The petitioner believes
that because there is no adequate mechanism to keep NRC licensees aware of current Agreement State regulations, it
is unable to fully participate in discussion of proposed rules and is often unaware of actual regulatory changes that
directly affect it and its customers in Agreement States. 



Discussion of the Petition 



The petitioner has submitted this petition for rulemaking because it believes that it is adversely affected by the
current regulations that do not provide an adequate mechanism for NRC licensees to learn about proposed and adopted
changes in applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner states that although the current NRC regulations
in 10 CFR 2.804 through 2.807 establish a procedure for the notification and publication of regulatory changes and
participation by interested persons, it believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures
is specified for Agreement States in 10 CFR 150.31.

The petitioner's primary concern is that it and other NRC licensees are not always notified of proposed and completed
changes in Agreement State regulations that can directly affect themselves and their customers in Agreement States.
The petitioner is also concerned that because it is often not aware of Agreement State regulatory actions, it does
not have the opportunity to fully participate in the rulemaking process as is intended by NRC regulations. As part
of its petition for rulemaking, the petitioner has included copies of various correspondence with Agreement State
radiation control boards and the NRC, and cites specific cases in the Agreement States of Oregon and Texas that it believes
will illustrate that the current rules are unduly burdensome, deficient, and in need of strengthening. For example,
in Oregon, regulatory changes are proposed that would eliminate the general license authorizing the petitioner
to install, transfer, demonstrate, or provide service and would require the petitioner to obtain a specific license
from Oregon in order to conduct business. 
If these proposed regulations are adopted, the petitioner states that it will be able to ship sensors to a customer
in Oregon only after confirming that the customer has an appropriate specific license. The petitioner is concerned
not only that the proposed regulations would impose additional burdens and costs on it and its customers in conducting
business in Oregon, but also that it was not provided ample opportunity to comment on the proposed rules or to participate
in the rulemaking process.
Although the petitioner attempted to learn about any proposed or adopted regulatory changes by writing to the Oregon
Radiation Control Section on several occasions between June 1991 and January 1994, it did not receive a response.
The lack of response led the petitioner to believe that Oregon had not modified its 1987 radiological control regulations
even though the current version of the Oregon 

Administrative Rules for the Control of Radiation 

was adopted in 1991. The petitioner stated that it only became aware of the changes in Oregon's notification requirements
in February 1994 when informally contacted by an out-of-state health physics colleague. 
The petitioner also described a case in which it did not learn of regulatory modifications adopted by the Agreement
State of Texas in 1993 until after the rules became effective. These regulations govern distribution and service
involving generally licensed devices. The petitioner claims that the new requirements are costly and administratively
burdensome and again expressed the concern that it was not able to participate in discussions of proposed rules that
affect it and its customers before the rules became effective. 
The petitioner acknowledges that although some State's radiation control agencies are conscientious in notifying
out-of-state distributors or service groups about proposed and completed regulatory changes, many do not make such
an effort. For these reasons, the petitioner indicates that it and other firms have no way of knowing when copies of
a State's regulations are no longer valid and, consequently, have no opportunity to participate in the rulemaking
process. The petitioner stated that its efforts to gain information regarding Agreement State regulatory changes
are costly, time-consuming, and often ineffective. 
To alleviate this situation, the petitioner proposes that 10 CFR 150.31 be amended to require Agreement States to
notify the NRC of any proposed regulatory actions and that 10 CFR Part 2 be amended to require the NRC to publish the Agreement
State notices of proposed regulatory actions in the 

Federal Register

.

The NRC staff would like to inform the readers that 10 CFR 150.31 applies only to 11e(2) byproduct material (tailings
and other wastes generated from the milling of ores primarily for their source material content) and reflects statutory
requirements in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as amended. Similar requirements could
be developed to apply to other byproduct material. In order to avoid confusion with the requirements for 11e(2) byproduct
material, the proper location for these new requirements would need to be considered in the development of any new
section in Part 150. 


The Petitioner's Proposed Amendment 


The petitioner requests that 10 CFR Parts 150 and 2 be amended to overcome the problems the petitioner has itemized
and recommends the following revisions to the regulations: 
1. The petitioner proposes that  150.31 be amended by redesignating existing paragraph (c) as paragraph (d),
redesignating existing paragraph (d) as paragraph (e), and adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: 


Section 150.31 Requirements for Agreement State Regulation of Byproduct Material


* * * * * 


(c) After [date], in the licensing and regulation of byproduct material, as defined in  150.3(c)(2) of this
part, or of any activity which results in the production of such byproduct material, an Agreement State shall require
compliance with procedures which: 
(1) Include the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and 
(2) In the case of rulemaking also include: 
(i) Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, when it proposes to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation,
shall submit notice of the proposed change to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC
20555, Attention: Chief, Docketing and Service Branch. 
(ii) The notice will include: 
(A) Either the terms or substance of the proposed rule, or a specification of the subjects and issues involved; 
(B) The manner, time, and place within which interested members of the public may comment, and a statement of where
and when copies of such comments may be examined. 
(C) The authority under which the regulation is proposed; and 
(D) The time, place, and nature of the public hearing, if any. 
(iii) The notice required in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section will be made not less than [number to be determined]
days prior to the time fixed for hearing, if any, unless the Agreement State for good cause stated in the notice provides
otherwise. 
(iv) The notice and comment provisions contained in paragraph (c)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section will not
be required to be applied_
(A) To interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice;
or 
(B) When the Agreement State for good cause finds that notice and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest, and are not required by statute. This finding, and the reasons therefor, will be
incorporated into any rule issued without notice and comment for good cause. 
(v) The Agreement State shall provide for a 30-day post-promulgation comment period for_
(A) Any rule adopted without notice and comment under the good cause exception in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this
section where the basis is that notice and comment is ``impracticable'' or ``contrary to the public interest;'' or

(B) Any interpretive rule, or general statement of policy adopted without notice and comment under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A)
of this section, except for those cases for which the Agreement State finds that such procedures would serve no public
interest, or would be so burdensome as to outweigh any foreseeable gain. 
(vi) For any post-promulgation comments received under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, the Agreement State
shall submit a statement to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention:
Chief, Docketing and Service Branch. This statement shall contain an evaluation of the significant comments and
any revisions of the rule or policy statement made as a result of the comments and their evaluation.

(vii) The Agreement State will afford interested persons an opportunity to participate through the submission of
statements, information, opinions, and arguments in the manner stated in the notice. The Agreement State may grant
additional reasonable opportunity for the submission of comments. 
(viii) The Agreement State may hold informal hearings at which interested persons may be heard, adopting procedures
which in its judgment will best serve the purpose of the hearing.

Branch. 
(x) The notice of adoption, amendment, or repeal of a regulation provided by an Agreement State to fulfill the requirements
of paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section will specify the effective date and include a concise general statement of
the basis and purpose of the change. Such notice will be made not less than [number of days to be determined] days prior
to the effective date, unless the Agreement State directs otherwise on good cause found and included in the notice
of rulemaking provided in fulfillment of paragraph (c)(2)(x) of this section.

2. The petitioner proposes that 10 CFR Part 2 be amended to add a  2.810 to read as follows: 


Section 2.810 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by Agreement States


(a) When the Commission, in fulfillment of the requirements of  150.31(c)(2)(i) of this chapter, receives
Agreement State notice of a proposal to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation, it will cause the notice to be published
in the 

Federal Register

. The publication of this notice will be made not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time fixed for hearing, if any.

(b) When the Commission, in fulfillment of the requirements of  150.31(c)(2)(vi) of this chapter, receives
an Agreement State statement of post-promulgation comments, it will cause the statement to be published in the 

Federal Register

. 
(c) When the Commission, in fulfillment of the requirements of  150.31(c)(2)(ix) of this chapter, receives
an Agreement State notice of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of regulations, it will cause the notice, including
the effective date, to be published in the 

Federal Register

Communications Disclaimer Requirements

<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Federal Election Commission is seeking comments to help determine whether changes in its regulations governing
disclaimers on campaign communications are warranted. The current rules require a disclaimer notice on communications
by any person that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or solicit contributions,
through any form of general public political advertising. One proposed change would create a presumption that communications
by authorized political committees or political party committees that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate
are express advocacy, thereby triggering the disclaimer requirement. Other modifications would clarify that oral
disclaimers are required under appropriate circumstances; clarify how these requirements apply to coordinated
party expenditures; broadly define ``direct mail'' in this context; require a disclaimer on all communications
included in a package of materials that are intended for separate distribution; and clarify the meaning of ``clear
and conspicuous'' as that term is used in these rules.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Federal Election Campaign Act [``FECA'' or ``the Act''] at 2 U.S.C. 441d(a) requires a disclaimer on communications
by any person that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, or solicit
contributions, through any form of general public political advertising. The Commission is proposing to revise
the implementing regulations, found at 11 CFR 110.11, to address issues that have arisen since the rules were last
amended, and to clarify their scope and applicability.



New Definition



Proposed 11 CFR 110.11(a) includes a definition for the term ``direct mailing.'' For purposes of these requirements,
``direct mailing'' would be broadly defined to include any number of substantially similar pieces of mail, except
for mailings of fifty pieces or less, by any person. The definition would exclude permissible activities by a corporation
or labor organization communicating with a restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 or 114.5, because such activities
do not involve general public political advertising.



Express Advocacy



The current disclaimer requirements were enacted as part of the 1976 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign
Act. They replaced those contained in former 18 U.S.C. 612, a broadly-worded criminal code provision that required
identifying information to be included on any political statement published, mailed or distributed on behalf of
a federal candidate.

The present statutory and regulatory language applies to communications that expressly advocate the election or
defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, a standard the Supreme Court held in 

Buckley

 v. 

Valeo

, 424 U.S. 1, 80 (1976), to be constitutionally mandated for the disclosure of expenditures by individuals and groups
that are not candidates or political committees. 424 U.S. at 80. However, neither 

Buckley

 nor other pertinent case law prohibits the imposition of further requirements on communications made by candidates
and political committees. It is the Commission's experience that an inordinate amount of Commission time and resources
are diverted to the question of whether a campaign mailing or advertisement paid for by a candidate constituted ``express
advocacy'' and therefore required a disclaimer.

Since political committees are in the business of electing candidates to political office, the Commission believes
it is appropriate for them to be subject to a different standard under section 441d(a) in certain circumstances. The
Commission is therefore proposing to include in the regulatory text a presumption that all communications by authorized
political committees, or by party political committees, that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate contain
express advocacy, and thus trigger the section 441d(a) disclaimer requirements. This interpretation would further
a major goal of the FECA, that of more complete disclosure on political communications directed to the general public.
It would also eliminate problems that have arisen in determining whether specific communications contain ``express
advocacy'' in this context.

This presumption would be rebuttable, since certain communications, e.g., those limited to one candidate's placing
a newspaper ad offering another sympathy on a bereavement, are clearly not election advocacy. The Commission welcomes
comments on the advisability of adopting this presumption, as well as suggested alternatives to and/or specific
exemptions from the presumption.

Alternatively, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether the statutory language should be interpreted to
require disclaimers on all communications by political committees, whether or not they include express advocacy.
This, too, would further the disclosure aims of the Act, as well as eliminate possible problems in determining whether
the ``express advocacy'' standard has been met.



Party Political Committee Communications



The Commission is also seeking comments on whether the required authorization statement should be dropped or modified
for communications and solicitations that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate, made by political party
committees prior to the time the party's candidate is nominated. There are several possible approaches to this issue.
One option would be for such communications to state only who paid for the communication. Please note that this would
not change the Commission's long-standing conclusion that such communications may count against the committee's
coordinated party expenditure limits.

If a state or national party committee chooses not to make the coordinated expenditures permitted by section 441a(d),
it may assign its right to make those expenditures to a designated agent, such as the senatorial campaign committee
of the party. 

FEC

 v. 

Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee

, 454 U.S. 27 (1981). The proposed rules would clarify that the disclaimer on a communication made as a coordinated
party expenditure should identify the committee that made the actual expenditure as the person who paid for the communication,
regardless of whether that committee was acting as a designated agent or in its own capacity.



Unauthorized Committee Solicitations That Mention Candidates



While the Act requires communications by unauthorized committees to state both who paid for the communication and
whether it was authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee, the text of the current rule does not include
the second requirement for unauthorized committee solicitations. The proposed rule would clarify that an authorization
statement would be required if the solicitation refers to a clearly identified federal candidate.

The ``Clear and Conspicuous'' Requirement



The proposal would provide guidance on the meaning of the term ``clear and conspicuous'' as that phrase is used in current
11 CFR 110.11(a)(1) and proposed paragraph 110.11(c). The Commission recently completed a rulemaking revising
its regulations on the FECA's requirement that treasurers of political committees exercise best efforts to obtain,
maintain, and report the complete identification of each contributor whose contributions aggregate more than $200
per calendar year. 2 U.S.C. 432(i), 11 CFR 104.7. See 58 FR 57725 (Oct. 27. 1993). For purposes of that rulemaking, a
required notice to contributors is stated not to be ``clear and conspicuous'' if it is in small type in comparison to
the remainder of the material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily overlooked. 11 CFR
104.7(b)(1), 58 FR 57729. This NPRM proposes the same language with regard to the disclaimers covered by this section.



Oral Disclaimers



The draft rules would clarify that oral communications and solicitations must meet the same disclaimer requirements
as their written counterparts. The Act does not distinguish between written and oral communications. The Commission
held in Advisory Opinion 1988-1 that oral disclaimers were not required as part of phone bank campaign communications
with express advocacy content. The draft rules would supersede this opinion. This approach is consistent with the
Commission's recently-adopted ``best efforts'' rules, which require at 11 CFR 104.7(b)(2) that both written and
oral follow-up requests for contributor identification information include a required statement.



Packaged Materials



The proposal would clarify that a separate disclaimer is required on all communications included in a package of materials
if the communications are intended for separate public distribution. In the past, questions have arisen as to whether
a single disclaimer per package would satisfy the purposes of this requirement. All items intended for separate distribution
(e.g., a poster included in a package of campaign handouts) would be covered by this requirement.



Exceptions



The current rules at paragraph 110.11(a)(2) exempt from the disclaimer requirement small items, such as pins, buttons,
or pens; and ``impractical'' items, such as watertowers and skywriting. The Commission is proposing in paragraph
(b)(1)(i) to add to these exempted items checks, receipts and similar items of minimal value that do not contain a political
message and that are used for purely administrative purposes. Also, the question has at times arisen as to whether
the ``impractical'' exception applies to wearing apparel, such as T-shirts or baseball caps, that contain a political
message. This Notice proposes no language requiring a disclaimer on such material. However, if commenters believe
the Commission should consider a disclaimer requirement for such materials, the Commission would encourage suggestions
for practical application of such a requirement.



Disbursements by Candidates or Party Committees for Exempt Activity



The Commission is proposing language that would require a disclaimer on a communication by a candidate or party committee
that qualifies as an exempt activity though on behalf of a clearly identified federal candidate. This would ensure
that a disclaimer is included on all communications, including those which qualify as exempt activities by state
and local party committees or candidates under the Act. See 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(v), (x), (xi), and (xii).

This proposed amendment is consistent with the Act's interest in full disclosure of who authorized and paid for campaign
communications. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach.

Comments are invited on any of the specific amendments discussed above, as well as any related issues that might relate
to this topic.

For reasons set out in the preamble it is proposed to amend Subchapter A, chapter I of Title 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations
as follows:


PART 110_CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS


1. The authority citation would continue to read as follows:





Authority:

 2 U.S.C. 431(8), 431(9), 432(c)(2), 437d(a)(8), 438(a)(8), 441a, 441b, 441d, 441e, 441f, 441g, and 441h.



2. Part 110 would be amended by revising section 110.11 to read as follows:


 110.11

Communications; advertising.


(a) 

Definition

. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section only, ``direct mailing'' includes any number of substantially
similar pieces of mail but does not include:
(1) a mailing of fifty pieces or less by any person; or
(2) mailings by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class
under 11 CFR 114.3 or 114.5.
(b)(1) (i) 

General Rule

. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever any person makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing
a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or that solicits
any contribution, through any broadcast station, phone bank, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility,
poster, yard sign, direct mailing or other form of general public political advertising, that communication or solicitation
shall clearly state who paid for it. If authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate or an agent
thereof, but paid for by some other person, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is authorized
by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent. If not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate
or its agent, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is not authorized by any candidate, candidate's
committee, or agent. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that a communication or solicitation by a political
committee that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate contains express advocacy.
(ii) 

Exceptions

. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to:
(A) bumper stickers, pins, buttons, pens and similar small items upon which the disclaimer cannot be conveniently
printed;
(B) skywriting, watertowers or other means of displaying an advertisement of such a nature that the inclusion of a
disclaimer would be impracticable;
(C) checks, receipts and similar items of minimal value which do not contain a political message and which are used
for purely administrative purposes; or
(D) communications by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted
class under 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.5.
(2) For a communication or solicitation paid for by a party committee pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d), the disclaimer
required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall identify the committee that makes the expenditure as the person
who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated
agent of another committee.
(3) A solicitation other than one covered by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section by an unauthorized political
committee that does not refer to a clearly identified federal candidate need only state who paid for it.
(4) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section, the term ``expenditure'' includes a communication by a
candidate or party committee that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.8(b) (10), (16), (17), or (18).
(c) 

Placement of Disclaimer

. The disclaimers specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner,
to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or committee that paid for, and,
where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is in small type
in comparison to the rest of the printed material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily
overlooked.
(1) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication,
except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face.
(2) Each communication that is included in a package of materials but that is also intended for separate public distribution
shall include a disclaimer.
(d) (1) 

Newspaper or magazine space

. No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent
of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge

 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Directors (Board) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on whether
the deposit-insurance assessment base currently provided for in the FDIC's assessments regulations should be redefined
and, if so, how. Because of recent statutory amendments and other developments affecting insured depository institutions,
the Board believes review of the assessment-base definition is desirable at this time. The FDIC will carefully consider
comments received in response to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) in determining whether revision
of the assessment base is warranted. If the Board finds revision to be warranted, it will propose specific amendments
on which public comment will then be invited.

The insurance premiums paid by an insured depository institution to the FDIC are calculated by multiplying the institution's
assessment base by its assessment rate. At present, an institution's assessment base equals its total domestic deposits,
as adjusted for certain elements. 12 CFR 327.4(b).
Prior to January 1, 1994, the assessment base was defined by section 7(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI
Act), 12 U.S.C. 1817(b). In amending section 7(b) to require the establishment of a risk-based deposit insurance
system, section 302 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) (Pub. L. 102-242,
105 Stat. 2236, 2345) removed the statutory assessment-base provisions. As a result, effective January 1, 1994,
the assessment base is now governed by the FDIC by regulation. At present, the FDIC's assessment-base regulations
continue to be based on the former statutory provisions.
In light of the recent transition to a risk-based deposit insurance system, the FDIC believes that it is desirable
to review the existing assessment base. In the Board's view, it is important to determine whether the existing definition
or some alternative definition more effectively furthers the purposes of the new deposit insurance system. In addition,
a number of other significant developments in the financial services industry in recent years_including substantially
higher deposit insurance rates and the resulting heightened awareness of insurance assessments, significant changes
in the activities of insured depository institutions, adjustments in federal failure-resolution policies, and
Congressional adoption of ``depositor preference'' requirements_also support the desirability of such a review.
Through this Notice, the FDIC seeks comment from all interested persons as to whether the assessment base should be
redefined and, if so, how. The FDIC believes that it is important to review the definition of the assessment base from
as many different perspectives as possible. Accordingly, this Notice poses various specific questions on which
comment is sought. Commenters are requested to identify the question number to which their respective responses
correspond. Questions need not be repeated, and interested persons are invited to respond to as many questions as
they wish. Further, comment is requested on issues not specifically addressed in this Notice but which a prospective
commenter considers pertinent to the definition of the assessment base.
The FDIC will carefully review and consider the comments received in response to this Notice in determining whether
to propose a regulatory amendment redefining the assessment base. Should the Board decide that such an amendment
is warranted, it will issue a proposal to adopt specific changes to the assessments regulations and seek public comment
on that proposal.


II. Background


The assessment base has remained substantially unchanged since 1935. Historically, the assessment base for banks
and thrift institutions has been defined, broadly stated, as total domestic deposits. The existing assessment base,
as defined in 12 CFR 327.4(b), begins with the amount of the ``demand deposits'' and ``time and savings deposits''
reported by an insured institution in its quarterly Report of Condition.
 From these amounts, the regulations provide for additions and subtractions.




Among the additions to ``demand deposits'' and ``time and savings deposits'' are adjustments for unposted credits.
Among the subtractions are adjustments for unposted debits; pass-through reserve balances; a 162/3 percent ``float''
allowance for demand deposits and a 1 percent ``float'' allowance for time and savings deposits; and the amount of
any liabilities arising from depository institution investment contracts under section 11(a)(8) of the FDI Act.





Until 1993, the premium rate by which an institution's assessment base was multiplied to determine its assessment
payment was the same for all banks and the same for all thrifts. Beginning in January 1993, each institution is now assigned
an assessment rate based on the risk that institution poses to its deposit insurance fund.
As assessment rates have risen over the past few years, deposit insurance premiums have become a significant expense
item for insured depository institutions. The expense factor has resulted in institutions and their depositors
questioning the relevance of the existing assessment base in the current environment. In addition, increased rates
have caused some institutions to take deliberate steps to decrease their assessments by temporarily reducing their
deposits at quarter end.

Also in recent years, there have been significant 
changes in the activities of insured depository 
institutions, in terms of reported assets and liabilities as 
well as off-balance-sheet operations (including derivative 
products such as options, swaps, interest-rate and foreign-
exchange-rate contracts). Such changes, which to some extent have eroded the historical connection between 
deposits and lending, give rise to the question of whether 
total domestic deposits continues to be a meaningful 
definition for the assessment base. Other relevant 
developments include adjustments in federal failure-
resolution policies and the adoption of ``depositor 
preference'' requirements. 

This section discusses the applicability of these 
developments to the question of whether the assessment base 
should be redefined. The areas addressed in this regard are 
the role of the assessment base in the risk-related deposit 
insurance system, the assessment-avoidance problem, failure- 
resolution policies, and depositor preference. The 
following discussions on these topics identify what the FDIC 
believes to be important issues that merit careful 
consideration in deciding on an assessment-base definition. 
Comment is requested with regard to how the assessment base 
should be defined in order to address these and other issues 
in an appropriate manner. 

Before turning to these topics, however, the FDIC 
wishes to stress that, in reviewing the definition of the 
assessment base, it is not the FDIC's intent to change the 
total dollar amount of assessments collected. Instead, the 
goal is to select an assessment base that best suits the 
purposes of federal deposit insurance. To the extent any 
decrease or increase in assessment income is warranted, the 
FDIC anticipates that it would achieve that decrease or 
increase by changing the assessment rates, and not by 
redefining the assessment base. In short, the amount of 
total assessment collections a particular assessment base 
definition would yield (assuming no change in the assessment 
rates) is not a criterion the FDIC intends to apply in 
deciding on an assessment-base definition, since assessment 
collections can be fairly readily adjusted by changing 
assessment rates. 

While the FDIC does not intend any redefinition of the 
assessment base to have a significant impact on the total 
amount of assessments industry-wide, there is a potential 
for significant change in the assessments paid on an 
institution-by-institution basis. Depending on the type of 
activities in which a particular institution is engaged, and 
the type of products and services it offers, a change in the 
assessment base could have a significant effect on the 
amount of the assessments it pays. 



A. Risk-Based Assessment System 



Section 302 of FDICIA amended section 7 of the FDI Act 
to require that the FDIC establish a risk-based assessment 
system. Under the system mandated by FDICIA, the amount of 
an institution's assessment is to be based on the likelihood 
that its deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with 
respect to the institution, the likely amount of any such 
loss, and the revenue needs of the insurance funds. Under 
the risk-based system adopted by the FDIC pursuant to 
section 302, the rate component of the insurance system was 
changed from a single, flat rate applicable to all banks and 
a single, flat rate applicable to all thrift institutions to 
a risk-based rate structure. 

Having already addressed the rate component of the new 
risk-based assessment system in previous rulemaking 
proceedings, the FDIC is now turning its attention to the 
assessment-base component. This Notice does not revisit the 
matter of the rate structure. 

At present, the assessment-base component of the risk-
based system remains unchanged from the form required by 
statute for the former flat-rate insurance system. One 
issue to be considered in connection with whether the 
assessment base should now be changed is how and to what 
extent the assessment base should reflect the risk factors 
identified in section 7(b) of the FDI Act, as amended by 
section 302 of FDICIA.

For example, among the risks identified in section 7(b) 
are those attributable to ``different categories and 
concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured * * *.'' 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1)(C)(i)(II).
One area of risk 
taken into account in the existing assessment base is that 
involving deposit liabilities. Potentially, the assessment 
base could be modified to take into account other 
``categories'' of liabilities, such as non-deposit, secured 
liabilities. This example is discussed more fully in 
paragraph C of section IV, below. 



B. Assessment Avoidance 



Whatever assessment base is applied, the FDIC believes 
that, in order to avoid imposing any additional regulatory 
burden on insured institutions, it is desirable to continue 
to collect assessment data from institutions in their 
quarterly Reports of Condition. If the assessment-base 
definition is changed, the information collected for 
assessment purposes by the Reports of Condition might also 
need to be changed. 

At present, the data collected in these reports reflect 
amounts ``as of'' the report date. This has caused some 
institutions purposefully to reduce their assessment 
expenses by temporarily reducing the amount of the deposits 
held on the report date. 

It has been suggested that defining the assessment base 
in terms of a daily average over the quarter (that is, total 
dollars for the quarter divided by the number of days in the 
quarter), rather than actual ``as of'' report-date data, would 
mitigate this assessment-avoidance problem. An averaging 
approach would also help to smooth out the effects of 
unusual occurrences such as misdirected wire transfers and 
the receipt, on or just before the report date, of 
abnormally large deposits to be held only briefly by an 
institution. 



C. Failure-Resolution Policies 



In past years, governmental policies for resolving 
failed or failing depository institutions frequently 
provided protection for liabilities not specifically covered 
by federal deposit insurance. First, through the use of 
all-deposit purchase-and-assumption (P&A) transactions, all 
depositors_insured and uninsured alike_often received 
full protection for their deposit balances. Unlike a 
deposit payoff or an insured-deposit transfer, in which only 
insured deposits were covered (and which were used only when 
there was no acceptable bid for an all-deposit P&A), the 
all-deposit P&A allowed for 

de facto

 100-percent insurance 
protection. The protection of all depositors in the 
resolution of several large bank failures contributed to the 
perception that some banks were ``too big to fail'' and thus 
eligible for 

de facto

 100-percent insurance protection for 
all deposits, both domestic and foreign. 

While the use of all-deposit P&As and application of 
the so-called ``too big to fail'' doctrine often resulted in 
protection for liabilities beyond the statutory limit for 
deposit insurance coverage, in all such cases it did so in 
satisfaction of a cost test or for clear policy objectives 
such as maintaining the stability of, and public confidence 
in, the banking system. Specifically, the FDI Act required 
that, subject to an ``essentiality'' exception, the resolution 
of an institution be no more costly to the FDIC than its 
liquidation. Hence, the FDIC could normally effect an all- 
deposit P&A only if the purchase premium paid by the 
acquirer for the transaction offset the additional cost to 
the FDIC of protecting uninsured liabilities, in comparison 
with the cost of a liquidation. In the handful of ``too big 
to fail'' cases where this cost test was not met, the FDIC 
acted under a statutory exception to the cost test based on 
the ``essentiality'' of the failing institution to the 
marketplace. That exception was used only in a small 
minority of the total number of resolutions the FDIC 
effected.

<PARENT> FR941005-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Still, the 

de facto

 protection of uninsured liabilities 
fueled the argument that such protected liabilities should 
be assessed. Since the assessment base already consisted 
(as it still does) generally of total domestic deposits, the 
universe of non-assessed liabilities was limited to foreign 
deposits and non-deposit liabilities. 

Section 141(a) of FDICIA amended section 13(c) of the 
FDI Act to impose a revised test for failure resolution. 
Instead of requiring that the resolution be no more costly 
than liquidation, the new test requires use of the 
resolution method that is least costly to the affected 
deposit insurance fund. Provisions for present-value 
analyses and documentation are specified in order to 
determine the least-costly resolution method. The FDIC may 
not protect uninsured deposits unless it is less costly to 
provide such protection than not to do so. Further, the 
FDIC is prohibited from pursuing any action, directly or 
indirectly, that would have the effect of increasing losses 
to the insurance fund by protecting foreign deposits 
(generally meaning deposits payable only outside the United 
States). Hence, all-deposit P&A transactions are still 
permitted, provided the insurance fund does not incur any 
loss with respect to such deposit liabilities in an amount 
greater than the loss which would have been incurred with 
respect to such liabilities if they had not been assumed by 
the acquirer. 

The perceived ``too big to fail'' doctrine has been 
replaced by a new statutory exception for situations 
involving ``systemic risk''. In such cases_as determined 
by consensus among the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, and the Secretary of the Treasury 
(in consultation with the President)_the FDIC may take 
action or provide assistance as necessary to avoid or 
mitigate the systemic effects of failure. However, the FDIC 
is required to recover the losses incurred under the 
systemic risk exception through one or more special 
assessments on the members of the affected insurance fund. 
As yet, this exception has not been used. 

The net result going forward is that for any individual 
resolution, protection will be provided only for insured 
deposits unless it is less costly to protect uninsured 
deposits as well. In any instance (expected to be quite 
rare) in which the ``systemic risk'' exception might be 
triggered, the FDIC is required to recover the loss to the 
applicable deposit insurance fund by means of a special 
assessment on the members of that fund. 

It has been argued in the past that the assessment base 
should be expanded beyond total domestic deposits in order 
to conform the base to the actual protections provided by 
the FDIC under the failure-resolution policies. However, 
many now believe that, given the new failure-resolution 
policies, this rationale for expanding the base has been 
weakened. (Of course, a shrinking of the assessment base 
might be viewed as warranted under the failure-resolution 
requirements, or an expansion might be warranted for other 
reasons.) 



D. Depositor Preference 



In August 1993, Congress enacted legislation 
establishing the priority order for payment on claims 
against an institution in receivership. As amended by this 
legislation, section 11(d)(11) of the FDI Act now provides 
for the priority of deposit liabilities of the institution 
over other general or senior liabilities. (Subject to the 
cross-guarantee provisions of section 5(e) of the FDI Act, 
claims with priority over deposit liabilities are secured 
claims to the extent of the security, and administrative 
expenses of the receiver.) This situation raises the 
question of whether, or to what extent, the assessment base 
should reflect the protection granted by this provision to 
uninsured deposits. 



III. Analytical Framework 



A. Evaluation Criteria 



It is the FDIC's intention to apply an assessment base 
definition that addresses the requirements of the deposit 
insurance program over the long run, rather than one 
designed only to respond to the current conditions in the 
banking industry. To this end, the FDIC has identified 
certain characteristics that it believes can be used as 
criteria for analyzing and comparing alternative 
definitions. These criteria, which address the issues and 
concerns discussed in the preceding section, are outlined 
below. They are applied in the final section of this Notice 
as a framework for analyzing various alternative assessment-base definitions.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941005-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the questions at the end of this section, comment is 
sought on the usefulness of these criteria in selecting an 
assessment-base definition, as well as on whether additional 
or alternative criteria should be applied. 



1. Fairness 



This criterion refers to the extent to which 
institutions are neither systematically favored nor 
systematically disadvantaged due to factors such as size and 
geographic location. Under this concept of fairness, 
similar institutions operating under similar circumstances, 
and representing similar risks of failure and magnitude of 
potential loss to the insurance fund, would generally incur 
similar insurance costs. 

Fairness may suggest that claims receiving potentially 
equal protection in the event of a failure be assessed 
equally. Similarly, since there are varying degrees of 
protection for different categories of claims, it could be 
argued that fairness demands higher assessment payments for 
greater degrees of protection. 

Fairness may also refer to the extent to which abnormal 
occurrences, such as the receipt at quarter end of an 
unusually large deposit to be held only briefly by the 
institution, affect the amount of an institution's 
assessments. In this regard, fairness may suggest that the 
assessment base should be defined in terms of averages, 
which would help smooth out the effects of such abnormal 
occurrences, rather than on actual ``as-of'' report-date data. 



2. Measurability 



This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
components of the assessment base can feasibly and 
objectively be calculated with a minimum degree of 
uncertainty and disagreement by separate, independent 
parties (such as the institution being assessed and the 
FDIC). 

For example, an assessment base that is limited to 
insured deposits might raise measurability concerns, since 
timely and reliable calculations of only those deposits (or 
portions of deposits) that actually would be covered by 
insurance in the event of a failure might not be feasible. 
(To the extent measurability is not an issue, the 
recordkeeping necessary to support such a calculation might 
be.) If measurability is a problem here, a possible 
solution might be to identify a ``proxy'' intended to provide 
a less precise (but related) substitute that is more readily 
available than actual insured deposits. 



3. Relation to Risk 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941005-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
assessment base reflects the degree of risk posed to the 
deposit insurance funds. For example, there is a link 
between the existing assessment base, which is based on 
total domestic deposits, and the magnitude of the loss the 
failure of an institution could cause its deposit insurance 
fund. 

On the one hand, private insurance firms often base the 
amount of their premiums at least in part on the amount to 
be paid out under the policy if the insured event 
transpires. This practice might suggest an assessment base 
consisting of insured deposits only. Such a definition also 
would be consistent with the primary purpose of federal 
deposit insurance as clarified by FDICIA_to protect 
insured deposits. 

On the other hand, existing public policy provides 
protection for liabilities other than insured deposits, 
through such measures as depositor preference_which 
provides some protection to non-insured domestic deposits_
and granting superior status to secured liabilities. In 
addition, to the extent that secured claims are elevated to 
a position superior to that of insured deposits, the FDIC 
may be at greater risk of not recovering the full amount of 
its payout on insured deposits. Thus, assessment of 
liabilities other than insured deposits is not inherently 
inconsistent with the concept of defining the assessment 
base in terms of the magnitude of the risk posed to the 
FDIC. 



4. Non-Avoidability 



This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
assessment base precludes or minimizes transactions or 
adjustments made solely to avoid assessments. Under the 
existing assessment base, which is defined in terms of 
deposits held ``as of'' the last day of the quarter, avoidance 
activities usually involve the temporary transfer of 
deposits out of an institution's deposit base for a brief 
period extending over quarter end. 

One such example is the movement of deposits into non-
deposit instruments (such as notes or repurchase agreements) 
within the same institution just prior to quarter end, 
solely for the purpose of reducing the assessment paid by 
the institution. The transferred funds are returned to 
deposit accounts at the beginning of the next quarter, after 
the ``as of'' date for determining the institution's 
assessment base. 

Another example, which involves the transfer of 
deposits from one insured institution to another, does not 
affect the total amount of assessments collected by the FDIC 
but rather forces the receiving institution to pay 
assessments on deposits that would otherwise have been 
included in the transferring institution's assessment base. 
In this example, deposits are transferred just prior to 
quarter end from one institution to another. The transfer 
is reversed shortly thereafter. The result is to 
disadvantage the (probably unsuspecting) receiving 
institution by increasing the deposit base on which its 
assessments are calculated. 

In both of these examples, the result is an artificial 
situation created solely for the purpose of avoiding 
assessments. Such situations could be mitigated by the use 
of ``average'' data in defining the assessment base. 



5. Recordkeeping Burden 



This criterion refers to the ease of maintaining and 
reporting the data needed for computing an institution's 
assessment base. It encompasses the time and effort 
necessary for any additional recordkeeping beyond that 
required of reporting entities for purposes other than 
assessments.

<PARENT> FR941005-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The FDIC fully appreciates the need to keep to a 
minimum any additional recordkeeping requirements. However, 
pursuant to section 7(b)(5) of the FDI Act, as amended by 
FDICIA, each insured depository institution must maintain 
all records the FDIC may require for verifying the 
correctness of the institution's assessments. Depending on 
how the assessment base is defined, additional recordkeeping 
might be necessary to allow for the verification of the 
assessment-related information reported by an institution. 

If, in responding to any portion of this Notice, a 
comment recommends a particular recordkeeping requirement, 
the commenter is requested to include an estimate of the 
amount of time it would take a reporting entity to meet the 
requirement. 



B. Questions for Comment Regarding the Criteria 



Response to the following questions is requested: 

1. Are the definitions of the aforementioned criteria 
sufficient in terms of evaluating the various options for 
defining the assessment base? If not, provide suggested 
definitions. 

2. Are there any other criteria that should be 
considered in evaluating the various options for defining 
the assessment base? If so, identify and define those 
criteria. 



IV. Alternative Assessment-Base Definitions 



This section presents several options for defining the 
assessment base. It does not attempt to address all 
possible options, but rather discusses those the FDIC has 
identified to date as the primary alternatives. 

Following a discussion of each of these options are 
several specific questions pertaining to that option. 
Response to these questions is requested from all interested 
persons. 



A. Status Quo 



Under this option, the assessment base would remain 
unchanged, and it would continue to be defined, broadly 
stated, as total domestic deposits. Because there would be 
no changes, the FDIC's existing assessment-base regulations 
would not be amended.

Retaining the existing definition would avoid another 
regulatory change for insured depository institutions. The 
existing definition is generally well understood and 
operable, and has relatively few measurement problems. 
However, because quarter-end data are used to calculate the 
current assessment base, there is a high risk of assessment 
avoidance, and the problem of receiving abnormally large 
deposits or misdirected wire transfers at quarter end would 
not be addressed. 

Relative to assessable deposits, there has been recent 
growth of other liabilities and off-balance-sheet 
activities. If this is a long-term trend, it might not be 
desirable to link assessments to a base that may be 
shrinking in relation to overall banking activity unless the 
protection provided in connection with the federal deposit 
insurance program is reduced commensurately. 

Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of 
this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of 
the following criteria discussed in section III of this 
Notice: 




3. Fairness 

4. Measurability 

5. Relation to Risk 

6. Non-Avoidability 

7. Recordkeeping Burden 

8. Any other criteria suggested by the commenter. 




Commenters are also requested to respond to the 
following specific questions regarding this option: 

9. Should the float deductions be retained at their 
existing levels, or should they be modified? (The deduction 
for adjusted demand deposits is 162/3 percent and the 
deduction for adjusted time and savings deposits is 1 
percent.) State the advantages and disadvantages of the 
recommended method for addressing the float deduction for 
the status quo option. 

10. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this 
option for defining the assessment base. 



B. Total Unadjusted Domestic Deposits 



Under this option, the assessment base would be defined 
in its existing form (status quo), except that current 
assessment base adjustments would be eliminated. The float 
deductions, which were established over 30 years ago, are 
the most significant adjustments to the assessment base 
provided for in the current regulations. Since that time, 
there have been dramatic changes in the payments system in 
the United States that may have caused the current float 
deductions to become obsolete. Therefore, many advocate the 
elimination of these float deductions. 

The other existing adjustments to the assessment base 
have a less dramatic effect on the total assessments paid by 
institutions. However, these adjustments complicate the 
measurability of the assessment base and increase the 
reporting and recordkeeping burden.

currently provided for be eliminated (such as ``BICs'' and 
pass-through reserve balances)? State the advantages and

19. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this 
option for defining the assessment base. 



C. Expanded Base: Non-Deposit Secured Liabilities 



Under this option, the assessment base would consist, 
in general terms, of total adjusted domestic deposits plus 
non-deposit secured liabilities (such as secured notes and 
other secured borrowings). One argument given for assessing 
secured liabilities is that they are protected before the 
FDIC in the event of a failure and, accordingly, increase 
the risk of loss to the FDIC. 

Secured creditors of insured depository institutions 
are protected against loss by assets of the institution that 
are pledged as security for its debts to those creditors. 
Because more favorable terms can be obtained on borrowings 
by pledging high-quality, marketable assets as security, 
there is a tendency for institutions to pledge such assets 
for that purpose. If the institution were to fail, these 
pledged assets would not be available to reduce the FDIC's 
losses or to settle the claims of other unsecured creditors. 
As more of the institution's assets are pledged_often, 
the highest-quality, most marketable assets_there are 
fewer assets remaining to satisfy unsecured obligations, 
including unsecured deposit and non-deposit liabilities. 

The likely effect of a shrinking pool of quality assets 
on the FDIC is to increase its failure-resolution costs. 
FDIC costs could be increased even further if, as is often 
the case, the market realizes beforehand that an institution 
may be heading toward insolvency. Uninsured and unsecured 
creditors typically flee an institution perceived to be in 
trouble, leaving the institution more dependent on secured 
borrowings for funding, and further depleting the pool of 
unpledged assets available for settling claims. 

FDICIA allows secured claims to be paid up to the fair 
market value of the assets pledged against those claims. 12 
U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(D). Any remaining portion is to be 
treated as an unsecured claim. This marginally reduces the 
FDIC's exposure by restricting secured claimholders' 
recoveries to the market value of the pledged assets, but by 
no means eliminates the exposure. 

If the assessment base were expanded to include secured 
liabilities, a better measure of these liabilities would be 
necessary. While rough estimates of secured liabilities are 
obtainable, an institution's secured, non-deposit borrowings 
cannot at present be readily determined from data available 
in the institution's Report of Condition. As a result, if 
the assessment base were defined to include non-deposit 
secured liabilities, additional data (and additional 
recordkeeping) would probably be required.

D. Expanded Base: Foreign Deposits 



Under this option, the assessment base would equal, in general terms, total adjusted domestic deposits plus foreign
deposits. Despite the fact that obligations payable only outside the United States and certain other limited areas
(including ``foreign deposits'') are not covered by federal deposit insurance, they have sometimes been protected
in the past by federal failure-resolution policies. Since virtually all foreign deposits are held by large banks
and since large-bank failures historically have been handled in a way that protected most depositors, it has been
argued that these deposits should be assessed. Those who support this argument believe that assessing foreign deposits
would help to equalize a perceived inequality in treatment between large and small depository institutions. 

However, recent changes in the failure-resolution process have eroded this argument. Under FDICIA, protection
of uninsured deposits, including foreign deposits, is permitted only in cases where a least-cost determination
warrants such protection or where the systemic-risk exception is triggered. In cases falling within the systemic-risk
exception (which are expected to be quite rare), FDICIA requires special assessments on the members of the affected
insurance fund to cover the costs of protecting any uninsured deposits. (The statute requires the special assessment
without reference to the fund's resources; thus, whether or not foreign deposits are included in the assessment base
is totally irrelevant to the applicability of the special assessment, which is apparently intended to be imposed
on all members of the affected fund.) 

Another possible argument for assessing foreign deposits is to offset any losses resulting from a foreign government's
seizure of failed U.S. institutions' assets located within the jurisdiction of that foreign government. While the
possible seizure of assets by a host country is a risk that should not be overlooked, neither should it be exaggerated.
In the event of such a failure, it is not clear who would control the liquidation of foreign-branch assets. 

Increased costs associated with assessing foreign deposits could reduce the ability of U.S. depository institutions
to compete in foreign and international markets and could adversely affect their ability to promote exports from
the United States. There is reason to believe that assessment of foreign deposits would cause many depository institutions
to convert their foreign offices to subsidiary depository institutions, thus perhaps substantially reducing the
amount of foreign deposits subject to assessment. 

Moreover, many would argue that if foreign deposits are assessed, they should also be insured. At present, federal
statute explicitly precludes the insurance coverage of foreign deposits. A change in this situation would require
Congressional action and would raise a variety of issues, including the reaction of foreign governments to U.S. depository
institutions offering insured deposits in competition with that country's domestic depository institutions.

33. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this option for defining the assessment base. 



E. Expanded Base: Total Liabilities 



Under this option, the assessment base would equal total liabilities (domestic and foreign).
 An argument can be made for an assessment-base definition that is based on all of an institution's funding sources
(e.g., total liabilities, not including capital) as opposed to deposits alone. As an institution encounters difficulties,
a ``flight to quality'' often occurs, with uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors leaving the institution.
In turn, fewer depositors and other creditors are actually unprotected, or face losses, at the time of failure. As
a result, as assets are liquidated to fund the withdrawal of uninsured deposits, this flight to quality reduces the
amount of unpledged assets that are available for settling claims, which increases the FDIC's resolution costs.
This argues for assessing institutions' liabilities that are protected directly by deposit insurance (insured
deposits), as well as indirectly (uninsured deposits and secured liabilities), in the event of a failure. 





FDIC experience with depository institution failures supports the premise that all types of an institution's liabilities
are used to fund the activities that cause depository institution failures and, thereby, produce losses for the FDIC.
Given this situation, it has been suggested that all of a depository institution's liabilities should be assessed
by the FDIC. This would also remove any artificial incentives for institutions to favor certain types of liabilities
(e.g., non-deposits) over other types of liabilities (e.g., deposits) for purposes of assessment avoidance.

35. Measurability 

36. Relation to Risk 

37. Non-Avoidability 

38. Recordkeeping Burden 

39. Any other criteria suggested by the commenter. 





Commenters are also requested to respond to the following specific question regarding this option: 





40. Identify any other advantages or disadvantages of this option for defining the assessment base. 



F. Insured Deposits Only 



Under this option, the assessment base would equal insured deposits only. To the extent that protection of obligees
in the event of an institution failure is limited to insured deposits, this definition would provide a balance between
protection and assessment. However, to the extent non-insurance protection is given to non-insured liabilities,
that balance is undermined. 

The potential risk to the FDIC from non-insured liabilities of a depository institution, such as secured borrowings,
would be disregarded under this option. In addition, other protected obligations, such as uninsured deposits potentially
sheltered by depositor preference, would not be assessed. With regard to uninsured deposits, one might argue that
the protection they receive is provided at no cost or risk to the deposit insurance funds, and that such a risk comes
only from insured deposits and secured liabilities. Others might argue that they all fall within the scope of the protection
provided by the ``federal safety net'' and that such protection should somehow be taken into account in determining
an institution's deposit insurance premiums. 

Whatever the merits of these arguments might be, coming up with a timely and accurate figure for only that portion of
an institution's deposits that actually would be covered by deposit insurance were the institution to fail may pose
significant reporting problems. For example, concerns have been expressed regarding the difficulty of compiling
data that accurately distinguish between insured and uninsured deposits. 

At present, the Reports of Condition require data indicating the total amount of the institution's deposits and its
uninsured deposits. However, the report formula for computing uninsured deposits results in estimated amounts
and may not be sufficiently precise for purposes of determining an institution's assessment base. Providing an acceptable
level of precision may require an institution to increase its data collection and analysis efforts, resulting in
increased regulatory burden.

47. In order to alleviate any additional reporting

deposits under this option, would it be desirable to develop 
a ``proxy'' for insured deposits for assessment purposes? If 
so, what would be an acceptable method of approximation? 

48. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this 
option for defining the assessment base. 



G. Assessment Base of Total Assets 



Under this option, the assessment base would equal an 
institution's total assets. Conceptually, an argument can 
be made for charging premiums against those items which pose 
a risk of loss to the deposit insurance funds, such as an 
institution's assets. 

An assessment base defined in terms of assets might be 
more easily understood and less prone to manipulation for 
assessment-avoidance purposes than liability-based measures. 
Based on Report of Condition data, it could be easily 
measured and perhaps more predictable than a deposit-based 
definition. It also would insulate the assessment base from 
liability-structure decisions of the institution, creating 
an assessment base that is neutral with respect to an 
institution's liabilities. Because all assets would be 
included in the base, this definition also could reduce the 
risk of assessment avoidance. 

While conceptually appealing, this approach would be a 
substantial departure from tradition, and there would be no 
direct relationship between those items assessed and those 
items insured. 

Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of 
this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of 
the following criteria discussed earlier in section III of 
this Notice:

52. Non-Avoidability 
53. Recordkeeping Burden 
54. Any other criteria suggested by the commenter. 




Commenters are also requested to respond to the 
following specific questions regarding this option: 

55. As discussed in this section, there can be 
advantages to an assessment base founded on assets. 
However, given that numerically, total liabilities is 
equivalent to total assets, net of equity, what would be the 
advantages and disadvantages of using total assets, net of 
equity, instead of total liabilities, to define the 
assessment base? 

56. Would an assessment base defined in terms of 
assets be more reflective of risk to the deposit insurance 
funds, and, if so, how?

V. Miscellaneous Requests for Comment 



In addition to the comments requested elsewhere in this 
Notice, response to the following questions is invited: 

58. Should the assessment base be calculated using 
daily average data for the quarter (total dollars for the 
quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter), 
rather than ``as-of'' quarter-end data? What are the 
advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches? 
Are there preferable alternative approaches, and if so, what 
are they and what are their advantages and disadvantages? 

59. If daily averages over the quarter were used, what 
additional recordkeeping would be necessary for the 
institution? (Please describe and quantify.) 

60. To what extent, if any, should off-balance-sheet 
items be factored into the assessment base? 

61. If the assessment base is redefined, is there a 
need for a transition period from application of the 
existing base to application of the new base? If so, how 
should the transition period be implemented and how long 
should it be? 

62. Should there be an assessment base for large 
institutions and a different assessment base for small 
institutions? If so, what should the respective assessment 
bases be? How should ``large institution'' and ``small 
institution'' be defined for this purpose? 

63. What are the implications (if any) of a change in 
the assessment base on the ability of insured depository 
institutions to innovate and to keep up with changes in the 
marketplace? 

64. Since there are varying degrees of protection for 
different types of claims resulting from a depository 
institution failure, would ``fairness'' require that there be 
some mechanism in the assessment system for adjusting 
assessments to correspond to the degree of protection 
provided? If so, what should that mechanism be? 

65. Are there other desirable options for defining the 
assessment base, including modifications to the options 
presented in this Notice? If so, identify and explain the 
options and describe their advantages and disadvantages. 

66. What would be the impact of a change in the 
definition of the assessment base on competition within the 
United States? Describe the impact on domestic competition 
relative to the assessment base options discussed in 
section IV and any additional options suggested by the 
commenter. 

67. What would be the impact of a change in the 
definition of the assessment base on global competition, 
particularly with regard to foreign deposits? Describe the 
impact on global competition relative to the assessment base 
options discussed in section IV and any additional options 
suggested by the commenter. 

68. Please provide any other comments regarding the 
assessment base.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations 
pertaining to Customs field organization by establishing a new 
port of entry in the Customs District of Chicago, Illinois, North Central Region. The new port of entry would be designated
as 
Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport, 
which is currently operated as a user-fee airport. This change 
will assist the Customs Service in its continuing efforts to 
achieve more efficient use of its personnel, facilities, and 
resources, and to provide better service to carriers, importers, 
and the general public.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


To achieve more efficient use of its personnel, facilities, and resources, and in order to provide better service
to carriers, importers and the public in the North Central Region, Customs proposes to amend  122.15, Customs
Regulations (19 CFR 122.15), by removing Greater Rockford Airport from the list of user-fee airports and  101.3,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 101.3) to add Rockford, Illinois, as a port of entry. The new port would be designated as
Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport. 
The criteria used by Customs in determining whether to establish a port of entry are found in T. D. 82-37 (47 FR
10137), as revised by T. D. 86-14 (51 FR 4559) and T. D. 87-65 (52 FR 16328). Under these criteria, a community
requesting a port of 
entry designation must: 
(1) Demonstrate that the benefits to be derived justify the Federal Government expense involved; 
(2) Be serviced by at least two major modes of transportation (rail, air, water or highway); 
(3) Have a minimum population of 300,000 within the immediate service area (approximately a 70 mile radius); and 
(4) Make a commitment to make optimal use of elect
