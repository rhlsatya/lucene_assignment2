<DOCTITLE>Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Clear Creek Skiing Corporation's Revised Master Development
Plan; Arapaho National Forest; Loveland Basin and Loveland Valley Ski Areas; Clear Creek County, CO</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland is proposing to determine whether to approve
a revision to the Master Development Plan for Loveland Basin and Loveland Valley Ski areas. The revision is to the Master
Development Plan that was approved by the Forest Service on March 1, 1997. Loveland Basin and Loveland Valley ski areas
are operated by Clear Creek Skiing Corporation and located entirely on National Forest System lands. Clear Creek
Corporation was issued a 40-year permit on January 26, 1994 that included a clause requiring them to complete the Master
Development Plan within 5 years.


The Master Development Plan revision includes new skiing terrain, two new lifts, additional parking, upgraded base
area facilities, lift replacements, additional snowmaking lines, and a backcountry ski touring area.
The purpose of the actions proposed by Clear Creek Skiing Corporation is to provide the highest quality skiing experience
by providing a wide variety of skiing experience, quality base area facilities, and balanced capacities. Some of
the lifts at the ski areas are twenty years old or older and in need of replacement. The existing condition indicates
a large imbalance of excess trail capacity over lift capacity.
The replacement of several lifts with fixed-grip quad chairs will allow for greater life capacities. The addition
of two new lifts, and the addition of new skiing terrain will allow a diversity of experience for beginner, intermediate
and expert skiers. Additional snowmaking lines will allow for the coverage of high wear areas and for opening the ski
areas early to accommodate large crowds during the holidays. Many of the facilities at the ski areas are in need of renovation
and expansion to accommodate expected growth.
The proposed action at Loveland Basin ski area is to (1) Replace three lifts with fixed-grip quad chairs, remove a poma
lift, add a new lift to access 75 acres of difficult and extreme skiing; (2) Glade terrain to add 18 acres of additional
skiing; (3) Add approximately 4,500 linear feet of subgrade piping for snowmaking under two chairlifts. No additional
water diversion is required; (4) Replace, renovate and/or add to existing facilities including ticket office, rental
and repair shop, retail sales and storage, and improvement of entry and skier plaza.
The proposed action at Loveland Valley ski area is to (1) Replace one lift with a fixed-grip quad and add a new fixed-grip
quad; (2) Add 71 acres of new terrain for easy and more difficult skiing; (3) Add snowmaking lines to cover 45 acres of
the new terrain; (4) Add a ticketing and restroom facilities near the proposed new lift and an addition to the existing
lodge for daycare and additional restaurant seating; (5) Add a 500-car parking lot above the existing eastern parking
lot.
Also proposed is providing guided backcountry skiing into the east face of Mount Trelease, adjacent to Loveland Basin
ski area, located outside of the permit boundary but in an area designated as 1-B-2 which provides for potential
winter sports sites in the Arapaho and Roosevelt and Pawnee National Grasslands Forest Plan of 1984.
The purpose of the Environmental Impact Statement is to determine the environmental effects of the proposed action
and of any reasonable alternative actions that would also achieve the purpose and need while addressing significant
issues raised through public comment and agency review.
The purpose of this Notice is to inform you that the Forest Service, with the assistance of a third party contractor,
is soliciting your comments and concerns about this proposed action.
The environmental analysis and decision-making process will include opportunities for public participation and
comment so that people interested in this proposal may contribute to the final decision.
The Forest Service is now seeking written comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. Comments relevant
to scoping include: (1) Identifying potential issues, (2) identifying those issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating
insignificant issues, (4) identifying additional alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered;
(5) identifying potential environmental effects on the proposed action and alternatives. General notice to the
public concerning the scope of the analysis will be provided by mailings, news releases and a field trip.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Loveland Basin and Loveland Valley ski areas have operated under special use permit since 1937 on National Forest
System lands administered by the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests. The permit covers 2,300 acres of National
Forest System land, the area where these projects are proposed.




The ski areas operate in accordance with the Master Development Plan that was approved by the Forest Service on March
1, 1977. Specific operations on National Forest Service lands are authorized under a special use permit issued by
the Forest Service on January 26, 1994.

The proposed action is consistent with the long-range goals for this area as defined in the Land and Resource Management
Plan for the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland, approved on May 4, 1984. Under
that Forest Plan, the area encompassed by Loveland Basin and Loveland Valley ski areas is assigned to management under
prescription 1B-1. This management prescription provides management emphasis for the provision of downhill
skiing on existing downhill sites. The purpose of prescription 1B-1 is to integrate ski area development and
use with other resource management to provide healthy tree stands, vegetative diversity, forage production for
wildlife and livestock, and opportunities for nonmotorized recreation.

The proposed area for guided backcountry skiing, adjacent to Loveland Basin ski area, is assigned to management under
prescription 1B-2. This management prescription provides for potential winter sports sites. The purpose
of prescription 1B-2 is for these sites to be maintained for future downhill skiing recreation opportunities
and recreation opportunities focus on dispersed recreation uses. Vegetation treatment focuses on perpetuating
a healthy forest. The Forest Service does not anticipate the need for any amendments to the Land and Resource Management
Plan as a result of this proposal.

A range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action will be considered in the analysis. Reasonable alternatives
are those which fulfill the purpose and need for the proposals and address significant issues that are identified
during the scoping process. The only specific alternative that has been identified at this time is the ``no action''
alternative. If the ``no action'' alternative is selected, the proposed project would not take place at this time.

The analysis will address major issues and concerns about the proposed action and alternatives and will disclose
the direct and indirect impacts related to those issues. The following tentative issues have been identified: (1)
Impacts to wetlands and floodplains; (2) Impacts to water quality; (3) Impacts to threatened and endangered species;
(4) Impacts to visual quality; (5) Impacts to downhill skiers.

It is anticipated that the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be published by November 30, 1994. The Final
Environmental Impact Statement will be completed in March, 1995.

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft Environmental Impact
Statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp

 v. 

NRDC

 435 US 519, 533 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the Final Environmental Impact Statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel

 (9th Circuit, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the Final
Environmental Impact Statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council of Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<DOCTITLE>Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project, Tahoe National Forest, Sierra County, CA</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Tahoe National Forest will prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) for proposed watershed restoration, timber salvage, fuels reduction, wildlife habitat improvement,
and reforestation activities within the xx,xxx-acre Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project analysis area located
in the Feather River and Truckee River watersheds. The project area is located within all or portions of T19N, R15 &
16E, T20N, R15, 16, & 17E; and T21N, R15, 16, and 17E, MDB&M.


The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the
full environmental analysis and decision-making process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected
people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A Notice of Intent to prepare the Eastside Forest Restoration Project EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 16, 1994 [59 FR 25440-25441]. That 85,000-acre project was proposed to address the area's extensive tree
mortality and overstocked timber stands. Opportunities were identified to treat those stands in order to improve
forest health and reduce the fire hazard, while concurrently accomplishing watershed restoration and wildlife
habitat improvement goals.


Significant new circumstances have occurred that bear on the original proposal. From August 16 through August 31,
1994, the 48,000-acre Cottonwood Fire burned through the Eastside Forest Restoration Project analysis area, affecting
about 36,300 acres of National Forest System land and 11,700 acres of lands of other ownership on both the Tahoe and
Toiyabe National Forests.
The fire burned with high-to-moderate intensity on over 90 percent of the affected area, leaving only skeletons of
burned trees and shrubs. Less than 10 percent of the area burned with low intensity, leaving partially burned or scattered
live trees. This loss of vegetation has resulted in large areas of exposed soils and, thus, unstable watershed conditions,
large amounts of new fuels, and the loss of standing timber and future timber growth potential. The fire also affected
other important resources, such as wildlife habitat, recreation sites, visual quality, historic and pre-historic
sites, fisheries, sensitive plant and animal species, and water quantity and quality.
The unburned portion (about xx,xxx acres) of Eastside Forest Restoration Project EIS is being deferred for analysis
until the completion of the Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project EIS; a revised Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement for the remaining area, along with new time schedules, will be placed in the 

Federal Register

 at a later date.
The Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project analysis area is about xx,xxx acres in size, and includes xx,xxx acres of
National Forest System lands and xx,xxx acres of lands of other ownerships. Most of the area is in the Feather River
watershed, with a small portion in the Truckee River watershed. It is located east of the town of Sierraville and Highway
89, north of Sardine Peak and Lewis Mill, west of Babbitt Peak and the crest of the Bald Mountain Range, and south of the
town of Loyalton. Major drainages within the project area include Cottonwood Creek, Lemon Canyon, Turner Canyon,
Smithneck Creek, Bear Valley Creek, and Badenaugh Canyon. The project area includes all lands within the fire boundary
on the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest; the area burned on the Carson Ranger District of the
Toiyabe National Forest will be analyzed separately.
In preparing the environmental impact statement, the Forest Service will identify and analyze a range of alternatives
that address the issues developed for this area. One of the alternatives will be no treatment. Other alternatives
will consider differing levels of implementation of salvage treatments, fuels reduction, watershed restoration,
road obliteration, wildlife habitat improvement, and new road construction and reconstruction. An ecological
approach will be used to achieve multiple-use management of the Cottonwood Fire area. It also means that the needs
of people and environmental values will be blended in such a way that this area's desired condition would represent
a diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystem.
Public participation will be important during the analysis, especially during the review of the draft environmental
impact statement. The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and
local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action.
This input will be used in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement. The scoping process includes:
1. Identifying potential issues.
2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.
3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis.
4. Exploring additional alternatives.
5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions).
6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.
The following list of issues has been identified through initial scoping:
(1) To what extent can the potential for future large, catastrophic wildlife be reduced within the project area?

(2) To what extent can the forest health be restored within the project area?


(3) What level of timber commodities could result from forest health restoration projects?


(4) To what extent will erodable and sensitive soils, and thus long-term soil productivity, be affected by the proposed
activities?


(5) To what extent will the view from Highways 49 and 89 be affected? What visual character will result from the proposed
activities, and to what extent can visual quality be improved in sensitive areas affected by the fire?


(6) To what extent will vegetative diversity be improved to support a wide variety of biological communities?


(7) To what extent and at what timing will wildlife habitat be restored for the large variety of wildlife using the area?


(8) To what extent will watershed conditions be improved and restored by the proposed activities?


(9) To what extent will air quality in the Sierra Valley and Truckee areas be affected by the proposed activities?

Comments from other Federal, State, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals who may be interested in,
or affected by the decision, are encouraged to identify other significant issues. Public participation will be solicited
through mailing letters to potentially interested or affected mining claim owners, private land owners, and special
use permittees on the Sierraville Ranger District; posting information in local towns; and mailing letters to local
timber industries, politicians, school boards, county supervisors, and environmental groups. Continued participation
will be emphasized through individual contacts. Public meetings used as a method of public involvement during preparation
and review of the draft environmental impact statement will be announced in newspapers of general circulation in
the geographic area of such meetings well in advance of scheduled dates.


The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by December, 1995. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice
of availability in the 

Federal Register

.


The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion
of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages Inc.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Cotton Yarn from Peru: Notice of Proposed Amendment to the Existing Conversion of the Scope of the Order from the Tariff
Schedules of the United States Annotated to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the international harmonized system of tariff classification.
On January 11, 1989, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the Conversion to Use of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of Classifications for Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings (54 FR 993; January 11,
1989) (1989 Conversion) for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress
as of January 1, 1989. The Department now proposes to amend the 1989 Conversion governing the countervailing duty
order on cotton yarn from Peru. Interested parties are invited to comment on this proposed amended conversion. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



In 1983, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on Cotton Yarn from Peru (C-333-002) (48 FR
4508; February 1, 1983). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules of the
United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1, 1989,
the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Section 1211 of the Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions are necessary to conform,
to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule [for]
all * * * orders * * *'' in effect at the time of the implementation of the HTS. 

Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the
1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of
January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced cotton yarn order
from TSUSA to HTS item numbers. The 1989 Conversion was based on a one-to-one correspondence of the TSUSA and HTS item
numbers. In the notice, the Department stated that the conversion could be amended, as warranted, at any time during
the applicable proceeding as a result of the submission of comments or new factual information. 

As a result of comments submitted to the Department by the importing public and advice received from the U.S. Customs
Service, the Department determined that the 1989 Conversion did not accurately reflect the scope of the countervailing
duty order on cotton yarn from Peru and, therefore, that the conversion should be amended. 

To rectify the problems in the 1989 Conversion, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and
the U.S. International Trade Commission, has once again compared the TSUSA-defined scope and the HTS-defined scope
provided by the 1989 Conversion, and identified those HTS numbers that more reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined
scope of the countervailing duty order on cotton yarn from Peru. A new proposed amended conversion is found in the attached
appendix.

In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order

Background 



In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on 

Certain Apparel from Peru

 (C-333-402) (50 FR 9871; March 12, 1985). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms
of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was
provided. On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).
Section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions
are necessary to conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule [for] all * * * orders * * *'' in effect at the time of the implementation
of the HTS. 

Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the
1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of
January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced apparel order from

Background 


In 1983, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on 

Cotton Sheeting and Sateen from Peru

 (C-333-001) (48 FR 4501; February 1, 1983). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms
of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was

Section 1211 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions
are necessary to conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized

of the HTS. 
Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the

Notice of first request for panel review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 26, 1994 Maquiladora Pieles Pitic, S.A. de CV and Pitic Leather filed a First Request for Panel Review
with the U.S. Section of the NAFTA Secretariat pursuant to Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Panel review was requested of the final countervailing duty determination made by the International Trade Administration
in the administrative review respecting Leather Wearing Apparel from Mexico. This determination was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 43815). The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned Case Number USA-94-1904-02
to this request.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Chapter 19 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic
judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from a NAFTA
country with review by independent binational panels When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established
to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms
with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.





Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of the United States,
the Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panels Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8686).


A first Request for Panel Review was filed with the U.S. Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article 1904
of the Agreement, on September 26, 1994, requesting panel review of the final countervailing duty administrative
review described above.




The Rules provide that:


(a) a Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance
with Rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Complaint
is October 26, 1994);

(b) a Party, investigating authority or interested person that does not file a Complaint but that intends to appear
in support of any reviewable portion of the final determination may participate in the panel review by filing a Notice
of Appearance in accordance with Rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline
for filing a Notice of Appearance is November 10, 1994); and


(c) the panel review shall be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including the jurisdiction of the investigating
authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and the procedural and substantive defenses
raised in the panel review.

Effective on October 1, 1994, you are directed to amend the September 8, 1994 directive to prohibit entry of textiles
and textile products, produced or manufactured in Laos and exported from Laos on and after November 15, 1994 for which
the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic has not issued an appropriate export visa. Goods exported
during the period November 15, 1994 through November 30, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign
affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).
 

Sincerely,

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Deepening of the existing channel from the ocean bar to the Port of Wilmington is the central feature of the proposed
action. Other features included in the proposed action consist of widening three turning basins and extending the
deep draft project about 1.5 miles further up the North East Cape Fear River. The total length of improvements is approximately
35 miles. Benefits which will accrue from deepening of Wilmington Harbor include reductions in lightloading of vessels
and vessel delays. Shippers will also be able to use larger, more efficient vessels.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Three alternative depths are being considered for the ocean bar channel (42, 44, and 46 feet plus overdepth) and generally
three alternative depths for the river channels (40, 42, and 44 feet plus overdepth). Four types of dredging equipment
may be used in this action. A hopper dredge may be used in the lowest end of the project and a bucket and barge dredge in
the middle reaches of the river (up to about mile 25). A rock dredge with disposal in barges may be used where rock is present
downstream of mile 25. The hopper, bucket and barge, and rock dredges will probably dispose of dredged material in
the approved ocean dredged material disposal site (ODMDS). A standard hydraulic pipeline or rock dredge may be used
from about mile 25 upstream. The dredged material upstream of mile 25 will be pumped to Eagle Island. In the project
where rock is to hard to dredge, the rock will require blasting. This rock will then be removed and placed in the ODMDS
or in Eagle Island.




If suitable rock material is available downstream of mile 25, instead of placement of the rocky material in the ODMDS,
an offshore fisheries enhancement structure may be created.

All private parties and Federal, State, and local agencies having an interest in the study are hereby notified of the
study and are invited to comment at this time. Also, scoping letter requesting input to the study was set to all known
interested parties on September 18, 1992.

Based on comments received to date, a scoping meeting will not be needed. All comments received as a result of this notice
of intent and the scoping letter will be considered in the preparation of the DEIS.

Significant issues to be analyzed in the DEIS include:

(1) Dredging of benthic resources,

(2) Blasting impacts on primary nursery areas, anadromous fish, the endangered shortnose sturgeon, sea turtles
and marine mammals, 

(3) Potential Increased salinity especially in upstream areas,

(4) Loss of wetlands due to widening of turning basins,

(5) Impacts to cultural resources.

The lead agency for this project is the U.S. Army Engineer District, Wilmington. Cooperating agency status has to
been assigned to, nor requested by, any other agency.

The DEIS is being prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy of 1969, as amended,
and will address the relationship of the proposed action to all other applicable Federal and State Laws and Executive
Orders.

The DEIS is currently scheduled to be available in January 1996.

[Recommendation 94-4] 
 


Deficiencies in Criticality Safety at Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant 
 


Dated: September 27, 1994. 
 


 
 

The Defense nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) has issued a number of recommendations concerning formality
of operations, including Recommendation 92-5, Discipline of Operations in a Changing Defense Nuclear Facilities
Complex. In that recommendation, the Board stated that facilities schedule for continued operations should develop
a style and level of conduct of operations which is comparable to that achieved at commercial nuclear facilities.
Recommendation 92-5 further noted that, prior to achieving an acceptable level of formality, major improvements
were required in a number of areas, including safety analysis reports, limiting conditions of operation, and training
and qualification of personnel. 
 
The Board and its staff have been monitoring the Department of Energy's (DOE) efforts to implement an acceptable level
of conduct of operations at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which is scheduled for continued operations.
The Board has forwarded a number of reports to DOE during the last two years indicating the existence of safety-related
concerns regarding operations at Y-12. DOE and its operating contractor, Martin-Marietta Energy Systems
(MMES), have taken some actions to correct deficiencies; however, a number of recent events have led the Board to the
conclusion that more aggressive and comprehensive management actions are required to bring the level of conduct
of operations at Y-12 to a satisfactory level. 
 
The Board notes that during the past four months a number of violations of Operational Safety Requirements and other
safety limits have occurred at the Y-12 Plant. Most recently, the Board's staff identified a substantial violation
of nuclear criticality safety limits within a special nuclear material storage vault at Y-12. When the staff
identified this deficiency to on-site personnel, including a senior MMES manager, an MMES nuclear criticality safety
specialist, and one of DOE's facility representatives, immediate corrective actions that were required by Y-12
procedures were not taken. In fact, proper corrective actions that were required by Y-12 procedures were not
taken. In fact, proper corrective actions were not taken until the Board's staff informed the DOE Y-12 Site Manager.
Subsequently MMES curtailed a number of operations at the Y-12 Plant. Reviews of compliance with nuclear criticality
safety limits at the Y-12 Plan revealed that a widespread level of noncompliance exists. 
 
In its Annual Report to Congress (February 1994) the Board noted that personnel and procedures are complementary
elements in implementing conduct of operations. The report stated, ``The health and safety of the public and workers
rest on a properly trained workforce accomplishing tasks in a formal deliberate fashion in accordance with reviewed
and approved procedures.'' In responding to the Board's Recommendation 93-6, Maintaining Access to Nuclear
Weapons Experience, DOE is evaluating the impact of expertise presently being lost through ongoing staff reductions
on their ability to perform nuclear weapons dismantlement at Y-12. 
 
The Board recognizes that DOE and MMES management have begun taking aggressive actions to correct the specific problems
of adherence to nuclear criticality safety limits, since the nuclear criticality safety occurrence referred to
above. However, the Board believes that more remains to be done. According, the Board recommends that: 
 


(1) DOE determine the immediate actions necessary to resolve the nuclear criticality safety deficiencies at the
Y-12 Plant, including actions deemed necessary before restarting curtailed operations and any compensatory
measures instituted. These actions should be documented, along with an explanation of how the deficiencies remained
undetected by MMES and DOE (line and oversight). 
 
(2) DOE perform the following for defense nuclear facilities at the Y-12 Plant: 
 
(a) An evaluation of compliance with Operational Safety Requirements and Criticality Safety Approvals (CSAs),
including a determination of the root case of any identified violations. In performing this assessment, DOE should
use the experience gained during similar review at the Los Alamos plutonium facility and during the recent ``maintenance
mode'' at the Pantex Plant. 
 
(b) A comprehensive review of the nuclear criticality safety program at the Y-12 Plant, including: the adequacy
of procedural controls, the utility of the nuclear criticality safety approvals, and a root case analysis of the extensive
level of non-compliance found in recent reviews. 
 
(c) A comparison of the current level of conduct of operations to the level expected by DOE in implementing the Board's
Recommendation 92-5. 
 
(d) Development of plans, including schedules, to address any deficiencies identified in the analyses conducted
above. 
 
(3) DOE evaluate the experience, training, and performance of key DOE and contractor personnel involved in safety-related
activities at defense nuclear facilities within the Y-12 Plan to determine if those personnel have the skills
and knowledge required to execute their nuclear safety responsibilities (in this regard, reference should be made
to the critical safety elements developed as part of DOE's response to the Board's Recommendation 93-1).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of interim policy statement 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy today publishes an interim Acquisition Letter for public comment that sets forth new interim
policies regarding the competition and extension of the Department's management and operating contracts. The policies
supersede Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation Subparts 917.605 and 970.0001, pending the issuance of a
rule. Supporting deviations have been authorized by the Procurement Executive. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy (Department), through its Contract Reform initiative, has concluded that the Department's
policies and practices regarding the extension of its management and operating contracts need to be revamped. Existing
policies favor indefinite extensions of incumbent contractors and, in practice, few competitions for management
and operating contracts historically have been undertaken. Such policies and practices effectively preclude the
introduction of new companies and best management practices into the Department's laboratory and weapons production
complex. 



This new policy establishes competition for performance-based management contracts (a new form of management and
operating contract) as the norm. Exceptions to competition will be made, on a case by case basis, only in exceptional
circumstances and only when authorized by the Head of the Agency. The underlying intent of the new policy is to balance
the benefits of a competitive environment with the recognition that long-term contractual relationships can facilitate
superior performance. Accordingly, the policy permits contract terms of up to five years with an option to extend
the term for an additional five years for competitively awarded performance-based management contracts. Contracts
awarded on a noncompetitive basis, however, will require justification and approval by the Head of the Agency prior
to any extension. 

In view of the foregoing, the Department has issued the Acquisition Letter set forth below as an interim policy, the
effective dates of which are set forth below. It is essential that these interim policies and procedures be effected
immediately so that the Department can initiate procurement 
actions for those contracts that will expire in the near term, but were not specifically addressed in the Secretary
of Energy's July 5, 1994 Action Memorandum. A notice of proposed rulemaking is in the process of being developed. 

The Department is seeking public comment on the Acquisition Letter in order to give the public, including those persons
who are affected by the policies, an opportunity to comment on the interim Letter before it is finalized.

Acquisition Letter 94-14

September 28, 1994 



Authority
 


This Acquisition Letter is issued by the Procurement Executive pursuant to a delegation from the Secretary and under
the authority of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation Subpart 901.301-70. 





 

I. Purpose 



The Department of Energy Contract Reform Team Report concluded that the Department's policies and practices regarding
the extension of its management and operating contracts needed to be revamped. The Contract Reform Team found that
existing policies favored indefinite extensions of incumbent contractors and that in practice, few competitions
for management and operating contracts were undertaken. 

Such policies and practices effectively precluded the introduction of new companies and best management practices
into the Department's laboratory and weapons production complex. The Report also recognized the need to balance
the benefits of a competitive environment with the recognition that long contract terms of up to 10 years can facilitate
superior performance. 

The purpose of this Acquisition Letter is to establish an interim policy that favors competition, yet preserves the
benefits of long-term contract relationships. Under this new policy, competition will be the norm. Exceptions to
competition will be made only in exceptional circumstances and only when authorized by the Head of the Agency. 



II. Background 



Subpart 17.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation prescribes policies and procedures for award, renewal, and extension
of management and operating contracts. 



III. Guidance 



This Acquisition Letter is issued to revise and consolidate the policy and procedures regarding competing or extending
performance-based management contracts, a new form of management and operating contract. The attached interim
procedures supersede all previous guidance regarding extend or compete decisions. They will be used until the rulemaking
process is completed. A class deviation from Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation 917.605 and 970.0001 has
been authorized to implement the attached procedures. In addition, a class deviation to subsection 17.605(b) of
the Federal Acquisition Regulation has been authorized to permit a revision to the timing of the Agency Head authorization
for the renewal and extension of performance-based management contracts at the five-year point in the performance
period under certain circumstances specified in this Acquisition Letter. 

By Action Memorandum dated July 5, 1994, the Secretary of Energy has made determinations regarding certain management
and operating contracts which will expire in the near term. The Secretary's determination mandates that certain
contracts be competed and that others be extended to facilitate either competition or the immediate negotiation
of key elements of contract reform into the existing contracts. Contracts awarded or extended pursuant to that determination
are subject to this Acquisition Letter; however, no further action is required relating to the extension of those
contracts until the time of the next extend or compete decision. Furthermore, contracts extended pursuant to the
Secretary's determination shall not include an option to extend the contract for an additional five years. 

The term ``performance-based management contract'' denotes the new form of management and operating contract that
will be used by the Department of Energy for the operation of its Government-owned, or controlled, laboratories and
weapons production facilities. Its use reflects the Department's policy and intent to convert traditional management
and operating contracts to the new form of contract called for in the Contract Reform Team Report.

IV. Effective Date 


This Acquisition Letter is effective upon the date of issue shown above. 


V. Expiration Date 


The Department is seeking public comment on these policies. The Acquisition Letter will remain in effect on an interim
basis until the Department takes further action after reviewing any public comments on these policies. 


Award, Renewal and Extension of Management and Operating Contracts 


I. Policy 


(a) It is the policy of the Department of Energy to use full and open competition in the award of performance-based management
contracts, except in exceptional circumstances where it is determined that the use of competitive procedures is
incompatible with the effective and efficient discharge of Departmental programs or is otherwise incompatible
with the paramount interest of the United States, and the Head of the Agency authorizes the use of noncompetitive procedures
to extend the term of an existing contract. Such authorizations shall be supported by a written justification which
shall be certified by the Head of the Contracting Activity and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). 
(b) Performance-based management contracts shall normally be competed at inception and upon expiration of their
contract term as set forth below. 


II. Contract Term and Options to Extend 


(a) Effective work performance under performance-based management contracts is facilitated by the use of relatively
long contract terms of up to 10 years. Accordingly, competitively awarded performance-based management contracts
shall provide for a basic contract term not to exceed 5 years and may include an option to extend the term for a period
not to exceed 5 years. 
(b) Contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this Acquisition Letter using competitive procedures may be
modified to incorporate an option to extend the term of the contract for a period not to exceed 5 years where: 
(1) the total period of performance, including the continuation, will not exceed 10 years; 
(2) the contractor's past performance under the contract has been determined to be of high quality; and 
(3) the contractor has also agreed to a contract modification necessary to implement other performance-based management
contract provisions. 
(c) 

Exercise of Options.

 As part of the review required by FAR 17.605(b), the contracting officer shall assess whether competing the contract
will produce a more advantageous offer than the option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract,
the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present, or can be negotiated into, the
contract, and the impact of a change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are considerations
that shall be addressed in the contracting officer's decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's
best interest. The contracting officer's decision shall be approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity and the
cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). In instances where a contract has been modified, pursuant to paragraph (b) above,
to incorporate an option to extend, a justification for other than full and open competition shall be prepared and
approved in accordance with FAR Part 6 and DOE Order 4200.1C prior to the exercise of the option. 


III. Procedures for Noncompetitive Extension 


Exceptional circumstances, as defined in I.(a) above, may exist that warrant the noncompetitive extension of a performance-based
management contract beyond the basic and option periods. In such cases, a performance-based management contract
may be extended for an additional period not to exceed 5 years when authorized by the Head of the Agency. Requests for
extension shall be subject to the following procedures:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941005-2-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-2-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) The Head of the Contracting Activity shall publicize the intent to recommend a contract extension in the 

Federal Register

 and invite comment thereon. 
(b) A recommendation to extend a performance-based management contract (other than through the exercise of an option
to extend) may be submitted to the Head of the Agency through the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance
Management at any time, but no later than 24 months prior to the expiration of the contract term. The recommendation
shall be supported by: 
(1) a justification for other than full and open competition prepared in accordance with FAR Part 6 and DOE Order 4200.1C,
including a certification by the Head of Contracting Activity and cognizant program Assistant Secretary(s) that
the use of full and open competition is incompatible with the effective and efficient discharge of Departmental programs
or otherwise incompatible with the paramount interest of the United States; 
(2) a detailed description of the incumbent's performance history in areas such as program accomplishment, safety,
health, environment, energy conservation, financial and business management and socio-economic programs, including
measurable results against established performance measures and criteria; 
(3) an identification of significant projects or other objectives planned for assignment under the contract if extended;

(4) an outline of principal issues and/or significant changes to be negotiated in the terms and conditions of the extended
contract; 
(5) in the case of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, a review of the use and continued need for FFRDC
designation in accordance with FAR 35.0l7-4; 
(6) a determination that the performance-based management contract remains the appropriate form of contract; and

(7) any other information pertinent to the decision. 
(c) 

Conditional Authorization.

 Authorization to extend by the Head of the Agency shall be considered conditional upon the successful negotiation
of the contract to be extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The Head of the Contracting
Activity shall advise the approving authority no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization
as to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the contracting activity's plans for competing
the requirement. 


(d) Justification.

 FAR 6.302 identifies statutory authorities for the use of other than full and open competition. These authorities
are permissive. Nothing in this Acquisition Letter is intended to impair the availability of these authorities for
performance-based management contracts. However, it is intended that they be applied only when the use of competitive
procedures is incompatible with the effective and efficient discharge of Departmental programs or is otherwise
incompatible with the paramount interest of the United States . 


IV. Renewal of the Performance-based Management Contract Form 


All performance-based management contracts shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether the performance-based
management contract form remains the most appropriate contract form. In the case of competitively awarded contracts,
the request to authorize the continued use of the performance-based management contract shall be submitted at least
6 months prior to the anticipated release date of the solicitation. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall submit
a request to authorize the continued use of the performance-based management form of contract to the Head of the Agency
through the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance
Management. 
For contracts that will be extended using noncompetitive procedures, the request to authorize the continued use
of the performance-based management contract shall be submitted as part of the extension recommendation required
by III.(b)(6).

<DOCTITLE>Pricing Policy For New and Existing Facilities Constructed By Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines; Date and Procedures
for Public Conference</DOCTITLE>



September 29, 1994.




Take notice that a public conference in this proceeding will be held on November 4, 1994, in the Commission Meeting
Room, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington D.C., 20426. The conference is to consider the methodologies to
be used in setting rates for transportation service with regard to new and existing facilities constructed by interstate
natural gas pipelines. The conference also is to examine whether revisions need to be made to the Commission's certificate
procedures related to new construction, such as its at-risk construction policies, to provide greater guidance
on rate design and construction approvals for individual projects. On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a notice
raising issues to be considered at the conference.
 The Commission also invited comments on these issues to be filed by September 26, 1994, and numerous comments have
been received.





Members of the Commission intend to participate in the public conference and will reserve time for questions and answers.
Any person who wishes to make a formal presentation to the Commission should submit a request to the Secretary of the
Commission no later than October 14, 1994. Each request should include the time anticipated for the presentation
and any special equipment requirements. Every effort will be made to accommodate requests to make presentations,
but, depending on the number of requests received, the Commission may have to limit participation. To provide a more
productive conference, the Commission encourages those with similar views to coordinate their efforts and choose
one spokesperson to make a statement on behalf of the group. After reviewing the presentation requests, a subsequent
notice of the conference presentation schedule will be issued.

The Commission will provide for remote viewing of the conference in Hearing Room 1, 810 First Street, NE, Washington,
D.C. In addition, if sufficient interest is shown, The Capitol Connection may broadcast the conference in the Washington,
D.C. metropolitan area or nationally. Those interested in the local or national television broadcast should call

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact; Proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed finding of no significant impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE) has prepared this Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on its proposal
to construct and operate the proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment. This proposed finding is based on the DOE Tokamak
Fusion Test Reactor Decontamination and Decommissioning Project and Tokamak Physics Experiment (TPX) Environmental
Assessment (EA), DOE/EA-0813, August 1994, which evaluates the environmental effects of using the existing
Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) systems and accessory facilities in the proposed construction and operation
of the TPX. The purpose of the TPX is to develop fusion energy to compensate for dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and
the eventual depletion of fissionable uranium used in present-day nuclear reactors. Proceeding with the TPX is contingent
on use of existing TFTR systems and appurtenant facilities. Decontamination and decommissioning of the TFTR is an
integral part of the scope of the proposed TPX; therefore both projects are evaluated in this EA.




Based on the analyses in the EA, the DOE believes that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. Therefore, the DOE is issuing a Proposed FONSI pursuant to the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and the DOE NEPA implementing regulations
(10 CFR Part 1021). DOE will consider comments received in making a final determination on whether to issue a FONSI
or to prepare an environmental impact statement.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Proposed Action 



The proposed action is to use the existing TFTR systems and accessory facilities in the construction and operation
of TPX, which would be primarily located inside the existing TFTR Test Cell. The TPX would require dismantlement and
removal of all TFTR activated systems within the TFTR Test Cell Complex. Dismantlement and removal of nonradioactive
and low activation components in areas such as the Test Cell Basement and the Hot Cell, would start immediately after
the conclusion of the TFTR deuterium-tritium experiment, which is expected to conclude in Fiscal Year 1995. Cool-down
of the Tokamak in the test cell will commence at that time. 

The TPX is being proposed as a national facility for fusion energy research to be built at the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory (PPPL). Its primary mission is to develop the scientific basis for an economical, more compact, and continuously
operating Tokamak in support of the design of an attractive demonstration fusion power plant. 

Waste from decontamination and decommissioning would include stainless steel and aluminum structures, piping,
copper coils, graphite tiles, solidified radioactive liquids, anti-contamination materials, and concrete rubble.
Waste would be packaged into Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers and transported to the DOE Hanford
site in Richland, Washington, as are current PPPL wastes. Approximately 950 m

3

 (33,500 ft

3

) of waste weighing approximately 2270 metric tonnes (2500 tons) would also be disposed. Construction of a radioactive
waste storage building for temporary storage of radioactive waste and final preparation of some radioactive waste
shipments would be required. This facility would be approximately 560 m

2

 (6000 ft

2

) in size, and would be constructed within the existing TFTR facility fence. A second storm water detention basin similar
to and west of the existing detention basin would also be constructed. 

Decontamination and decom
mis
sion
ing of the TFTR Test Cell could be completed in approximately 1.5 years, after a 2-year cool-down period. TPX construction
would minimally overlap decontamination and decommissioning of 
TFTR facilities. The TFTR Test Cell Complex would then be available for the TPX approximately 3.5 years after termination
of TFTR deuterium-tritium experiments. The total cost for the decontamination and decommissioning of the TFTR is
estimated to be $86 million. 

The construction and operation of the TPX would take place within the existing TFTR facility at Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory (PPPL), with construction scheduled to begin in early FY-1998. The TPX conceptual design is based
on the use of deuterium fuel, but does not preclude the potential upgrade and use of tritium fuel in the final year of
operation. Existing TFTR facilities would be adapted and used by the TPX, including TFTR Test Cell Complex; ventilation
exhaust vent and intake shafts; mockup building; tritium cleanup/waste handling area; field coil power conversion
building; neutral beam power conversion building; radioactive waste systems space; office and technical support
space; and miscellaneous PPPL support facilities. In addition to providing space for the TPX, the TFTR Test Cell Complex
would provide shielding (via concrete walls, roof, and floor), and provide for confinement and handling of tritium-contaminated
and/or radioactive components. 

The cost for construction of the TPX is estimated at $500M (FY-93), with the construction period 1997 to 2000.
New facilities to be constructed include TFTR Test Cell building modifications, a new Cryogenic Equipment building,
tank yards for water cooling and cryogenic tanks, and a new electrical substation. The Test Cell building modifications
would be internal and would not increase the existing external dimensions of the building. The Cryogenic Equipment
building would be constructed as a standard industrial single-story building, totaling about 1000 m

2

 (10,800 ft

2

) in area. The tank yard construction would include approximately 2,130 m

2

 (22,950 ft

2

) of new tank yard areas for new gaseous helium tanks, liquid nitrogen storage tanks, water storage tanks, and truck-trailer
access. This construction would take place on existing open space. The electrical substation construction would
involve installation of a new 138 kV transmission line between the existing substation and the new substation. The
new substation would be for transforming 138 kV power to 13.8 kV. A new electric power line would be constructed entirely
on PPPL property. 

Machine assembly would be scheduled for 1998, with the first operations during 2000. The TPX would be fueled with hydrogen
and deuterium plasmas for 10 years; radiation generation would not be significant in terms of neutron activation
of components or radiological doses. In deuterium operation, the peak fusion power would not exceed 140 kW. During
long pulse deuterium operation, neutrons with energies of 2.45 mega electron volts (MeV) would be the primary neutrons
produced, and annual production of these neutrons would be limited to 6.0  x  10

21

 neutrons. A smaller number of 14.1 MeV neutrons would be produced from deuterium-tritium fusion reactions with tritium
produced from the deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions. The number of 14.1 MeV neutrons produced during deuterium
operations would be approximately 2% of the number of 2.45 MeV neutrons produced. 

The TPX facility would be capable of operating with deuterium-tritium plasmas during the last year of TPX operation.
During deuterium-tritium operation, a fully-formed deuterium plasma would be developed (requiring up to roughly
1,000 seconds), into which tritium would be injected. Once tritium has been injected, the device would operate for
2 seconds with a peak fusion power of 15 MW, after which the plasma would be terminated. During the 2 seconds of deuterium-tritium
operation, both 2.45 MeV neutrons and 14.1 MeV neutrons would be produced, from deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium
fusion reactions, respectively. Production of 2.45 MeV neutrons during deuterium-tritium operation would be approximately
1% of the 14.1 MeV neutron production rate. Operation of the Tokamak would be controlled to limit annual neutron production
so that the site boundary dose restriction adopted by the project would not be exceeded. The deuterium-tritium phase
(if used) would be limited to the last year of TPX operation. Small amounts of tritium, and air activation products
would be released, and minor amounts of direct radiation would result from fusion neutrons and activated structural
components of TPX. 

Low-level solid radioactive wastes generated during TPX operations would consist of contaminated items (e.g.,
protective clothing) and solidified liquid wastes (tritiated water absorbed on desiccant and solidified liquid
waste from the decontamination area). The volume of waste would be similar to that generated by TFTR operations, which
was appropriated 7.4 m

3

 per year for deuterium-deuterium operations, and is projected to increase during deuterium-tritium operations
to 28.3 m

3

 per year (1000 ft

3

 per year). Wastes generated during TPX operations would be packaged to comply with applicable DOE and DOT requirements
and is expected to be shipped to the DOE Hanford Reservation in Washington for disposal, as are current PPPL wastes.




Alternatives 



Three alternatives were considered: (1) The proposed action, use of the TFTR facilities for the proposed construction
and operation of the TPX at PPPL, (2) proposed construction and operation of the TPX at the Oak Ridge Reservation in
Tennessee, and (3) no action. Location of the TPX at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant, near Knoxville, Tennessee,
would require construction of new support facilities including a new test cell, hot cell, waste handling and storage
areas, field coil power conversion building, and cryogenic facilities. The additional cost and time would jeopardize
the U.S. fusion program and make the TPX project infeasible. Under the no action alternative, decontamination and
decommission of TFTR facilities would occur under current management practices, but may involve a longer delay between
safe shutdown activities and commencement of decontamination and decommissioning activities. The longer delay
would not fit within the current schedule to meet the construction of the TPX. This delay may in turn be followed by a
2-3 year period of delay, during which the TFTR facility would be in a state of protective custody. The TPX would
not proceed under the no action alternative. 



Environmental Impacts 



The Environmental Assessment analyzed the impacts of the TFTR decontamination and decomissioning and TPX construction
and operation on the environment and on the health and safety of workers and the public. Both routine operations and
off-normal or accident scenarios were assessed. The Environmental Assessment considered impacts to air quality,
noise, water quality and quantity, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, threatened and endangered species, the visual
environment, land use, historical and archaeological resources, socioeconomic environment, radiological conditions,
and impacts of potential accidents. No significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed action are
anticipated. 

Activities associated with decontamination and decommissioning of the TFTR would not present any long-term or adverse
nonradiological impacts to the public or the environment. It would result in minor impacts, consisting primarily
of commitment of a small area of onsite land for the radioactive waste storage building and the second storm water detention
basin. Construction of the radioactive waste storage building and storm water detention basin may result in a temporary
small increase of effluent to Bee Brook, but would not exceed PPPL New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit or other State or federal regulatory requirements.

Potential radiological impacts of TFTR decontamination and decommissioning would not represent potential impacts
greater than those from current PPPL operations, which have had no significant consequences. Decontamination and
decommissioning activities would result in a dose of less than the adopted design objective of 10 mrem per year to any
member of the public from all project sources. It would result in minor releases of activated metal and tritium to the
atmosphere and sewer system. The maximum calculated individual public dose would be 2.3 mrem per year, and the increased
probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure from this dose would be 1.1 chances in 1,000,000.
This very low calculated effect means insignificant risk to the public. Occupational doses would not exceed the PPPL
administrative limit of 1 rem per year, which is less than the DOE limit of 5 rem per year.

Operational occurrences during decontamination and decommissioning that could result in the accidental release
of tritium, activated gases, or solids consist primarily of component failures and human error, and any releases
would be limited by inventories within the components. The largest calculated dose to the public from decontamination
and decommissioning accident scenarios, including beyond design basis accidents, is 390 mrem to a maximally exposed
member of the public. The increased probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure from
this dose would be 195 chances in 1,000,000.

The TPX would not present long-term or adverse nonradiological impacts to the public or the environment at the PPPL
site. Other TPX nonradiological impacts would be temporary, except for the commitment of a small parcel of land for
construction of new TPX facilities. Construction impacts due to test cell modifications and construction of the
cryogenic equipment building, tank yards, and electric substation would be minor. All construction would be built
on land already committed to DOE operations. This construction would all be within the current land use restrictions
governing PPPL site agreements with the DOE. For a construction project of this scope, the potential exists for 2.5
lost workday cases (work related injuries that require time-off from work) over the construction period. Also there
would be a 10% increase in the current amount of site traffic, which would increase the potential for on-site vehicular
accidents slightly.

Radiological impacts from the TPX would not exceed current impacts from PPPL operations, which has not been shown
to cause incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure. Potential environmental, safety, and health
radiological impacts were evaluated for both deuterium and possible future tritium operations. Atmospheric releases
of tritium and activation products constitute the potential sources of radiological exposure to members of the public.
Maximum projected atmospheric releases would result in annual effective dose equivalents of 1.2 mrem and 4.6 mrem
to a hypothetical maximally-exposed individual at the site boundary during deuterium and tritium operations, respectively,
with a maximum increased probability of incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure of 2.3 chances
in 1,000,000. These conservatively-calculated dose equivalents are less than the most restrictive limit for public
doses caused by airborne releases (the EPA limit of 10 mrem per year). Direct radiation from the TPX would be mitigated
with shielding to keep the total effective dose equivalent from all sources at the site boundary within the project
design objective of less than or equal to 10 mrem per year. This design objective effective dose equivalent is well
below the DOE limit of 100 mrem per year to members of the public from routine DOE operations.

Normal TPX deuterium-tritium operations would result in total estimated collective effective dose equivalents
of 7.5 person-rem per year and 24 person-rem per year to the projected population within the 80 km (50 mi) radius area
surrounding PPPL during deuterium and tritium operations, respectively. These doses amount to an average effective
dose equivalent of less than 0.002 mrem per year to each individual in the assessment area and would result in less than
1 health effect in the exposed population. On the basis of the collective effective dose equivalent, incremental
lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure attributable to TPX operations are not expected to occur. A collective
effective dose equivalent of 24 person-rem per year represents approximately .002% of the collective effective
dose equivalent from natural background radiation in the area (exclusive of radon). Occupational doses to workers
during TPX operations would result from direct radiation and small releases of tritium and activated gases. Operational
procedures, administrative controls and monitoring would ensure that occupational doses are kept below regulatory
limits and as low as reasonably achievable.

Accidental releases of radioactive material could hypothetically result from (a) Natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes),
(b) accidents with external origin (e.g., airplane crashes), (c) shipping accidents (i.e., accidents involving
the transportation of radioactive material), and (d) operational occurrences (e.g., tritium leaks). All TPX confinement
boundaries would be capable of maintaining integrity for design basis natural phenomenon, and therefore a release
due to a natural phenomena event is extremely unlikely.

Accidents with external origins and transportation accidents involving small quantities of radioactive material
would present little risk to the public and the environment. Transportation accidents involving larger quantities
of radioactive material, form example tritium, could occur; however, the accidental release of significant quantities
of radionuclides has a very low probability because of the demonstrated integrity of the approved containers that
would be used.

TPX operational occurrences that could result in the accidental release of tritium, activated gases, or solids consist
primarily of component failures and human error. Releases associated with these occurrences would be limited by
component inventories. The maximum calculated individual dose from accident scenarios is 390 mrem, which is well
below the DOE siting guideline limit of 25 rem. Incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with exposure resulting
from the collective doses would represent a negligible increase in the total number of such health effects in the exposed
population from all natural background radiation doses. The largest potential radiological impacts to the public
from TPX accidents, including beyond design basis accidents, are below regulatory limits.

After TPX operation has ended, a proper NEPA review would be conducted for the decontamination and decommissioning
of the facility. It is expected that the waste material resulting from decontamination and decommissioning activities
would qualify as low-level radioactive waste and would be disposed of at an appropriate DOE waste disposal facility.

TFTR operations would be discontinued prior to TFTR decontamination and decommissioning. Cumulative effects would
be minor and would represent a continuation of, rather than a change in, any impacts (negative and positive) associated
with TFTR operations. Commitment of 560 m2 (6,000 ft2) of land for the construction of the radioactive waste storage
building and 1,300 m2 (14,000 ft2) for construction of a second storm water detention basin would represent a long-term
commitment of land use. Environmental releases of small amounts of residual tritium during decontamination and
decommissioning would not add measurably to current low levels.

No adverse long-term environmental effects are expected from normal operations of the TPX. Tritium releases during
normal operations would not constitute a measurable contribution to background radiation levels, because of the
small amount of tritium to be released, its relatively short half-life (12.3 years), and rapid dispersion in the environment.
There are currently no measurable cumulative impacts occurring between PPPL and other facilities in the region,
and none would be expected for the proposed TPX. Releases of radionuclides to the atmosphere by commercial operations
(such as hospitals and research laboratories) near PPPL are not detectable in environmental samples collected around
PPPL; analyses show no radionuclide concentrations above background levels.

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders the Week of June 20 through June 24, 1994 </DOCTITLE>




<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>

During the Week of June 20 through June 24, 1994 the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to applications for refund or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.





Appeals 





Ivan J. Broussard, 6/21/94, LFA-0383




Ivan J. Broussard filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by the Privacy Act Officer of the Idaho Operations
Office (Idaho) of the Department of Energy (DOE) in response to a request Mr. Broussard had submitted under the Privacy
Act. In that determination, Idaho released to Mr. Broussard his entire Personnel File and portions of his Personnel
Security File. Idaho withheld under Section 552a(k)(2) of the Privacy Act portions of Broussard's Personnel Security
File which Idaho termed ``confidential source information.'' In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Idaho
had not adequately justified the application of Exemption (k)(2) to the information withheld from Mr. Broussard.
Therefore, the DOE remanded the matter to Idaho with instructions to explain why Exemption (k)(2) applies to the facts
of this case, and/or consider, and adequately justify if necessary the application of other exemptions to the facts
at issue.




KECI Corporation, 6/20/94, LFA-0382 




Keci Corporation filed an Appeal from a denial by the Richland Operations Office (DOE/RL) of its request for documents
concerning a whistleblower complaint that had been filed by a Kaiser Engineers Hanford contractor employee, Mr.
George Lengas. DOE rejected Appellant's claim that Exemption 6 could never protect the requested information from
disclosure, but remanded the Appeal to DOE/RL because the determination failed to describe the withheld documents
or to state with particularity the justification for withholding such documents. On remand DOE/RL will either release
the requested documents or issue a new determination which contains a descriptive index and specific justification
for withholding the requested documents. 




Williams & Trine, P.C., 6/24/94, LFA-0884 




Williams & Trine, P.C. filed an Appeal from a determination issued to the law firm on April 22, 1994, by the Manager/FOI
Authorizing Official of the Rocky Flats Office of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination, the Manager
stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Manager followed procedures which
were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information. Accordingly, the DOE denied the law firm's request.






Request for Exception 



Pledger Oil Co., Inc., 6/24/94, LEE-0080 




Pledger Oil Co., Inc. (Pledger) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
requirement that it file Form EIA-782B, the ``Reseller/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.''
In considering Pledger's request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a gross inequity or serious hardship.
On April 8, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.
No Notice of Objection to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within
the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Pledger's
Application for Exception. 



Refund Applications 



Donco Carriers, Inc., 6/20/94, RR272-130 




Bassman, Mitchell & Alfano, Chartered, filed a Motion for Reconsideration on behalf of Donco Carriers, Inc.
(Donco) and McMickle & Edwards in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. The Motion requested a modification
of the estimation technique used in the Supplemental Order issued on April 5, 1994, which partially rescinded the
original refund granted to Donco on November 30, 1993. Bassman argued that Donco based its gallonage claim on its dollar
purchases according to Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) reports which exclude taxes. Therefore, Bassman argues
that the price per gallon figures used to convert the dollar purchases to gallon should also exclude taxes. The DOE
found this argument to be convincing and used tax-excluded prices when revising the estimation technique used to
calculate the gallonage purchase. The applicant received an additional refund. 




Good Hope Refineries/Exxon Company, USA., 6/22/94, RF339-18 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed in the Good Hope Refineries special refund
proceeding on behalf of Exxon Company, USA, a purchaser of covered Good Hope petroleum products during the refund
period. In the Decision, the DOE determined that during the consent order period (August 19, 1973 to July 31, 1976)
Exxon's purchases from Good Hope were made on a spot basis. Exxon was, therefore, found ineligible for a refund based
on the allocation of total Good Hope overcharges (2.0854%) calculated by ERA and listed in the Good Hope audit file.
The refund period, however, extends beyond the time frame covered by the ERA audit, until July 31, 1979; and Exxon had
established 32,518,051 gallons of regular Good Hope purchases made after July 1976 and before August 1979. The firm
was, therefore, found eligible for a volumetric refund under the mid-level presumption of injury and its Application
for Refund was granted for $50,000 plus interest. 




Nashua Corporation, 6/21/94, RF272-25435, 
RD272-25435 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Nashua Corporation (Nashua), a manufacturer
of paper coatings, in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. A group of States and Territories (States) objected
to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to its customers.
In support of their objections, the States claimed that in 1979 the pulp and paper industry experienced record sales
and profits, and that in 1973 and 1974 the return on shareholders' equity increased. The States further asserted that
while energy costs increased during the 1970s, the pulp and paper industry was able to reduce its petroleum costs unit
through energy conservation and use of alternate energy sources. Specifically with respect to the applicants, the
States claimed that Nashua's sales and net earnings increased throughout the period of crude oil price controls.
In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the pulp and paper industry
was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. In response to the State's Objection, Nashua argued that the States
inappropriately relied on generalizations about the pulp and paper industry. Moreover, Nashua stated that it is
not a pulp and paper manufacturer, but is in the coated paper products business. The applicant submitted an affidavit
of the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Nashua, stating that the company's products were sold in
a highly competitive market, forcing Nashua to absorb increased product costs. The DOE determined that the evidence
offered by the States was insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user and that the applicant should receive
a refund. The DOE also denied the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the
States had not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. The refund granted
to the applicant in this Decision was $17,680.

<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>

During the week of July 4 through July 8, 1994, the proposed decision and order summarized below was issued by the Office
of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to an application for exception. 

Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.


The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter.

Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E-234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20585,

Petroleum Products, Inc. Charleston, WV, Lee-0087 Reporting 
Requirements



Petroleum Products, Inc. filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement
that it file Form EIA-782B, the ``Resellers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this
request, the DOE found that Petroleum Products was a certainty firm and therefore could only be granted relief if it
were experiencing extreme hardship. The DOE determined that it was not. Accordingly, on July 5, 1994, the DOE issued
a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.

<DOCTITLE> Issuance of Decisions and Orders the Week of July 25 through July 29, 1994</DOCTITLE>




<USBUREAU>Office of Hearings and Appeals</USBUREAU>


During the week of July 25 through July 29, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect
to appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.





Appeals


Betty M. Daley, 7/28/94, LFA-0396 








Mrs. Betty M. Daley filed an Appeal of the adequacy of a search for the medical records of her husband (a deceased former
Oak Ridge employee) under a Request for Information which she had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act.
The late Mr. Daley had been employed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory from March 1944 until his retirement in September
1985. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that the Oak Ridge Field Office had performed a search reasonably calculated
to recover responsive materials because records were found from the period June 1947 through September 1985, even
though no responsive materials were found from his initial employment in March 1944 through May 1947.

 


Beulah B. Carney, 7/29/94, LFA-0401 








Mrs. Beulah B. Carney appealed the adequacy of the search conducted by the DOE Oak Ridge Facility for her late husband's
personnel records. The Authorizing Official subsequently discovered documents proving that these personnel records
were destroyed as part of routine document destruction. The OHA ordered that the documents pertaining to the destruction
of the records be released to the requester and in all other respects denied the request.

 


Government Accountability Project, 
7/29/94, LFA-0398 








The Government Accountability Project (GAP) filed an Appeal from a partial denial by the Oak Ridge Operations Office
(Oak Ridge) of a Request for Information which it had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). GAP had
requested billing statements submitted by outside counsel to DOE contractors. In considering the Appeal, the DOE
found that while some of the information that had initially been withheld under FOIA Exemption 4 should have been released
to the public, some of the information requested by the Appellant was properly withheld under Exemption 4 since it
was both privileged and confidential. Accordingly, the Appeal was remanded to Oak Ridge for further processing.

 


Marilyn Cribb Stanley, 7/28/94, LFA-0399 








Marilyn Cribb Stanley filed an Appeal from a determination issued to her on June 20, 1994, by the Oak Ridge Operations
Office (Oak Ridge) which denied a request for information which she had submitted under the Freedom of Information
Act. The request sought records relating to the late Mary Avery Cribb, wife of a contractor employee at Oak Ridge Laboratory
during the 1940s. Oak Ridge stated that it did not possess any responsive documents, and the Appeal challenged the
adequacy of the search. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Oak Ridge followed procedures which were reasonably
calculated to uncover the material sought. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.

 


Robert Heitmann, 7/29/94, LFA-0397 








Robert Heitmann filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him on June 14, 1994, by the Albuquerque Operations
Office (AL) which denied a request for information which he had submitted under the Freedom of Information Act. The
request sought records relating to an alleged incident at the Travis School involving an airplane crash and atomic
weaponry. AL stated that it did not possess any responsive documents, and the Appeal challenged the adequacy of the
search. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that AL followed procedures which were reasonably calculated to
uncover the material sought. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.

 


Texas Instruments, Inc., , 7/28/94, LFA-0395 








Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the Oak Ridge Operations Office (Oak Ridge)
in response to TI's request under the Freedom of Information Act. In the Appeal, TI claimed that the search by Oak Ridge
was inadequate. TI cited in support of its argument an incident in which a TI employee allegedly saw a stack of responsive
documents that were not released. 



In denying the Appeal, the DOE found that the incident did not provide a basis for believing that responsive documents
had been withheld. The DOE also found that Oak Ridge had adequately searched for documents. 



Whistle Blower Proceeding


Francis M. O'Laughlin, 7/29/94, LWA-0005 








Francis M. O'Laughlin (O'Laughlin) filed a complaint under the DOE's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10
C.F.R. Part 708, contending that reprisals were taken against him after he raised concerns relating to health and
safety with Boeing Petroleum Services, Inc. (BPS), a DOE contractor. The alleged reprisals included wrongfully
denying O'Laughlin a management position to which he ostensibly was entitled, and later taking adverse personnel
action against O'Laughlin which included a demotion and corresponding salary reduction. Pursuant to O'Laughlin's
request under 10 CFR 708.9(a), a hearing in this matter was conducted by an Office of Hearings and Appeals Hearing Officer
on May 18 and 19, 1994, in New Orleans, Louisiana. In considering the transcript of testimony taken at the hearing and
the pleadings filed on behalf of O'Laughlin and BPS, the Hearing Officer determined that O'Laughlin had failed to
establish that he actually disclosed information to BPS which evidenced his good faith belief that there was a substantial
and specific danger to health or safety. 10 CFR 708.5(a)(1). Accordingly, in the DOE's Initial Agency Decision, O'Laughlin's
request for relief under Part 708 was denied. 



Request for Exception


R&R Oil, Inc., 7/27/94, LEE-0079 








R&R Oil, Inc. filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement
that it file Form EIA-782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering
this request, the DOE found that the firm was not suffering gross inequity or serious hardship. Accordingly, exception
relief was denied. 



Implementation of Special Refund Procedures


Telum, Inc., 7/25/94, LEF-0114 








The DOE issued a Decision and Order setting forth refund procedures to distribute $56,149.35 plus interest, received
as a result of a Consent Order between Telum, Inc. and the DOE. The Decision sets forth refund application procedures
for the customer who purchased middle distillates from Telum, Inc. during the period from December 1, 1973 through
April 30, 1974. Specific information regarding the data to be included in the refund application is discussed in the
Decision. 



Refund applications


Barrick Enterprises, Inc., 7/28/94, RF272-92432 








The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the Application for Refund of a claimant in the Subpart V crude oil overcharge
refund proceeding. The DOE determined that the applicant resold the refined petroleum products that formed the basis
of its application and thus passed on the costs of any crude oil overcharges to its customers. Therefore, the DOE concluded
that the claimant was not injured by any of the overcharges associated with the gallons that it purchased. Accordingly,
the Application for Refund was denied.

Burt County Cooperative Company, et al., 7/28/94, RF272-91445 et al. 








The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying seven Applications for Refund filed by the National Bank for Cooperatives
(CoBank) in the crude oil refund proceeding on behalf of seven local agricultural cooperatives no longer in operation.
CoBank claimed a right to apply on behalf of these cooperatives based on security agreements entered into with each
of them. These security agreements listed specific assets, accounts receivable, equipment and leaseholds as collateral
with CoBank. However, none of these security agreements listed oil overcharge refunds as one of the secured items.
The security agreements did list deferred patronage refunds from Farmland Industries, a regional cooperative,
as a secured item, but the Decision determined that deferred patronage refunds from a regional cooperative are not
oil overcharge refunds for which local cooperatives are eligible on behalf of their member/owners.

 


Texaco Inc./Donley's Texaco Service Station, 7/28/94, RF321-16838, RF321-21012, RF321-21013








The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted by Donley's Service Station (Donley's),
an indirect purchaser of Texaco motor gasoline. Donley's requested that the refund be paid to the firm, which is a partnership
currently owned by four partners. However, in accordance with prior Decisions, the DOE determined that the partners
during the refund period were eligible for the Donley's refund in proportion to their ownership interest, except
for those partners who had transferred their right to a refund. One of the Donley's partners both currently and during
the refund period owns 75% of the shares of the corporation that supplied gasoline to Donley's. The DOE decided not
to treat the two firms as a single firm for purposes of determining the applicable presumption of injury available
to Donley's. However, since the supplier had received a refund for its direct purchases of Texaco gasoline, the Donley's
refund for the common owner was reduced by 75% so that he would not receive two refunds for the same gallons. The total
of the refunds granted to the three Donley's partners who had joined in the outlet's refund claim was $7,285 ($5,192
principal plus $2,093 interest).

 



Texaco Inc./Lehigh Service & Supply, 7/29/94, RF321-19561, 
RF321-19562, RF321-19563, RF321-19564 








The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning four Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund
proceeding by four partners on behalf of Lehigh Service & Supply, a reseller located in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.
Two of these partners had previously received a refund for purchase made by Lehigh Gas & Oil, the firm that supplied
Lehigh Service & Supply with Texaco product. The DOE determined that these two partners were ineligible for a
refund for purchases made by Lehigh Service & Supply because they had already received a refund for these gallons,
and accordingly, these two Applications for Refund were denied. The other two applicants received refunds in proportion
to their ownership interest in Lehigh Service & Supply. The total amount of refunds granted in this Decision was
$2,366 ($1,686 principal plus $680 interest).

 


Texaco Inc./Ryder Energy Distribution, 7/29/94,RF321-14683







 
The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding
on behalf of Ryder Energy Distribution (Ryder). Ryder is the fuel purchasing and distribution subsidiary of Ryder
Systems, a nationwide truck leasing company. In its application, Ryder requested a refund based on the end-user presumption
of injury for its Texaco purchases which were consumed by its own fleet of trucks. It also claimed a refund under the
medium-range presumption of injury based on the purchases it made from Texaco which it later resold to its leasing
customers. The DOE determined that, in accordance with Gulf Oil Corp./Ryder Energy Distribution, 

21 DOE  85,345 (1991), Ryder must be considered a retailer, since as a vehicle rental firm, it was involved in
the retail sale of petroleum products. Furthermore, the DOE determined that it would be inconsistent with the adoption
of a $50,000 maximum refund under the medium-range presumption of injury for Ryder to receive in excess of that amount
without having to prove injury. Accordingly, Ryder was awarded $50,000, plus interest, under the medium-range presumption
of injury.

of $21,764.57, plus accrued interest, in refined petroleum overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial
Order issued to Aptos Shell, 

et al

. (Aptos) Case Nos. LEF-0092, 

et al.

 The OHA has determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart
V and 15 U.S.C.  4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act (PODRA).

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $21,764.57,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Aptos Shell, 

et al.

 (Aptos) on December 14, 1981. Under the Remedial Order, Aptos was found to have violated the Federal petroleum price
and allocation regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products during the relevant audit periods.



The OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of Aptos motor gasoline
will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who
satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of refined petroleum
products they purchased from Aptos during the relevant audit period. In the event that money remains after all first
stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C.
 4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA).

Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications
have been set forth in Section III of the Decision immediately following this notice. Refund applications should
be mailed to the address listed at the beginning of this notice.

Unless labelled as ``confidential'', all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours
of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings

Names of Firms: Aptos Shell, 

et al.



Date of Filing: July 20, 1993.

Case Numbers: LEF-0092, 

et al.

 

On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings.
Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons
injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons
or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures
for the disbursement of monies remitted by Aptos Shell (Aptos) and 4 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order (hereafter,
the Order) issued by OHA on December 14, 1981, and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. Each firm's
name, case number and amount of money remitted to remedy its pricing violations has been set out in the Appendix immediately
following this Decision.

Under the terms of the Order, a total of $21,764.57 has been remitted to DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred
during the relevant audit periods. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States
Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. 

See 

Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow
Account,'' August 30, 1993. This Decision sets forth OHA's plan to distribute those funds. The specific application
requirements appear in Section III of this Decision.



I. Jurisdiction and Authority



The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons
who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund
each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures
to distribute refunds, see 

Office of Enforcement,

 9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement,

 8 DOE  82,597 (1981).



II. Background



The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Each Remedial Order firm was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that
term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR Part 210 and 10 CFR Part 212,
Subpart F. The Order states that during the relevant audit period, they each charged prices higher than those permitted
by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation
of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make their records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b).

The firms were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of
gasoline had been sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations.

1

 After decontrol, DOE moved to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. 

See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash,

 20 FERC  62,319 at 63,537 (1982). Under the terms of DOE's motion, the firms were required to disgorge and remit
to the Treasury any violation amounts and the profits they had acquired as a result of their violations of the aforementioned
provisions of the pricing regulations. The firms objected to DOE's motion which has since been affirmed by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Decision issued on August 13, 1982. 

Id.

 FERC issued a final Order adopting its Proposed Order on September 29, 1982.





On April 28, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the funds that each firm remitted to DOE pursuant to the modified Order. We proposed implementing a two stage refund
proceeding and we stated that applicants who purchased gasoline from any one of the retailers identified in the Appendix
to the PDO would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event funds remained
after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the remaining funds would be disbursed in the second
stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15
U.S.C.  4501) (PODRA).

We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received
no comments since the PDO was published in the 

Federal Register

 more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally
outlined. Immediately set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications
during the first stage.



III. The First Stage Refund Procedures



Refund applications submitted in the Aptos special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner
as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we have frequently chosen
to adopt a number of rebuttable presumptions relating to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our
belief that adoption of certain presumptions (i) permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger
numbers by avoiding the need to incur inordinate expense; and (ii) facilitates our consideration of first stage refund
applications. 10 C.F.R. 205.282(e). For those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present proceeding.




(1) Calculating the Refund



We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout each firm's gasoline sales during
the relevant audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on
a volumetric basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined
product each applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric). Applicants believing they were disproportionately
overcharged by the pricing violations may present documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in
showing they were disproportionately overcharged will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric.

We have established a separate volumetric for each of the firms whose name appears in the Appendix accompanying this
Decision. The precise volumetric for each firm can be found in the Appendix. Each volumetric was obtained by dividing
the remedial order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline each firm is believed to have sold during
the audit period. 

2







(2) Eligibility for a Refund



In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) document the volume of motor
gasoline it purchased during the consent order period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by the overcharges.
The threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement
is typically satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund
is sought and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application.

The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially
those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb
the overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained
a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit them to pass through those
increased costs. 

See, Quintana Energy Corp., 

21 DOE  85,032 at 88,117 (1991).

<PARENT> FR941005-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We recognized that the cost to the applicant of gathering evidence of injury to support a relatively small refund claim
could exceed the expected refund and thereby cause some injured parties to forego an opportunity to obtain a refund.
In view of these difficulties, we proposed adopting a number of injury presumptions which simplify and streamline
the refund process. The simplified procedures reduce the burden that would have been placed on this office had we required
detailed injury showings for relatively small refund applications. 


(3) Presumptions of Injury 


Set forth below are the presumptions of injury that have been adopted for each class of applicant likely to submit refund
applications in this proceeding. These presumptions are not unlike injury presumptions adopted by OHA in many other
refined product proceedings. Each presumption turns on the category of applicant. 


Small-claim Presumption.

 We have adopted a small claim presumption of injury for resellers, retailers and refiners whose claim is $10,000 or
less, exclusive of interest. A small claim threshold of $10,000 has been adopted, even though we established a lower
threshold amount of $5,000 in many prior proceedings. 

See,

 e.g., 

Gulf Oil Corporation,

 16 DOE   85,381 (1987) (establishing a $5,000 threshold). The $10,000 threshold is more appropriate here because
the volumetric established for each one of the 15 retailers covered by this proceeding is higher than the volumetric
set in Gulf and in most other Subpart V refund proceedings. 

Id.

 If we were to adopt a lower threshold amount for this proceeding, then the number of very small firms that would be burdened
with the requirement to make a detailed injury showing would increase substantially. 
The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive
of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline
he or she purchased during the audit period from one or more of the retailers named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive
a full refund. 

See Enron Corporation,

 21 DOE  85,323 at 88,957 (1991). 


Mid-range Presumption.

 Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding
interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants,
these applicants will only be required to document the volume of gasoline they purchased during the audit period from
any one of the firms named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive a refund. 

See Shell,

 17 DOE at 88,406. 


End-user Presumption.

 We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry
and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973
(EPAA), 15 U.S.C.   751-760h, were injured by each of the firm's pricing violations. Unlike regulated
firms, end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required
to keep records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of
the alleged overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund
proceeding. 

See American Pacific International, Inc.,

 14 DOE  85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed to
have been injured. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of gasoline they
purchased during the relevant audit period from any of the 15 retailers whose name appears in the Appendix following
this Decision. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive their full allocable share. 

See Shell,

 17 DOE at 88,406. 


Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants.

 Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence
of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers.
They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases. 

Id. 
We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers
or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from the firms covered by these procedures. Such applicants may
nonetheless submit refund applications if they purchased motor gasoline from any of these firms during the relevant
audit periods. 
Any such applicants must demonstrate that they purchased products from one these firms during its audit period and
show they were injured as a result of their purchases to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding. Regulated
firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement to show injury. They must, however, show that they will pass
any refund received through to their customers. 


(4) How to Apply for a Refund 


To apply for a refund from one or more of the firms' settlement fund, an applicant should submit an Application for Refund
containing all of the following information:

 

(1) The Applicant's name; the current name and address of the business for which the refund is sought; the name and address
during the refund period of the business for which the refund is sought; the taxpayer identification number; a statement
specifying whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or other business
entity; the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for additional information; and the name and address
of the person who should receive any refund check.
 If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant
should specify those names.

<PARENT> FR941005-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an
applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available,
the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable
and must be explained. 
(3) A statement indicating whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has been authorized to file on its behalf,
any other application in this refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the other filing or
authorization should be submitted; 
(4) If the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with the Remedial Order firm, in this case any firm named in the Appendix,
the applicant should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated. If not, a statement
that the applicant was not affiliated with the Remedial Order firm. 
(5) The statement listed below, provided it has been signed by the applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing
the refund application: 




I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal
government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  1001. I understand that the
information contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire
application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room.

 

All applications should be either typed or printed and should clearly refer to the appropriate proceeding name (Aptos
Shell) and case number (LEF-0092) as well as specify the name of the firm it purchased gasoline from during the
audit period. Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes that
any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish this information to be publicly disclosed,
the applicant must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential'', containing the confidential
information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications
should be postmarked no later than June 1, 1995, and sent to: Aptos Shell LEF-0092, et al, Office of Hearings and
Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. 


(5) Minimal Amount Requirement 


Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund
proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution
in those instances. See Mobil Oil Corporation,

 13 DOE  85,339 (1985). Using the volumetric methodology, an applicant must have purchased at least 173 gallons
of motor gasoline from one or more of the firms named in the Appendix accompanying this Decision in order for its claim
to be considered in this proceeding. 


(6) Additional Information 


OHA reserves the authority to require additional information before granting any refund in these proceedings. Applications
lacking the required information may be dismissed or denied. 


(7) Refund Applications filed by Representatives 


OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications submitted
by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in this final Decision and Order. Strict compliance
with the filing requirement as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the
accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant, will be required. 


(8) Filing Deadline 


The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995.

IV. Second Stage Refund Procedures 



Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07. PODRA requires
that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund
monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four
energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to OHA, and any funds that OHA
determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in accordance
with the provisions of PODRA. 



It is therefore ordered 

That: Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by any one of the firms named in the
Appendix to this Decision, pursuant to the Remedial Order finalized on October 22, 1980, may now be filed.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the procedures for disbursement
of $83,847.58, plus accrued interest, in refined petroleum overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial
Order issued to Alameda Chevron, 

et al. 

(Alameda) Case Nos. LEF-0093, 

et al. 

The OHA has determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart
V and 15 U.S.C.  4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act (PODRA). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
In accordance with 10 CFR  205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out
below. The Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $83,847.58,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Alameda Chevron,


et al. 

(Alameda) on October 22, 1980. Under the Remedial Order, Alameda and the 15 gasoline retailers whose names appear
in the Appendix immediately following this Decision were found to have violated the Federal petroleum price and allocation
regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products between August 1, 1979 and January 27, 1980 (the Audit
periods). 



The OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of Alameda motor gasoline
or gasoline from one or more of the retailers named in the Appendix will have an opportunity to submit refund applications
in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the
pricing violations and who document the volume of gasoline they purchased from one of the retailers named in the Appendix
during the audit period. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining
funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C.  4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution
and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). 

Applications for Refund must be postmarked on or before June 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications
have been set forth in Section III of the Decision immediately following this notice. Refund applications should
be mailed to the address listed at the beginning of this notice. 

Unless labelled as ``confidential'', all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours
of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings
and Appeals, located in room 1E-234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585.

Decision and Order



Names of Firms: Alameda Chevron, 

et al. 
Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 
Case Numbers: LEF-0093, et al. 

On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings.
Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons
injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons
or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 C.F.R.  205.280. We have considered ERA's request to formulate refund
procedures for the disbursement of monies remitted by Alameda Chevron and 15 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order
(hereafter, the Order) issued by OHA on October 22, 1980, to those firms and have determined that such procedures are
appropriate. Each firm's name, case number and amount of money remitted to remedy its pricing violations has been
set out in the Appendix immediately following this Decision. 

Under the terms of the Order, a total of $83,847.58 has been remitted to DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred
during the relevant audit periods. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United States
Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. See Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director
OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow Account,'' August 30, 1993. This Decision
sets forth OHA's plan to distribute those funds. The specific application requirements appear in Section III of this
Decision.

I. Jurisdiction and Authority 



The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons
who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund
each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures
to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 

9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement, 

8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 



II. Background 



The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Each Remedial Order firm was a ``retailer'' of motor gasoline as that
term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and was therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR Part 210 and 10 CFR Part 212,
Subpart F. The Order states that during the relevant audit period, they each charged prices higher than those permitted
by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation
of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make their records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b).


The firms were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until a sufficient volume of
gasoline had been sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations.

1

 After decontrol, DOE moved to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. 

See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 

20 FERC   62,319 at 63,537 (1982). Under the terms of DOE's motion, the firms were required to disgorge
and remit to the Treasury any violation amounts and the profits they had acquired as a result of their violations of
the aforementioned provisions of the pricing regulations. The firms objected to DOE's motion which has since been
affirmed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Decision issued on August 13, 1982. 

Id

.





On February 3, 1994, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the funds that each firm remitted to DOE pursuant to the modified Order. We proposed implementing a two stage refund
proceeding and we stated that applicants who purchased gasoline from any one of the retailers identified in the Appendix
to the PDO would be provided an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event funds remained
after all first stage claims had been considered, we stated that the remaining funds would be disbursed in the second
stage in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15
U.S.C.  4501) (PODRA). 

We provided a 30 day period for the submission of comments concerning the proposed procedures. However, we have received
no comments since the PDO was published in the 

Federal Register

 more than 30 days ago. The proposed procedures will therefore be adopted in the same form in which they were originally
outlined. Immediately set forth below are the specific considerations that will guide our evaluation of refund applications
during the first stage. 



III. The First Stage Refund Procedures 



Refund applications submitted in the Alameda special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner
as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. In those proceedings, we have frequently chosen
to adopt a number of rebuttable presumptions relating to pricing violations and injury. Such a policy reflects our
belief that adoption of certain presumptions (i) permits applicants to participate in refund proceedings in larger
numbers by avoiding the need to incur inordinate expense; and (ii) facilitates our consideration of first stage refund
applications. 10 C.F.R.  205.282(e). For those reasons, we have adopted similar presumptions in the present
proceeding. 



(1) Calculating the Refund 



We have presumed that the pricing violations were dispersed equally throughout each firm's gasoline sales during
the relevant audit period. We therefore proposed that each applicant's potential refund should be calculated on
a volumetric basis. Under the volumetric approach, refunds are calculated by multiplying the gallons of refined
product each applicant purchased by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric). Applicants believing they were disproportionately
overcharged by the pricing violations may present documentation which supports that claim. Those who succeed in
showing they were disproportionately overcharged will be eligible to receive refunds calculated at a higher volumetric.


We have established a separate volumetric for each of the firms whose name appears in the Appendix accompanying this
Decision. The precise volumetric for each firm can be found in the Appendix. Each volumetric was obtained by dividing
the remedial order funds available for distribution by the volume of gasoline each firm is believed to have sold during
the audit period.

2







(2) Eligibility for a Refund 



In order to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding, each applicant must (1) Document the volume of motor
gasoline it purchased during the consent order period; and (2) demonstrate that it was injured by the overcharges.
The threshold requirement for any applicant is documenting the volume of product it purchased. This requirement
is typically satisfied when the applicant successfully demonstrates ownership of the business for which the refund
is sought and submits documentation which supports the volume claimed in its refund application. 

The injury showing, however, is a potentially more difficult requirement for applicants to satisfy, especially
those seeking smaller refund amounts. This is true because an applicant must demonstrate that it was forced to absorb
the overcharges. Our cases have often stated that an applicant accomplishes this by demonstrating that it maintained
a ``bank'' of unrecovered product costs and showing that market conditions would not permit them to pass through those
increased costs. 

See, Quintana Energy Corp

., 21 DOE  85,032 at 88,117 (1991).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941005-2-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We recognized that the cost to the applicant of gathering evidence of injury to support a relatively small refund claim
could exceed the expected refund and thereby cause some injured parties to forego an opportunity to obtain a refund.
In view of these difficulties, we proposed adopting a number of injury presumptions which simplify and streamline
the refund process. The simplified procedures reduce the burden that would have been placed on this office had we required
detailed injury showings for relatively small refund applications. 



(3) Presumptions of Injury 



Set forth below are the presumptions of injury that have been adopted for each class of applicant likely to submit refund
applications in this proceeding. These presumptions are not unlike injury presumptions adopted by OHA in many other
refined product proceedings. Each presumption turns on the category of applicant. 



Small-claim Presumption. 

We have adopted a small claim presumption of injury for resellers, retailers and refiners whose claim is $10,000 or
less, exclusive of interest. A small claim threshold of $10,000 has been adopted, even though we established a lower
threshold amount of $5,000 in many prior proceedings. 

See

, e.g., 

Gulf Oil Corporation

, 16 DOE  85,381 (1987) (establishing a $5,000 threshold). The $10,000 threshold is more appropriate here because
the volumetric established for each one of the 15 retailers covered by this proceeding is significantly higher than
the volumetric set in Gulf and in most other subpart V refund proceedings. 

Id. 

If we were to adopt a lower threshold amount for this proceeding, then the number of very small firms that would be burdened
with the requirement to make a detailed injury showing would increase substantially. 

The small claim presumption of injury for this proceeding, exempts applicants whose claims are $10,000 or less, exclusive
of interest, from the requirement to prove injury. Such an applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline
he or she purchased during the audit period from one or more of the retailers named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive
a full refund. 

See Enron Corporation

, 21 DOE  85,323 at 88,957 (1991). 



Mid-range Presumption. 

Mid-range applicants; that is, applicants seeking refunds in excess of $10,000 but less than $50,000, excluding
interest, are eligible to receive 40 percent of their allocable share without proving injury. Like small-claim applicants,
these applicants will only be required to document the volume of gasoline they purchased during the audit period from
any one of the firms named in the Appendix to be eligible to receive a refund. 

See Shell, 

17 DOE at 88,406. 



End-user Presumption. 

We have presumed that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry
and were not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price and Allocation Act of 1973
(EPAA), 15 U.S.C.   751-760h, were injured by each of the firm's pricing violations. Unlike regulated
firms, end-users were not subject to price controls during the audit period. Moreover, these firms were not required
to keep records that justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. An analysis of the impact of
the alleged overcharges on the final prices of non-petroleum goods and services is beyond the scope of a special refund
proceeding. 

See American Pacific International, Inc

., 14 DOE  85,158 at 88,294 (1986). End-users seeking refunds in this proceeding will therefore be presumed
to have been injured. In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of gasoline they
purchased during the relevant audit period from any of the 15 retailers whose name appears in the Appendix following
this Decision. Meritorious applicants are eligible to receive their full allocable share. 

See Shell

, 17 DOE at 88,406. 



Refunds in Excess of $50,000 and Other Applicants

. Applicants seeking refunds in excess of $50,000, excluding interest, will be required to submit detailed evidence
of injury. These applicants must show that the overcharges were absorbed, not passed through to their customers.
They will therefore be unable to rely upon injury presumptions utilized in many refined product refund cases. 

Id. 

We do not anticipate that other categories of applicants, such as, regulated firms, cooperatives, indirect purchasers
or spot purchasers, would have obtained products from the firms covered by these procedures. Such applicants may
nonetheless submit refund applications if they purchased motor gasoline from any of these firms during the relevant
audit periods. Any such applicants must demonstrate that they purchased products from one of these firms during its
audit period and show they were injured as a result of their purchases to be eligible to receive a refund in this proceeding.
Regulated firms and cooperatives are exempt from the requirement to show injury. They must, however, show that they
will pass any refund received through to their customers. 



(4) How to Apply for a Refund 



To apply for a refund from one or more of the firms' settlement fund, an applicant should submit an Application for Refund
containing all of the following information:




(1) The Applicant's name; the current name and address of the business for which the refund is sought; the name and address
during the refund period of the business for which the refund is sought; the taxpayer identification number; a statement
specifying whether the applicant is an individual, corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship or other business
entity; the name, title, and telephone number of a person to contact for additional information; and the name and address
of the person who should receive any refund check.

3

 If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant
should specify those names.

<DOCNO> FR941005-2-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941005-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an
applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available,
the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable
and must be explained. 
(3) A statement indicating whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has been authorized to file on its behalf,
any other application in this refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the other filing or
authorization should be submitted; 
(4) If the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with the Remedial Order firm, in this case any firm named in the Appendix,
the applicant should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated. If not, a statement
that the applicant was not affiliated with the Remedial Order firm. 
(5) The statement listed below, provided it has been signed by the applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing
the refund application:




I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal
Government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  1001. I understand that the
information contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire
application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room.



All applications should be either typed or printed and should clearly refer to the appropriate proceeding name (Alameda
Chevron) and case number (LEF-0093) as well as specify the name of the firm it purchased gasoline from during
the audit period. Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes
that any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish this information to be publicly disclosed,
the applicant must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential'', containing the confidential
information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications
should be postmarked no later than June 1, 1995, and sent to: Alameda Chevron LEF-0093, et al., Office of Hearings
and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. 


(5) Minimal Amount Requirement 


Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund
proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution
in those instances. 

See Mobil Oil Corporation, 

13 DOE  85,339 (1985). Using the volumetric methodology, an applicant must have purchased at least 173 gallons
of motor gasoline from one or more of the firms named in the Appendix accompanying this Decision in order for its claim
to be considered in this proceeding. 


(6) Additional Information 


OHA reserves the authority to require additional information before granting any refund in these proceedings. Applications
lacking the required information may be dismissed or denied. 


(7) Refund Applications filed by Representatives 



OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications submitted
by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in this final Decision and Order. Strict compliance
with the filing requirement as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the
accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant, will be required. 


(8) Filing Deadline 


The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995.

IV. Second Stage Refund Procedures 


Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided will be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C.   4501-07.
PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be
required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to OHA, and any
funds that OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed
in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. 


It is therefore ordered, 

That: 
Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by any one of the firms named in the Appendix
to this Decision, pursuant to the Remedial Order finalized on October 22, 1980, may now be filed.

Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response




Title:

 Exports from and Imports to the United States Under the OECD Decision (ICR No. 1647.01). This ICR requests approval
for a new collection.


Abstract:

 This ICR is required to ensure implementation of the Organization For Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD)
Council Decision C(92)39/FINAL on the Control of Transfrontier Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations
(OECD Decision), adopted by the Council at its 778th Session on 30 March 1992. This decision is legally binding upon
the U.S., a member of the OECD, and obligates U.S. exporters and importers of hazardous waste destined for recovery
within the OECD to new notification and tracking requirements, which are detailed in the ICR.
To implement the OECD Decision in the U.S., the EPA must modify certain regulations under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), and has developed a Final Rule to codify the requirements of the OECD Decision as it will be
implemented in the U.S. 
The OECD Decision does not significantly change the current hazardous waste export/import requirements under 40
CFR parts 262. For U.S. exporters, it will require the submittal of additional information as part of the Notification
of Intent to Export; also, some additional information required to be included in the tracking document exceeds that
presently required for the hazardous waste manifest. For U.S. importers, it requires the signing and transmitting
of additional copies of the tracking document and requires an expeditinG of this process (3 working days instead of
30 days). No additional recordkeeping burden is imposed by the OECD Decision. 
It is EPA's interpretation that the regulations under RCRA codifying the terms of the OECD Decision are applicable
only to hazardous waste destined for recovery that is: (1) Subject to the RCRA manifest requirements under the Federal
regulations when it is sent for recovery; and (2) sent to or received from a other OECD member country. Wastes not within
the scope of the OECD Decision will remain subject to the current RCRA export and import requirements in 40 CFR part
262, subparts E and F. 
EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance will use the information to determine compliance with applicable
OECD regulatory provisions, and to provide data on hazardous waste imports and exports for tracking purposes and
for reporting to the OECD.

<DOCTITLE>Office of Environmental Justice; Small Grants Program; Solicitation Notice for Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 Environmental
Justice Small Grants to Community-Based/Grassroots Organizations and Tribal Governments </DOCTITLE>





Purpose of the Grants Program 


The purpose of this grants program is to provide financial assistance and stimulate a public purpose by supporting
projects to any affected community group, which is eligible under applicable statutory authorities, (for example,
community-based/grassroots organization, church, school, education agency, college or university, or other
non-profit organization) and Tribal government who are working or plan to carry out projects to address environmental
justice issues. Funds can be used to develop a new activity or to substantially improve the quality of existing activities.



Funding 


For FY 1995, the Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) has budgeted $3,000,000 for the Environmental Justice (EJ)
Small Grants Program. EPA's 10 regions will each have $300,000 to award grants under this program. A maximum of $20,000
can be awarded for each grant. EPA will award grants in FY 1995 subject to the amount of funds appropriated by Congress.



Translations Available 


A Spanish translation of this announcement may be obtained by calling the Office of Environmental Justice at 1-800-962-6215.

Important Pre-Application Information 


Pre-applications must be postmarked no later than Saturday, February 4, 1995. Pre-applications will serve as the
sole basis for evaluation and recommendation for funding. EPA will award grants based on the merits of the pre-application.

Pre-applications must be mailed to your Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Office. A list of addresses
and phone numbers for the regional contacts is included at the end of this notice. 

Required pre-application forms, described below, may be obtained from the regional contacts. 

EPA expects awards to be made by May 31, 1995. 


Background 


In its 1992 report, 

Environmental Equity: Reducing Risk for All Communities, 

EPA found that minority and low-income communities experience higher than average exposure to toxic pollutants
than the general population. OEJ was established in 1992 to help these communities to identify and assess pollution
sources, to implement environmental awareness and training programs for affected residents, and to work with community
stakeholders to devise strategies for environmental improvements. 
In June of 1993, OEJ was delegated granting authority to solicit projects, select suitable projects from among those
proposed, supervise such projects, evaluate the results of projects, and disseminate information on the effectiveness
of the projects, and feasibility of the practices, methods, techniques, and processes in environmental justice
areas. 
Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 is the second year of the EJ Small Grants Program. Seventy-one (71) grants totaling $507,000
were awarded in FY 1994. 


A. How Does EPA Define Environmental Justice Under the Environmental Justice Small Grants Program? 


Environmental justice is the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and income with respect to the development,
implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no
racial, ethnic or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences
resulting from the operation of industrial, municipal, and commercial enterprises and from the execution of federal,
state and local, and tribal programs and policies. Environmental justice seeks to ensure that the communities, private
industry, local governments, states, tribes, federal government, grassroots organizations, and individuals
act responsibly and ensure environmental protection to all communities. 


Eligible Activities 


B. What Type of Projects Are Eligible to Receive Funding? 


To be selected for an award, the project must include one or more of the following four (4) objectives:

<TEXT>
 

1. Identify the necessary improvements in communication and coordination among existing community-based/grassroots
organizations, and local, state, tribal, and federal environmental programs, and all other stakeholders. Facilitate
communication, information exchange, and partnerships among the stakeholders to address environmental injustices
(for example, workshops, awareness conferences, establishment of community stakeholder committees, community
newsletters, etc.); 
2. Motivate the general public to be more conscious of their local environmental justice issues or problems and encourage
the community to take action to address these issues (for example, reforestation efforts, monitoring of socioeconomic
changes due to environmental abuse, stream monitoring, etc.); 
3. Develop and demonstrate an environmental justice practice, method, or technique which has wide application and
addresses an environmental justice issue which is of a high-priority. 
4. Teach about risk reduction and pollution prevention, and seek technical experts to demonstrate how to access,
analyze, and interpret public environmental data (for example, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Toxic Release
Inventories (TRI), and other databases.) 
Priority will be given to community-based/grassroots organizations, tribes, and organizations whose projects
will help improve the environmental quality of affected communities by (A) developing an environmental justice
project, activity, method, or technique which has wide application, (B) enhances the community's skills in addressing
environmental justice issues and problems, and (C) establishes or expands environmental and public health information
systems for local communities. 
Environmental Justice projects or activities should enhance critical thinking, problem solving, and the active
participation of affected communities in decision-making processes. Environmental justice efforts may include,
but are not necessarily limited to enhancing the gathering, observing, measuring, classifying, experimenting,
and other data gathering techniques that assist individuals in discussing, inferring, predicting, and interpreting
information about environmental justice issues and concerns. Environmental justice projects should engage and
motivate individuals to weigh various issues to make informed and responsible decisions as they work to address environmental
injustices.

The items discussed above are relative and can be defined differently among the applicants from various geographic
regions. Each pre-application should define these items and terms as they relate to the specific project. Include
a succinct explanation of how the project can serve as a model in other settings and how it addresses a high-priority
environmental justice issue. The degree to which a project addresses a high-priority environmental justice issue
will vary and must be defined by applicants according to their local environmental justice concerns. 


C. How Much Money May Be Requested, and Are Matching Funds Required? 


The ceiling for any one grant is $20,000 in Federal funds. Depending on the funds appropriated by Congress, EPA's 10
regional offices will each have approximately $300,000 to issue awards. 

Applicants are not required to cost share.

 


D. Who May Submit Pre-Applications and May an Applicant Submit More Than One? 


Any affected community group (for example, community-based/grassroots organization, church, school, education
agency, college or university, or other non-profit organizations) and Tribal government may submit a pre-application
upon publication of this solicitation. Applicants 

must be incorporated and non-profit

 to receive these Federal funds. 

Individuals are not eligible to receive grants.

 The qualifications of the project manager and other individuals participating in the proposed project will be an
important factor in the selection process. 
EPA will consider only one pre-application per applicant for a given project. Applicants may submit more than one
pre-application as long as the pre-applications are for separate and distinct projects or activities. 
Applicants who were previously awarded funds may submit an application for FY 1995. The FY 1995 pre-application may
or may not have any relationship to the project funded in FY 1994. Every pre-application for FY 1995 will be evaluated
based upon the merit of the proposed project in relation to the other FY 1995 pre-applications, regardless of whether
the proposal would expand a project funded in a previous year. 


E. Are There Any Restrictions on the Use of the Federal Funds? 


Yes. Among other things, 

EPA funds cannot be used

 as matching funds for other Federal grants, for construction, legal/attorney fees, or buying furniture. Refer to
40 CFR 30.410 ``How does EPA determine Allowable Costs?'' 



The Pre-Application



F. What is a Pre-Application? 


The pre-application contains four parts: 1) the ``Application for Federal Assistance'' form (Standard Form 424/SF
424), 2) the ``Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs'' form (Standard Form 424A/SF 424A), 3) a work plan
(described below), and 4) certifications/assurances forms. These documents contain all the information EPA needs
to evaluate the merits of your pre-application. Finalists may be asked to submit additional information to support
their projects. 


G. How Must the Pre-Application Be Submitted and Specifically What Must the Standard Forms (SF) 424 and (SF) 424A,
and the Work Plan Include? 



The applicant must submit the original pre-application signed by a person duly authorized by the governing board
of the applicant and one copy of the pre-application (double-sided encouraged). Pre-applications must be reproducible
(for example, stapled once in the upper left hand corner, on white paper, and with page numbers). 
As described above, a pre-application contains an SF 424, SF 424A, a work plan, and certifications/assurances. The
following describes the contents and requirements of the SF 424, SF 424A, the work plan, and the certifications/assurances
forms. 
The percentages next to the items discussed below are the weights EPA will use to evaluate the applicant's pre-application.
Please note that certain sections are given greater weight than others. The required forms described below can be
obtained by calling or writing to the EPA contacts listed at the end of this notice. 
1. Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424). An SF 424 is an official form required for all Federal grants which
requests basic information about the applicant and the proposed grant project. A completed SF 424 must be submitted
as part of your pre-application. (5%) 
2. Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs (SF 424A). An SF 424A is an official form which requests the applicant
to provide the basic information on how the Federal and non-Federal share (if any) of funds will be used. A completed

postmarked no later than Saturday, February 4, 1995.

 Pre-applications must be submitted to the EPA regional office for the region where the applicant is located. A list
of the addresses of the EPA Regional Offices (with the names of the regional contacts) and a list of the states which
these offices support are included at the end of this notice. 


Review and Selection Process


I. How Will Pre-Applications Be Reviewed? 


EPA 

Regional Offices will review, evaluate, and make selections.

 Pre-applications will be screened to ensure they meet all eligible activities described in Questions A, B, C, D, E,
F, G, and H. Applications will be disqualified if they do not meet EPA's basic criteria. 


J. How Will the Final Selections Be Made? 


After the individual projects are reviewed and ranked as described in Question I, EPA officials in the regions will
compare the best pre-applications and make final selections. Factors EPA will take into account include geographic
and socioeconomic balance, project diversity, cost, and projects whose benefits can be sustained after the grant
is completed. 
Regional Administrators will select the grants with concurrence from the Director of the Office of Environmental
Justice at EPA Headquarters. 


K. How Will Applicants Be Notified? 


After all pre-applications are received, EPA will mail acknowledgements to each applicant. Once pre-applications
have been recommended for funding, EPA will notify the finalists and request any additional information necessary
to complete the award process. The EPA Regional Environmental Justice Coordinators will notify those applicants
whose projects were not funded.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a one-day meeting of the Information Resources
Management (IRM) Strategic Planning Task Force. The IRM Task Force is a special task force formed under the Environmental
Information and Assessment (EIA) Committee, which is one of the standing committees of the National Advisory Council
for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator
of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and the EIA Committee examines issues associated with the gathering,
dissemination, and use of environmentally related data and information.



The IRM Task Force was formed to provide recommendations on key elements that EPA should include in an Information
Resources Management Strategic Plan for the Agency. The meeting is being held to discuss issues associated with implementing
the recommendations in the final report of the Task Force.


Scheduling constraints preclude oral comments from the public during the meeting. Written comments can be submitted
by mail, and will be transmitted to Task Force members for consideration.

<DOCTITLE>Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Emergency Management Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FEMA gives notice that the extension period for the Missouri regular crisis counseling program for disaster survivors
of the 1993 floods is extended from 90 to 180 days. The severity of the emotional trauma resulting from the floods in
Missouri warrants an extension of 180 days.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is charged with coordinating Federal disaster assistance under
the provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Act) when the President
has declared a major disaster. FEMA provided funding for a regular crisis counseling program to help those suffering
the trauma resulting from the 1993 floods in Missouri.



FEMA received a request from the State of Missouri to extend the otherwise applicable time limitations authorized
by section 416 of the Act, so that the State can provide additional mental health services that are critically needed
for citizens during the recovery operation. The extent of the damages wrought by the floods were of such magnitude
that the residents of Missouri suffered significant emotional trauma that warrants continuation of disaster mental
health counseling beyond the normal crisis counseling time periods.

The Director, Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), as the delegate to FEMA for the Secretary, Department of Health
and Human Services, helps FEMA implement crisis counseling training and assistance, FEMA believes there was a well-established
need for continuation of the regular crisis counseling program beyond a 90-day extension. Based upon the sound CMHS
recommendation, FEMA has approved a 180-day extension to the time period for the Missouri regular crisis counseling
program.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department

The system, entitled ``Delinquent Debtors File_Interior, OS-84,'' will include information pertaining

money to the Department, who have been identified as delinquent debtors. The information contained in this system
will be used for the purpose of collecting debts owed to the Department through administrative offset or salary offset
procedures. The notice is published in its entirety below.
As required by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)), the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Operations have been notified of this action.
5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11) requires that the public be provided a 30-day period in which to comment on the intended use of
the information in the system of records. The Office of Management and Budget, in its Circular A-130, requires

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact for an Incidental Take Permit for the Proposed Cedar Park Waterline in Travis County,
TX</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has prepared an Environmental Assessment for issuance of a Section 10(a)(1)(B)
permit for the incidental take of the Federally endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

) during the construction and operation of a water pipeline in Travis County, Texas. 



Proposed Action 



The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act to authorize
the incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler. 

The Applicant plans to construct a 20,193-foot long water supply pipeline from Lake Travis eastward to the Williamson
County line. The Applicant proposed to preserve documented perch trees for the warbler along the route, limit clearing
to 35 feet wide along the route and two 100-feet by 100-feet staging areas in non-habitat; schedule work during the
season when the warblers are absent from the area (August 1 through March 1); and the purchase and dedication of 33 acres
of occupied warbler habitat to a conservation organization approved by the Service. Details of the mitigation are
provided in the Cedar Park Waterline Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan. Guarantees for implementation
are provided in the Agreement. These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance
of an incidental take permit will be fully satisfied. 



Alternatives Considered 



1. No action, 

2. Proposed action, 

3. Alternate project route, 

4. Additional alternate project route, 

5. Wait for issuance of a Section 10(a)(1)(B) permit. 



Determination 



Based upon information contained in the Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan, the Service has determined
that this action is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human environment
within the meaning of Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly, the preparation
of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed action is not warranted. 

It is my decision to issue the Section 10(a)(1)(B) permit for the construction and operation of the Cedar Park Water
System Improvement Pipeline in northwest Travis County, Texas.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Record of Decision for the Patoka River National Wetlands Project.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has issued a Record of Decision (ROD)
establishing the Patoka River National Wetlands Project (Project) located in Pike and Gibson Counties, Indiana.
The decision was based on the entire administrative record for the 8-year planning process, including all issues
and concerns received in response to the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements. The ROD is available to
the public.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The ROD documents the decision of the Service to establish the Patoka River National Wetlands Project in Pike and Gibson
Counties, Indiana. The Service selected Alternative 4, described as the preferred alternative in the Final Environmental
Impact Statement, as the best alternative for implementing the Project. This action includes the acquisition from
willing sellers of 6,800 acres for the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge and acquisition of Wildlife Management
Areas from within an adjacent 15,283-acre selection area. The ROD identifies the alternatives considered, the issues
and concerns raised during the 8-year planning process, the rationale for choosing the selected alternative, and
the impacts of this selection.


The Project encompasses one of the last remaining stretches of bottomland forest in Indiana and the Midwest. It provides
some of the best wood duck production habitat in the State and is used by threatened and endangered species including
bald eagles, Indiana bats, and the proposed northern copperbelly watersnake. Project lands will be managed to protect
and enhance bottomland hardwood forests, other wetland habitats, and complementary uplands. The goal is to provide
essential food, cover and resting areas for migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, and resident fish
and wildlife; and to improve outdoor recreation and education opportunities for the American people. Copies of the
ROD have been sent to all landowners within the proposed Project boundaries; to Federal, state and local government
officials; interested parties; and all individuals, agencies and organizations who requested copies.

<DOCTITLE>Navajo Museum/Library/Culture Center Grant Application</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for grant funding; public comment period on Navajo Museum/Library/Culture Center funding request.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a grant application requesting funds to partially pay for construction of the Navajo
Museum/Library/Culture Center (museum) as proposed by the Navajo Museum and Library Foundation, Inc. (Museum Foundation),
acting through the Navajo Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Department (NAMLRD). The application requests $3 million
to partially fund construction of the museum in Window Rock, Arizona, as a public facilities project related to the
coal or minerals industry on Navajo Indian lands impacted by coal or minerals development.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






I. Background on Title IV of SMCRA





Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation
(AMLR) program to reclaim and restore lands and waters adversely affected by past mining. The program is funded by
a reclamation fee levied on coal production. Lands and waters eligible for reclamation under Title IV primarily are
those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or inadequately reclaimed prior to August 3, 1977, and for
which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State, Federal Tribal, or other laws.




Title IV provides for State or Tribal submittal to OSM of an AMLR plan. The Secretary of the Interior adopted regulations
in 30 CFR Parts 870 through 888 that implement Title IV of SMCRA. Ordinarily, a State or Tribe must have a surface mining
regulatory program approved pursuant to section 405 of SMCRA prior to submittal of an AMLR plan to OSM. However, on
July 11, 1987, the President signed a supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 100-71) that authorized the Crow
and Hopi Tribes and the Navajo Nation to administer AMLR programs without approval of Tribal surface mining regulatory
programs. Pursuant to those provisions, the Secretary reviewed the plans submitted by Tribes and solicited and considered
comments of State and Federal agencies and the public. After considering the comments received, if the Secretary
determined a Tribe had the ability and necessary legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV, the Secretary
approved the Tribal program and granted the Tribe exclusive authority to administer its plan.




Upon approval of a Tribe's AMLR plan by the Secretary, the Tribe may submit to OSM, on an annual basis, an application
requesting funds for specific projects that are necessary to implement the approved plan. Funding requests are reviewed
and approved by OSM in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 874, 875, and 886.




II. Background on the Navajo Nation Plan




The Secretary of the Interior approved the Navajo Nation's AMLR plan on May 16, 1988. General information on the Navajo
Nation's plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan, is
in the May 16, 1988, 

Federal Register

 (53 FR 17186). Approval of the Navajo Nation Plan is codified at 30 CFR 756.13.
By letters dated April 7 and 22, 1994, the Navajo Nation submitted a proposed amendment to its plan pursuant to SMCRA
(administrative record Nos. NA-207, NA-208, and NA-212). The Navajo Nation submitted the proposed
amendment with the intent of revising its plan to make it consistent with SMCRA and to improve operational efficiency.
OSM approved the plan amendments in the September 27, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49178).
Provisions of the plan, which includes the Navajo AMLR Code, that the Navajo nation amended and which are pertinent
to this proposed action include: Section 409, filling voids and sealing tunnels; and section 411, certification
of completion of coal reclamation, authorization to perform priorities one, two, and three noncoal reclamation,
and authorization to undertake community impact assistance and public facilities projects.
Provisions of the plan, which includes the Navajo AMLR Rules, that the Navajo Nation amended and which are pertinent
to this proposed action include: Part D, coal reclamation priorities and noncoal reclamation priorities prior to
certification; Part L, general reclamation requirements for coal and noncoal; Part M, certification of completion
of coal sites; Part N, eligible lands and water subsequent to certification; Part O, exclusion of noncoal reclamation
sites; and Part P, utilities and other facilities.

III. Background on the Navajo Nation's Certification of Coal Completion



By letter dated May 4, 1994, the President of the Navajo Nation notified the Secretary that the Navajo Nation intends
to reclaim all remaining eligible abandoned coal mines, including interim abandoned coal mines, as required by section
403(a) of SMCRA (administrative record No. NA-213). OSM is aware there are eligible abandoned coal mines on
Navajo Indian lands yet to be reclaimed by the Navajo Nation. However, the Nation has sufficient AMLR funds in reserve
to reclaim the remaining eligible abandoned coal mines. The Navajo Nation also submitted a grant application to OSM
that, upon approval of the proposed amendment, will enable it to reclaim those mines.

In addition, the Navajo Nation submitted a request for the Secretary's concurrence with its certification of completion
of all known coal-related problems pursuant to section 411(a) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.13. The Secretary's concurrence
with the certification was published in the September 27, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49178).



IV. Museum Funding Request



Section 411 of SMCRA provides that once a State or Tribe certifies that it will address all remaining abandoned coal
mine problems, and the Secretary concurs, then that State or Tribe may request funds to undertake abandoned noncoal
mine reclamation, community impact assistance, and public facilities projects under sections 411 (b), (e), and
(f), respectively. The Navajo Nation President and the Navajo Museum and Library Foundation, Inc., first expressed
interest in obtaining OSM funds for the museum under section 411(f) in late June and early July 1993. OSM informed the
Navajo Nation at that time and on a number of occasions since of the administrative requirements that the Nation must
fulfill before OSM can consider a funding request under section 411(f) of SMCRA. Those requirements included: Revising
the Navajo Nation's AMLR plan to include provisions authorizing NAMLRD to reclaim remaining eligible abandoned
interim coal mines and to undertake projects under sections 411 (e) and (f); certifying that all remaining abandoned
coal mine problems will be addressed; submitting an application for funds to reclaim all remaining eligible abandoned
coal mine problems; and submitting an application for funds for the museum.

Anticipating that those administrative requirements would be fulfilled, the Museum Foundation developed a grant
application that NAMLRD submitted to OSM on January 21, 1994, requesting $3 million from the Navajo Nation's share
of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to partially pay for construction of the museum. NAMLRD submitted the application
because it is the recipient of AMLR funds from OSM for abandoned mine reclamation, community impact assistance, and
public facilities projects pursuant to sections 411 (b), (e), and (f) of SMCRA. The Museum Foundation would be a subrecipient
if the grant request for $3 million is approved.

Under the provisions of section 411(f), the President of the Navajo Nation has determined there is a need for such a
public facility related to the coal and minerals industry. According to the application, the museum will display
Navajo crafts and culture materials in order to preserve the culture for future generations. It will include demonstration
areas in the museum where traditional Navajo arts and crafts will be made. A children's museum and library will also
be available. A visitor center will display art and photographs of historical and sacred places on or near the Navajo
Reservation and an exhibit showing the impact of coal and minerals mining in the growth and development of the Navajo
Nation. The total cost of the museum is estimated to be about $7.85 million.

OSM's formal review of the grant application requesting the museum funding will be conducted in the context of the
regulations at 30 CFR 875.15. Specific provisions applicable to the museum request include sections 875.15(e) (1)
through (7). Those regulations require the application to specifically set forth: (1) The need or urgency for the
activity or the construction of the public facility; (2) the expected impact the project will have on the coal or minerals
industry in the State or Indian Tribe; (3) the availability of funding from other sources and, if other funding is provided,
its percentage of the total costs involved; (4) documentation from other local, State, and Federal agencies with
oversight for such utilities or facilities regarding what funding resources they have available and why this specific
project is not being fully funded by their agency; (5) the impact on the State or Indian Tribe, the public, and the minerals
industry if the activity or facility is not funded; (6) the reason why this project should be selected before a priority
project relating to the protection of the public health and safety or the environment from the damages caused by past
mining activities, and (7) an analysis and review of the procedures used by the State or Indian Tribe to notify and involve
the public in this funding request and a copy of all comments received and their resolution by the State or Indian Tribe.

In accordance with 30 CFR 875.15(f), the OSM Director must prepare a 

Federal Register

 notice regarding the museum funding request and provide for public comments. Section 875.15(f) further requires
OSM to evaluate all comments received and to determine whether the funding meets the requirements of sections 875.15(e)
(1) through (7) and if it is in the best interests of NAMLRD's program. If OSM concludes that the museum request satisfies
all the requirements of section 875.15, OSM will approve the funding request at a cost commensurate with its benefits
toward achieving the purposes of SMCRA. 



V. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with 30 CFR 875.15(f), OSM is seeking public comments on the museum funding request. Written comments
should be specific and should pertain to the museum request in the context of the regulations at 30 CFR 875.15 and the
provisions of section 411 of SMCRA. Comments should include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations.
Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in OSM's final decision
or included in the administrative record.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Portable On-Car Disc Brake Lathes and Components Thereof; Notice of Commission Determinations to Review
and Remand to the Presiding Administrative Law Judge Certain Portions of an Initial Determination Terminating the
Investigation on the Basis of a Finding of No Violation of Section 337, and to Designate the Investigation More Complicated</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. International Trade Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review certain portions of
the initial determination (ID) issued on August 12, 1994, in the above-captioned investigation, and to remand the
investigation to the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) for further proceedings. The Commission has further
determined to designate this investigation ``more complicated'' and to direct that the ALJ's ID on remand be issued
by November 28, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 24, 1993, the Commission instituted an investigation of a complaint filed by Pro-Cut International,
Inc. (``Pro-Cut'') under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The complaint alleged that two respondents imported,
sold for importation, or sold in the United States after importation certain portable on-car disc brake lathes and
components thereof that infringed the sole claim of U.S. Letters Patent 4,226,146 (``the '146 patent''). The Commission's
notice of investigation named as respondents Hunter Engineering Company (``Hunter'') and Ludwig Hunger Maschinenfabrik
GmbH (``Hunger''), each of which was alleged to have committed one or more unfair acts in the importation or sale of
portable on-car disc brake lathes that infringe the asserted patent claim.


The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on May 2-4, 1994, and issued his final ID on August 12, 1994. He found
that: (1) Respondents' imported product does not infringe the asserted patent claim; (2) complainant satisfied
the economic requirements for existence of a domestic industry; but that (3) there is no domestic industry because
complainant is not practicing the '146 patent. Based upon his findings no infringement and no domestic industry,
the ALJ concluded that there was no violation of section 337. Respondents have not challenged the validity of the '146
patent in this investigation.
Complainant Pro-Cut filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on both infringement and the domestic industry's
failure to practice the patent. Respondents filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on the economic requirements
for a domestic industry. Complainant, respondents, and the Commission investigative attorneys filed responses
to the petitions for review. No agency comments were received.
On September 28, 1994, the Commission determined, by a vote of four to two, to review the subject ID and to remand it to
the ALJ for further explanation on two narrow issues. Specifically, the Commission was unable to discern from the
ID the ALJ's reasoning underlying his findings of no infringement and no domestic industry under the doctrine of equivalents.
Accordingly, the ALJ was instructed to address the following questions on remand:
1. Whether the accused device performs substantially the same function as disclosed in the ``means for attaching''
clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent?
2. Whether the accused device operates in substantially the same way as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause
in claim 1 of the '146 patent?
3. Whether the accused device achieves substantially the same result as disclosed in the ``means for attaching''
clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent?
4. To what scope of equivalents is the '146 patent entitled?
5. Whether, in light of questions 1-4 raised above, the domestic industry is practicing the '146 patent under
the doctrine of equivalents?
The ALJ was further instructed to make specific factual findings with respect to each remanded question, to indicate
what record evidence supports those findings, and to provide an analysis of his ultimate determination on each issue.
The Commission determined to adopt the ID in all other respects.
On September 28, 1994, the Commission also determined to declare this investigation ``more complicated'' in order
to provide the parties, the presiding ALJ, and the Commission with adequate time to address the remanded issues and
complete the investigation. The 18-month statutory deadline for completion of this investigation was therefore
extended to June 1, 1995. However, the Commission expects to complete the investigation prior to the statutory deadline.
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), and   210.53,
210.56, and 210.59 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53, 210.56, and 210.59).
Copies of the Commission's order, the non-confidential version of the ID, and all other non-confidential documents
filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours
(8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington,
DC 20436, telephone 202-205-3000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter
can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202-205-1810.



By order of the Commission.

Exempt Abandonments 

to abandon its 6.7-mile line of railroad extending between milepost Q-245.0, at Bedford, and milepost Q-251.7,
near Mitchell, in Lawrence County, IN. 


CSXT has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 


Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on November 4, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

2

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by
October 7, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental
and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. 


Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 







Decided: September 26, 1994.

Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement to Continue the Program of Protecting the Southwest Border Through
the Interdiction of Illegal Drugs With the Support of Joint Task Force Six

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice is to notify interested parties that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has prepared a
FPEIS for the proposed continuation of the Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6) support program. The JTF-6 program
involves providing operational, engineering, and general support to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that have
drug interdiction responsibilities within the southwestern border states. The Draft PEIS was filed with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 15, 1994, at 59 FR 18115; the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the Draft PEIS was published on May 19, 1994, in
the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 26322. Comments on the Draft PEIS were received from five Federal Agencies, five State Agencies, and four private
individuals/organizations. A request for an extension of time for review and comment was received from individuals
in Laredo, Texas, and the U.S. Department of Interior. The request was granted and the comment period was extended
from May 30, 1994, to June 10, 1994. Copies of all comments and responses are documented in the FPEIS. The FPEIS was filed
with the EPA on August 11, 1994, and published on August 19, 1994, in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 42831. One private individual/organization commented on the FPEIS. The Record of Decision (ROD) is currently
being prepared and will be available for public review after its completion.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Statutory Authority


This Notice is being issued to interested parties in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
Public Law 91-190, and Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, 40 CFR 1500-1508.



Background



JTF-6 was activated on November 13, 1989, at Fort Bliss, Texas, by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with
the President's National Drug Control Strategy. The thrust of this program is the use of Department of Defense training
resources in the support of agencies responsible for the fight against illegal drugs.

The mission of JTF-6 is to plan and coordinate military training along the U.S. Southwest Land Border in support
of counterdrug activities by Federal, State, and Local LEAs, as requested through Operation Alliance and approved
by the Secretary of Defense or a designated representative.

The JFT-6 program provides operational, engineering, and general support to LEAs operating within the Southwestern
United States which have drug interdiction authorities and allows the LEAs to conduct their missions more efficiently
and effectively. The actions performed by JTF-6 personnel are quite diverse, ranging from reconnaissance
operations to the building and renovation of roads and radio towers. The JTF-6's primary area of concern is within
a 50-mile-wide corridor along the U.S./Mexico border from Port Arthur, Texas, to San Diego, California.

The INS is responsible for the prevention of smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. This is
the task of the Border Patrol, which is also responsible for drug interdiction between the U.S. land Ports-of-Entry.

Since the Border Patrol has been the primary beneficiary of most JTF-6 engineering actions to date, INS elected
to act as lead agency for the preparation of this FPEIS. The EPA and JTF-6 elected to act as cooperating agencies.
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a PEIS was published on July 15, 1993, in the 

Federal Register 

at 58 FR 38140.



Purpose



The purpose of the FPEIS is to address cumulative environmental impacts of previous actions as well as those actions
which may be developed within the reasonably foreseeable future. The FPEIS analyzes these cumulative impacts and
generically examines the impacts of future individual actions based on experience with similar past actions. The
FPEIS also describes the different types of actions performed by JTF-6.

<DOCTITLE>TMBR/Sharp Drilling, Incorporated; Midland, TX and Operating at Various Other Locations; Amended Certification
Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm.
The certification notice was issued on August 24, 1994.
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
investigation findings show that some workers were laid off in New Mexico and in other locations in Texas.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect this matter.
The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,958 is hereby issued as follows:



All workers of TMBR/Sharp Drilling, Incorporated, Midland, Texas and operating at other locations in Texas except
Midland and in the state of New Mexico engaged in employment related to the exploration and drilling of crude oil and
natural gas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after May 6, 1994 are eligible to apply
for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.



Signed at Washington, D.C., this 26th day of September 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional
Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of September, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.

<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.



Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the Untied States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency or origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DRP-64, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee), for operation of the
Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New York.
The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 Power Plant Technical
Specifications. Specifically, TS 4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval
requirement for leak rate testing of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741,
AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870. A one-time schedular exemption from
plant specific requirements associated with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Type C testing (local leak rate test) for the
above listed RHR containment isolation valves will be processed separately. This one-time extension for leak rate
testing of the RHR valves would defer the leak rate testing until the next refueling outage, when the RHR system can
be removed from service as required by current procedures.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with
the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:
1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?


Response:

 The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change is limited to a one-time extension of the containment isolation valve
leak rate test for RHR valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870.
The change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation, make any physical changes, or alter any operational
setpoints. Therefore, the change does not degrade the performance of any safety system assumed to function in the
accident analysis. There is reasonable assurance that the extension will not result in a significant increase in
valve leakage considering that a review of containment isolation valve leakage rate test results through 1990 showed
that all leakage failures, except for one valve which was replaced in 1990, were random and nonrecurring. Additionally,
each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744,
and AC-MOV-1870 has redundant isolation barriers and is supplied by the IVSWS [isolation valve seal water
system] which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers. Further, due to the periodic surveillance
that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even
if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred, this would not significantly affect
off-site exposures.
2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?


Response:

 The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since
the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a
one-time extension to the leak rate test interval for RHR valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870.
3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?


Response:

 The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is reasonable assurance
that the extension will not result in a significant increase in valve leakage since a review of containment isolation
valve leakage rate test results through 1990 showed that all leakage failures, except for one valve which was replaced
in 1990, were random and nonrecurring. Additionally, each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC-732,
AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 has redundant isolation
barriers. Further, due to the periodic surveillance that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside
containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation
valves occurred, this would not significantly affect off-site exposures.

The NRC staff had reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facilities, the Commission may issue the license amendments before the expiration
of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendments involve no significant
hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the
Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By November 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendments to the subject
facility operating licenses and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the White Flint Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue,
White Plains, New York 10601. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary of the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first perhearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
The petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendments.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Michael J. Case: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

filed by a person other than an applicant must describe in detail:





(1) The interest of the requestor in the proceeding:





(2) How that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding, including the reasons why the requestor should
be permitted a hearing, with particular reference to the factors set out in  2.1205(g);





(3) The requestor's areas of concern about the licensing activity that is the subject matter of the proceeding; and




(4) The circumstances establishing that the request for a hearing is timely in accordance with  2.1205(c).







Each request for a hearing must also be served, by delivering it personally or by mail, to:

(1) The applicant, Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, to the attention of Mr. John H. Ellis, President, P.O. Box 610, Gore,
OK 74435; and





(2) The NRC staff, by delivery to the Executive Director for Operations, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike,
Rockville, MD 20852, or by mail addressed to the Executive Director for Operations, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 217 to Facility Operating License
No. DPR-59 issued to Power Authority of the State of New York, which revised the Technical Specifications (TSs)
for operation of the FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York.

The amendment modifies the Safety/relief Valve (SRV) performance limits. Specifically, the requested changes:
(1) Modify TS 2.2.1.B, and its associated Bases, to establish a single nominal SRV setpoint of 1110 psig; (2) modify
TS 4.6.E, and its associated Bases, to increase the SRV setpoint tolerance to 3%; and (3) modify TSs 3.5.D, 3.6.E and
4.5.D, and their associated Bases, to allow for two SRVs (or automatic depressurization system (ADS) valves) to be
inoperable during continuous power operation.



In addition, the amendment clarifies terminology, corrects typographical errors, removes a surveillance requirement
which should have been deleted as part of Amendment No. 130, and deletes a duplicate TS. Specifically, the requested
changes; (1) Modify TS 1.2.1, and the Bases sections for TS 3.6.E and 4.6.E, to clarify terminology; (2) modify TS 3.5.D.2,
and the Bases sections for TSs 1.2 and 2.2, to correct typographical errors; (3) modify TS 4.2.B, Table 4.2-2,
to correct an error made in Amendment No. 130 that failed to delete the requirement to perform logic functional testing
on the ADS bellows pressure switch; (4) modify TS 4.5.D.1.b, to move the TS to 4.6.E.4, a new section, and clarify the
requirements associated with SRV manual actuation testing; (5) modify Bases sections for TSs 3.6.E and 4.6.E, to
move the Bases for the SRV manual actuation testing to the applicable sections; and (6) modify TS 4.6.E.4, to delete
a duplicate specification pertaining to the annual report of SRV failures.

The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1990 (55 FR 20228) and on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27064). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene
was filed following this notice.



The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) related to the action and has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement. Based upon the EA, the Commission has concluded that the issuance of this amendment
will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to the action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated December 20, 1989, as
supplemented by letters dated January 16, 1990, January 3, 1992, January 30, 1992, May 5, 1993, and May 26, 1993 and
superseded March 2, 1994, (2) Amendment No. 217 to License No. DPR-59, and (3) the Commission's related Safety
Evaluation and EA. These letters are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120
L Street, NW., Washington, DC at the Reference and Documents Department, Penfield Library, State University of New
York, Oswego, New York.

<DOCTITLE>Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards; Procedures for Meetings </DOCTITLE>



Background



Procedures to be followed with respect to meetings conducted pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) are described in this
notice. These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting
notices. 

The ACRS is a statutory group established by Congress to review and report on applications for the licensing of nuclear
power reactor facilities and on certain other nuclear safety matters. The Committee's reports become a part of the
public record. The ACRS meetings are normally open to the public and provide opportunities for oral or written statements
from members of the public to be considered as part of the Committee's information gathering procedures. The meetings
are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part
of the Commission's licensing process. ACRS full Committee meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal
Advisory Committee Act. 



General Rules Regarding ACRS Meetings 



An agenda is published in the 

Federal Register

 for each full Committee meeting. Practical considerations may dictate some changes to the agenda. The Chairman of
the Committee is empowered to conduct the meeting in a manner that, in his judgment, will facilitate the orderly conduct
of business, including making provisions of continue discussions of matters not completed on the scheduled day to
the next day. 

The following requirements shall apply to public participation in ACRS meetings: 

(a) Persons wishing to submit written statements regarding the agenda items may do so by providing a readily reproducible
copy at the beginning of the meeting. Comments should be limited to matters under consideration by the Committee.


Persons desiring to mail written comments may do so by sending a readily reproducible copy addressed to the Designated
Federal Official specified in the 

Federal Register

 notice for the individual meeting in care of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555. Comments should be in the possession of the Designated Federal Official no later than five days
prior to a meeting to allow time for reproduction, distribution and consideration at the meeting. 

(b) Persons desiring to make oral statements at the meeting should make a request to do so to the Designated Federal
Official prior to the beginning of the meeting and summarize the content of the oral statements for the Designated
Federal Official. If possible, the request should be made five days before the meeting, identifying the topics to
be discussed and the amount of time needed for presentation, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. The committee
will hear oral statements on topics being reviewed at an appropriate time during the meeting scheduled by the Chairman.


(c) Further information regarding topics to be discussed, whether a meeting has been cancelled or rescheduled, and
the Chairman's ruling on requests for the opportunity to present oral statements and the time allotted therefore
can be obtained by contacting, on the working day prior to the meeting, the Office of the Executive Director of the ACRS
(telephone: 301/415-7360, ATTN: the Designated Federal Official specified in the 

Federal Register

 notice for the meeting) between 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Eastern time. 

(d) During the ACRS meeting presentations and discussions, questions may be asked by ACRS members, Committee consultants,
and the NRC and ACRS staff. 

(e) The use of still, motion picture, and television cameras will be permitted both before and after the meeting and
during any recess, subject to the condition that the physical installation and presence of such equipment will not
interfere with the conduct of the meeting. Approval from the Designated Federal Official will have to be obtained
prior to the installation or use of such equipment. The use of such equipment will be allowed while the meeting is in
session at the discretion of the Chairman to a degree that it is not disruptive. When use of such equipment is permitted,
appropriate measures will be taken to protect proprietary or privileged information that may be in documents, folders,
etc., being used during the meeting. Electronic recording will be permitted only during those portions of the meeting
that are open to the public. 

(f) A transcript is kept for certain open portions of the meeting and will be available in the NRC Public Document Room,
2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20555, for use within one week following the meeting. A copy of the certified minutes
of the meeting will be available at the same location on or before three months following the meeting. Copies may be
obtained at the Public Document Room upon payment of appropriate charges. 


(g) When ACRS meetings are held at locations other than at NRC facilities, reproduction facilities may not be available
at reasonable cost. Accordingly, 25 additional copies of the materials to be used during the meeting should be provided
for distribution at such meetings. 



Special Provisions When Proprietary Sessions are to be Held



If it is necessary to hold closed sessions for the purpose of discussing matters involving proprietary information,
persons with agreements permitting access to such information may attend those portions of the ACRS meetings where
this material is being discussed upon confirmation that such agreements are effective and related to the material
being discussed. 

The Designated Federal Official should be informed of such an agreement at least five working days prior to the meeting
so that it can be confirmed, and a determination can be made regarding the applicability of the agreement to the material
that will be discussed during the meeting. The minimum information provided should include information regarding
the date of the agreement, the scope of material included in the agreement, the project or projects involved, and the
names and titles of the persons signing the agreement. Additional information may be requested to identify the specific
agreement involved. A copy of the executed agreement should be provided to the Designated Federal Official prior
to the beginning of the meeting for admittance to the closed session.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>







Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Amendments to Rules 575 (``Giving of Proxies Restricted''), 576 (``Transmission of Proxy Material to Customers''),
577 (``Giving Proxies by Member Organization'') and 585 (``Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material'')


September 28, 1994.



I. Introduction



On February 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend various Exchange rules governing proxies. On May 26, 1994, the Amex submitted to the
Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.








Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 8, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change as amended.







II. Description of the Proposal



The Exchange is amending several Amex Rules related to the giving of proxies and the transmission of proxy and other
related materials. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Amex Rules: 575 (``Giving of Proxies Restricted''),
576 (``Transmission of Proxy Material to Customers''), 577 (``Giving Proxies by Member Organization''), and 585
(``Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material'').

The amendments to Amex Rules 575, 576, 577 and 585 will permit registered investment advisers who exercise investment
discretion pursuant to an advisory contract, and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of the
securities, to receive proxy materials, annual reports and other related material, and to vote proxies in lieu of
the beneficial owners. The term investment adviser is defined to include a registered broker-dealer (

e.g., 

a member organization).






Currently, Exchange rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities
held in its custody, unless the securities are beneficially owned by a member organization, or the beneficial owner
has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is non-substantive.
Currently, Exchange rules also require member organizations to transmit proxy and related issuer materials, as
well as requests for voting instructions, to each beneficial owner of stock held in the member organization's possession
or control. Rule 576.60 explicitly requires that proxy material be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner
has instructed the member organization not to do so.

According to the Exchange, a number of member organizations along with the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities
Industry Association (``SIA'') informed the Exchange that many of their customers do not want to receive proxy materials,
or vote the proxy. These member organizations have indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals
represent their interests in receiving and voting proxies because they are better qualified.
In addition, the Exchange is amending Rule 575 to conform that Rule to a comparable New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')
Rule which allows a member organization, that is designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock
held as assets of an ERISA Plan, to vote the proxies on the stock in accordance with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities.





The Amex believes that it is appropriate to modify these Amex rules to conform to NYSE rules because most Amex member
firms doing a public business are dual members of both the NYSE and Amex, and the rules of the two exchanges regarding
proxies and voting have historically been substantially the same.
Amex Rule 575 (``Giving of Proxies Restricted'') currently provides that no member organization shall give or authorize
the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name, or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted
under the provisions of Rule 577, unless the member organization is the beneficial owner of the stock.
The Exchange proposes to add two exceptions (paragraphs (1) and (2)) to Rule 575. Paragraph (1) would provide that
any member organization designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA
Plan that expressly grants discretion to the investment manager to manage, acquire, or dispose of any plan asset and
which has not expressly reserved the proxy voting right for the named fiduciary may vote the proxies in accordance
with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. Paragraph (2) would provide that any person registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract
for the beneficial owner and who has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner (``designated investment
adviser'') to vote the proxies for stock which is in the possession or control of the member organization, may vote
such proxy.
Amex Rule 576 (``Transmission of Proxy Material to Customers'') generally provides that, whenever a person soliciting
proxies furnishes a member organization copies of all soliciting material for registered holders, and provides
assurance that he will reimburse such member organization for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with such solicitation, such member shall transmit to each beneficial owner of stock which is in its possession or
control, the material furnished. The Exchange is amending Rule 576, paragraph (a) to add the requirement that the
member organization may also transmit the soliciting material to a designated investment adviser to receive soliciting
material in lieu of the beneficial owner.
The Exchange also is amending Rules 576(b) (1) and (2), which deal with what soliciting material the member organization
receiving proxy information shall transmit and when such transmission shall occur. As amended, Rule 576(b)(1) provides
that the member organization shall transmit, with soliciting material, a request for voting instruction and a statement
to the effect that, if such instructions are not received by the tenth day before the meeting, the proxy may be given
at discretion by the owner of record of the stock, provided that such statement may be made only when the proxy soliciting
material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
at least fifteen days before the meeting. As amended, Rule 576(b)(1) also provides that when the proxy soliciting
material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
twenty-five days or more before the meeting, the statement accompanying such material shall be to the effect that
the proxy may be given fifteen days before the meeting at the discretion of the owner of record of the stock.

<TEXT>
 

Rule 576(b)(2), as amended, provides that, instead of the material submitted under Rule 576(b)(1), the member organization
may transmit with the soliciting material a signed proxy indicating the number of shares held for the beneficial owner
and bearing a symbol identifying the proxy records of such member organization, and a letter informing the beneficial
owner or the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser of the necessity for completing the proxy form and
forwarding it to the person soliciting proxies in order that the shares may be represented at the meeting.

The Exchange also is modifying Commentaries .10 and .60 to Rule 576. Commentary .10 (``Annual reports to be transmitted'')
is being amended to provide that annual reports shall be transmitted to beneficial owners or to beneficial owners'
designated investment advisers under the same conditions as those applying to proxy soliciting material under Rule
567 even through it is not proxy soliciting material under the proxy rules of the Commission. Commentary .60 (``Duty
to transmit even when requested not to'') currently provides that proxy material must be sent to a beneficial owner
even through such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so. The Exchange is qualifying this provision
to permit the beneficial owner to instruct the member organization in writing to send such material to the beneficial
owner's designated investment adviser.

The Exchange also is adding provisions for a beneficial owner's designated investment adviser to Rule 577 (``Giving
of Proxies by member Organization, Voting Procedure Without Instructions''). As amended, the Rule provides that
a member organization which has transmitted proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial
owner's designated investment adviser to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner and solicited
voting instructions in accordance with the provisions of Rule 576, and who has not received instructions from the
beneficial owner or from the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement
accompanying such material, may give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote such stock, provided certain enumerated
conditions are met.

The Exchange is making two changes to Rule 577, Commentary .10 (``Giving a Proxy to Vote Stock''). As amended, paragraphs
(1) and (2) state that a member organization may give a proxy to vote stock provided that: (1) it has transmitted proxy
soliciting material to the beneficial owner of stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser
in accordance with Rule 576, and (2) it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner or from the beneficial
owner's designated investment adviser by the date specified in the statement accompanying such material. The remaining
condition in paragraph (3) is unchanged.

Rule 585_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material_currently provides that a member organization, upon
request by a company, and when furnished with copies of interim reports of earnings or other material sent to stockholders,
and satisfactory assurance that it will be reimbursed by such company for out-of-pocket expenses, shall transmit
such reports of material to each beneficial owner of stock of such company held by the member organization and registered
in a name other than the name of the beneficial owner. The Exchange is qualifying Rule 585 by adding the following to
the end of the Rule: ``unless the beneficial owner has instructed the member organization in writing to transmit such
reports or material to a designated investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises
investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for such beneficial owner.''

III. Discussion and Conclusion



The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections
6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides, 

inter alia

, that the rules of an exchange be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.

The Commission believes that permitting investors to designate an investment adviser to receive proxy and related
issuer materials and vote their proxies removes impediments to a free and open market. As noted by the Exchange, investors
have been requesting that investment advisers be authorized to receive issuer materials and vote proxies for the
investor. Investors choosing an investment adviser arrangement may believe that they do not need to receive issuer
information since the investment adviser and not the investor is making investment decisions on their behalf. The
Commission acknowledges that investors might view the receipt of issuers materials and the ability to vote proxies
as part of the investment adviser's obligations to manage customer accounts. Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges
that some investors, in choosing to utilize the services of an investment adviser, are implying that they do not have
the knowledge or inclination to review complicated issuer or proxy materials or to vote proxies. These investors,
in particular, may be frustrated by being inundated with unwanted issuer materials.

The Commission also believes that the proposed rule change will permit the investment adviser to make more expedient,
informed investment decisions, thereby facilitating securities transactions in accordance with the Act. For these
reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change appropriately gives investors the freedom to choose
whether to receive proxy and related issuer materials and vote the proxies or to designate their investment adviser
to perform these functions on their behalf.

Section 6(b)(5) of the Act also provides that the rules of an exchange should protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the public interest and the protection of
investors. The Commission notes that the rule change continues to permit investors who wish to receive and vote proxies
and receive other issuer materials to do so. The rule change affords beneficial owners the choice to delegate this
authority when the beneficial owner has already granted discretion in his investment account to an investment adviser.
Despite the flexibility provided by the rule, investors will continue to have the authority to rescind their designation
of an investment adviser at any time. We note that prior to the effective date of such designation, member organizations
must provide beneficial owners written notice of their right to rescind the designation.

The Commission also believes that amending Rule 575 to allow a member organization which is the investment manager
for an ERISA Plan is consistent with the policies embodied in Section 6(b)(5) of the Act because the amendment would
conform Amex Rule 575 to NYSE Rule 450 which permits a member organization, that is designated by a named fiduciary
as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan, to vote the proxies in accordance with the its ERISA
Plan fiduciary responsibilities. The amendment to Rule 575 should facilitate transactions in securities between
Amex member firms that are dual members of the NYSE and Amex by adopting consistent proxy rules. The Commission notes
that in voting proxies as a plan fiduciary, an investment manager must consider those factors which would affect the
value of the plan's investment and is prohibited from subordinating the interests of participants and beneficiaries
in their retirement income to unrelated objectives. In addition, the Commission believes that the Exchange's amendment
should prevent potential conflicts between the Exchange rules and ERISA guidelines.

Finally, the Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which requires
that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act. The Commission believes the proposed rule change should serve to eliminate unnecessary burdens
on competition in recognition that advisers not subject to Amex rules already are able to vote proxies for their clients.


It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-3) be, and hereby is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the place specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to amend certain current terms and adopt new terms related to the NASDAQ System that more appropriately
describe the current technological facilities and services provided by this national securities market throughout
Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws) 

(``Schedule D'') and other parts of the NASD's rules and regulations in the NASD Manual. The NASD believes that the
proposed new terms will indicate more clearly the current functionality of the NASDAQ System as a market for securities
with quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and other execution capability, as well as other specialized automation
services for screen-based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational
services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issues. The proposed new terms would also
clarify that the NASDAQ System is composed of two distinct market tiers, each with different inclusion criteria that
are set forth in different parts of Schedule D. Finally, the proposed rule change would make clear that The Nasdaq Stock
Market is operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association.

Section 17 to Part I of Schedule D would be amended to replace the term ``NASDAQ'' with the term ``Nasdaq'' and to replace
the phrase ``the NASDAQ System'' with the term ``The Nasdaq Stock Market''.

The proposed rule change would add a new Section 18 to Part I of Schedule D to define the ``Nasdaq National Market'' or
``NNM'' to mean a distinct tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market comprised of securities that meet the requirements of and
are authorized as a Nasdaq National Market security

Part I, Section 18 of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section 19 and amended to replace the terms ``NASDAQ National
Market System security'' and ``NASDAQ NMS security'' with the terms ``Nasdaq National Market security'' and ``NNM
security'', and to clarify a current NASD requirement that such securities must satisfy ``all applicable requirements
of Part II'' of Schedule D as well as substantially meet the criteria set forth Part III of Schedule D. The text of the
proposed rule language to new Section 19 is based on that in Section 1 of Part II and Section 2 of Part III to Schedule D
which set forth the qualification requirements and designation criteria applicable to Nasdaq SmallCap Market and
Nasdaq National Market securities.

The proposed rule change would add a new Section 20 to Part I of Schedule D to define the term ``Nasdaq SmallCap Market
security'' or ``SCM security'' to mean any security which (i) satisfies all applicable requirements of Part II of
Schedule D other than a Nasdaq National Market security; (ii) is a right to purchase such security; or (iii) is a warrant
to subscribe to such security.

The current section (20) to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section (21). The current section (21) to Part
I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section (22) and the term ``NASDAQ'' contained therein would be replaced with
the term ``Nasdaq''. Current section (22) to (25) to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Sections (23) to (26,)
respectively.

The proposed rule change would add a new Section 27 to Part I of Schedule D to define ``The Nasdaq SmallCap Market'' or
``SCM'' to be a distinct tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market comprised of securities that meet the requirements of and are
authorized as a Nasdaq SmallCap Market security.

The current Section 19 to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section 28 and amended by replacing the current
term ``NASDAQ System'' with the term ``The Nasdaq Stock Market'' or ``Nasdaq''. Proposed Section 28 would define
The Nasdaq Stock Market as an electronic securities market comprised of competing market makers whose trading is
supported by a communications network linking them to quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and order execution
systems. Proposed Section 28 would state that The Nasdaq Stock Market also provides specialized automation services
for screen based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational
services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issuers.

Proposed Section 28 would also clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is comprised of two distinct market tiers of the
current NASDAQ System. The first tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market would be ``The Nasdaq SmallCap Market'' or ``SCM''.
The second tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market would be the ``Nasdaq National Market'' or ``NNM''.

On June 30, 1993, the NASD's corporate subsidiaries that operated and serviced the NASDAQ System, i.e. Nasdaq Inc.
and NASD Market Services, Inc., were merged into a single corporation renamed ``The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.''.
 To reflect this corporate restructuring, proposed Section 28 would clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is operated
by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association.





The proposed rule change would insert the proposed new terms, where applicable, throughout Schedule D and other parts
of the NASD's rules and regulations, including the Schedules to the By-Laws; Rules of Fair Practice; SOES Rules; ACT
Rules; FIPS Rules; Nasdaq International Services; Code of Procedure and Uniform Practice Code.

The proposed rule change would apply to all rule filings of the Association or its subsidiary, The Nasdaq Stock Market,
Inc., that are approved prior to or are pending on the date of the Commission's approval of the proposed rule change.
Moreover, the numbering of the definition sections are proposed to be amended to reflect any amendment to the definition
sections under Part I of Schedule D adopted prior to the approval of the proposed rule changes.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in
that the proposed rule change is designed to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest in that the proposed rule change would amend certain
current terms and adopt new terms relating to the NASDAQ System in order to more appropriately describe the current
technological facilities and services provided by this national securities market. The NASD believes that the proposed
new terms will indicate more clearly the current functionality of the NASDAQ System as a market for securities with
quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and order execution capability, as well as other specialized automation
services for screen-based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational
services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issuers. The proposed new terms would also
clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of two distinct market tiers, each with different inclusion criteria
in different parts of the rules. Finally, the proposed rule change would make clear that The Nasdaq Stock Market is
operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

A. by order approve such proposed rule change, or

B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order
Granting Accelerated Approved to Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Firm Quote Responsibilities
for Customer and Broker-Dealer Orders</DOCTITLE>



September 28, 1994.



On December 9, 1991, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend the Phlx's Options Floor Procedure Advice (``OFPA'') F-7 relating to firm quotes
for customer and broker-dealer orders. On September 27, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 (``Amendment No. 1'')
to the proposal to eliminate a reference to public customers in OFPA F-7 and to replace a reference to its Ten-up
rule (``ten-up'' rule) with the actual Options Floor Procedure Advice section (``OFPA A-11'') governing minimum
volume guarantees.







Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30134 (Dec. 31,
1991), 57 FR 730 (Jan. 8, 1992). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal, as amended.



I. Description of the Proposal



OFPA F-7 currently states that bid and offer prices shall be general ones and shall not be specified for acceptance
by particular members. The proposed amendment modifies OFPA F-7 to reflect the development of different execution
guarantees depending on the status of the order to be executed. Under Phlx Rule 1033(a), the current ``ten-up'' rule,
public customer orders are afforded a ten-up guarantee on the Exchange, receiving an execution of up to ten contracts
at the best market price regardless of whether size was quoted. Broker-dealer orders do not qualify for the ten-up
guarantee. Accordingly, the stated purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit floor traders to provide greater
bid and/or offer sizes (

i.e.,

 more than 10 contract guarantee) to facilitate customer orders while not being under such obligation with respect
to broker-dealer orders, unless specified. However, the proposed amendment to OFPA F-7 requires that quote
sizes be maintained equally for all orders of the same account type. Therefore, if a specialist elects to give a size
of twenty-up to one-broker-dealer, he must honor the size of twenty-up for all broker-dealer orders.



II. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers.





In approving the Phlx's ``ten-up'' in rule in June 1987,
 the Commission found that it was designed to benefit public customers by increasing the size of orders for which they
can be assured executions to a minimum depth of ten contracts at the best bid or offer as quoted by a specialist or Registered
Options Trader (``ROT''). Although the Commission carefully scrutinizes discriminatory order execution practices,
limiting the ``ten-up'' rule for public customers furthers the purposes of the Act. The intent of the ``ten-up'' rule
is to encourage options specialists and ROTs to become more competitive in making markets, thereby contributing
to a more free and open market. Because the ``ten-up'' rule was designed by the options exchanges for the benefit of
public customers, however, the incentive for market makers and ROTs to benefit public customers through the ``ten-up''
rule is contingent on the assurance that these market makers volume guarantees will not be exhausted by competitors
to the detriment of public customers.

The Commission believes that allowing floor traders to provide customers with quote sizes greater than the minimum
``ten-up'' guarantee, while not being obligated with respect to broker-dealer orders, is consistent with the Act
in that it will facilitate customer orders. The Commission also believes the rule change will encourage market participants
to make larger markets, resulting in tighter spreads, which, in turn, should contribute to more liquid options markets.
Furthermore, allowing floor traders to increase the quote sizes available to customer orders furthers the underlying
purposes of the ``ten-up'' rule. The proposal also requires that order sizes be maintained equally for all orders
of the same account type, as defined by OFPA B-6. Accordingly, if a specialist elects to give a size of twenty-up
to one broker-dealer, he must honor the size of twenty-up for all broker-dealer orders. In the absence of a stated size
to any bid or offer, the size shall be deemed to be for one contract only, subject to the minimum volume guarantees for
public customers orders, as established in Rule 1033(a). The Commission believes this requirement will help to ensure
the integrity and fairness of the Phlx's markets in that it will help prevent order discrimination within account
types. 

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 eliminates the term ``public customers'' from OFPA B-7, which was proposed in the original
filing. Because existing Phlx OFPA B-6 already distinguishes between account types, of which ``public customers''
is one type, the Commission does not believe the proposal's elimination of the term raises any new or substantive issues.
Moreover, the minimum volume guarantees afforded by Rule 1033(a) are only available to public customer orders and
the elimination of the term from OFPA B-7 does not affect the ten-up guarantee. Amendment No. 1 also replaces
a reference to the Phlx ``ten-up'' rule with a citation to OFPA A-11, which is the floor advice currently governing
minimum volume guarantees. The Commission believes this change is non-substantive and does not affect the operation
or implementation of either Rule 1033(a), OFPA A-11, or the filing. 



III. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by October 26, 1994. 

It therefore is ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-91-46) is approved, as amended.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

by a Contractowner's employer. Additional premium payments of at least $100 may be paid at any time during the accumulation
period. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments.

5. Premium taxes are deducted by TIAA from premium payments prior to allocation to the Separate Account in states that
impose a premium tax charge when a premium is paid. In states that impose a premium tax later, TIAA deducts the appropriate
amount when the tax is incurred.

6. When additional portfolios are added to the Separate Account, Contractowners will be allowed to transfer among
available portfolios during the accumulation period. TIAA reserves the right to limit the number of transfers among
portfolios to once in any 90-day period. Currently, no charge is made for transfers.
7. TIAA imposes a daily administrative expense charge at an effective annual rate of 0.20% of the net assets of the Separate
Account. Applicants represent that this charge is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act and is
not greater than the expected cost of the administrative services to be provided over the life of the Contract. TIAA
does not expect or intend to earn a surplus from the administrative expense charge. The rate of the charge is guaranteed
not to increase for the duration of the Contracts and is applicable only during the period from the date of issue of the
Contract until the end of the accumulation period.
8. A daily investment advisory fee is deducted from the net assets of the Separate Account and paid to Teachers Advisors,
Inc. (``Advisors''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIAA VA Holdings, Inc. Advisors will be registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The investment advisory fee will be 0.30% of the average daily net
assets of the Separate Account. Advisors has agreed to waive a portion of the advisory fee so that the current effective
annual rate will be 0.10% of the average daily net assets of the Separate Account.
9. TIAA deducts a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 0.25% of the average daily net
asset value of the Separate Account: approximately .06% for mortality risks and .19% for expense risks. TIAA reserves
the right to increase this charge to an effective annual rate of 1.00% of the net assets of each portfolio of the Separate
Account (approximately .20% for mortality risks and .80% for expense risks) and guarantees that this charge will
never exceed 1.00%.
10. The mortality risks assumed by TIAA arise from its contractual obligation to make annuity payment in accordance
with the provisions of the Contracts regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant lives. In addition,
TIAA assumes the risk that the total premiums paid under a Contract less any cash withdrawals exceed the account value
of a Contract when a death benefit becomes payable. The death benefit under the Contract is the greater of (a) account
value or (b) total premiums paid less cash withdrawals.
11. The expense risk assumed by TIAA is that actual expenses involved in administering the Contracts (including Contract
maintenance costs, administrative costs, mailing costs, data processing costs, and costs of other services) may
exceed the amount recovered from the administrative expense charge.


Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or
underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited
with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing
bookkeeping and other administrative services.
2. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) exempting the from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940
Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge from the assets of the Separate
Account under the Contracts.
3. Applicants represent that the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is within the range of industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information
about similar annuity products, taking into consideration such factors as the current charge levels, existence
of charge level guarantees, any death benefit guarantees, guaranteed annuity rates, and other policy options. TIAA
represents that it will maintain at its administrative offices a memorandum, available to the Commission, setting
forth in detail this analysis.
4. If the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is insufficient to cover actual costs, the loss will be borne by TIAA. Conversely,
if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a profit to TIAA. TIAA does not expect a profit
from this charge during the first years of the Separate Account's operation. To the extent this charge results in a
surplus to TIAA, such surplus will be available for use by TIAA for the payment of distribution, sales, and other expenses.
Applicants represent that no separate charge for distribution expenses will be imposed upon the assets of the Separate
Account unless and until the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act have been complied with.

5. TIAA represents that it has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing
arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and Contractowners. The basis for this conclusion is set forth in a
memorandum that will be maintained by TIAA at its administrative offices and that will be available to the Commission
upon request.

6. TIAA represents that it will have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons within the meaning
of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution
expenses.

7. Applicants also request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Section 12(b) of the 1940
Act and Rule 12b-1 thereunder, insofar as this proposed distribution financing arrangement might be deemed
to involve the direct or indirect use of assets in the Separate Account for distribution.

8. Section 12(b) of the 1940 Act prohibits a registered investment company from acting as a distributor of securities
of which it is the distributor, except through an underwriter. Rule 12b-1 prohibits any such company directly
or indirectly from financing distribution of the company's shares except in compliance with the rule's requirements.
The rule requires that a company financing distribution of its shares formulate a written plan describing all material
aspects of the proposed arrangement and that the plan be approved initially by the company's shareholders, directors,
and disinterested directors. The directors must vote annually to continue a plan and the directors must conclude
that there is a reasonable likelihood that implementation or continuation of the plan will benefit the company and
its shareholders.

9. Applicants expect to finance the expenses of distributing the Contracts through the use of TIAA's general assets,
which may be attributable in part to any surplus from the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. Thus, the proposed distribution
financing arrangement might be deemed to involve the direct or indirect use of assets in the Separate Account for distribution.
Accordingly, Applicants represent that this aspect of the requested relief is solely ``defensive,'' 

i.e.,

 to clarify that the current distribution financing arrangement is not subject to Section 12(b) or Rule 12b-1
thereunder. Applicants contend that the requested exemptive relief is not intended to cover the imposition of a separate
charge for distribution expenses against the assets in the Separate Account, and acknowledge that any such distribution
charge would only be assessed in compliance with Rule 12b-1.

10. Applicants assert that Rule 12b-1 was not intended to apply to managed accounts, and that the rule's provisions
are directed only at traditional mutual funds and should not be applied to managed accounts. Applicants further assert
that the protections of Rule 12b-1 are not necessary in the case of managed accounts. Applicants state that Commission
review under Section 26 and 27 of the 1940 Act of the reasonableness of asset charges of managed accounts, and explicit
prospectus disclosure that the asset charge may be used for distribution expenses, provide sufficient protection
for Contractowners and obviate the need for a managed account to comply with the requirements of Rule 12b-1.

11. Applicants assert that the application of Rule 12b-1 to managed accounts would produce a burdensome and
inequitable treatment of these accounts, would place them at an unfair competitive disadvantage with respect to
trust accounts offering similar annuity contracts, and would create an artificial distinction between managed
and trust accounts not justified by policy considerations.



Conclusion



Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
12(b), 26(a)(2)(C) and 27 (c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 12b-1 thereunder, to deduct the Mortality and Expense
Risk Charge from the assets of the Separate Account under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940
Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.
